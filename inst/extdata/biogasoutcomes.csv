01,2021-05-31,1,"Okay, where did the digester originate?","It came from a certain company in Blantyre, Chileka"
01,2021-05-31,2,"Okay, who designed the digester?",It was them -- We just bought them the digestor and they build and installed it too.
01,2021-05-31,3,"Okay, what was the price?","We bought it at K190, 000. On top of that, there were some other cost like transport, manure and all that which made it K228, 000. And there is also another K48, 000 which I haven't paid. So roughly, it's K270, 000."
01,2021-05-31,4,How did you know about biogas?,"I came to know biogas through a friend. She is very interested in biogas, and she lives within the community, just after the transformer area. She went to Blantyre to meet with the guys I bought the digester from, when she came back, she told me about the meeting and biogas. Then, I became very interested too."
01,2021-05-31,5,What interested you?,The fact that you can use waste for cooking and lighting.
01,2021-05-31,6,What were your expectations?,"Mmmh, our expectation is that we are going to be able to use biogas for cooking. We hope to reduce cooking problems as well as health problems my wife usually suffers. She suffers from respiratory diseases when she cooks using firewood. Also, we expect to stop using firewood completely due to environmental concern. On top of that, we are very much into farming and we produce more manure, and we want to expand so we hope to be able to produce even more manure and biogas for cooking"
01,2021-05-31,7,"Okay, what were you told to expect from the installer?","We were told that we can use the biogas for cooking, lighting and also to generate electricity which we can use for hours but to do that we need a generator which turn biogas into electricity. All you do is, you put fuel in the generator then modify the generator by connecting it to a carburettor. Some people are even using this method for irrigation - That's where we are going, and we will get there."
01,2021-05-31,8,How did you know this? I mean this is so technical.,"I was interested to know more about biogas so I inquired more from the supplier. The other thing about biogas is that it's a source of manure. When the feedstock decomposes it produces effluent which can be used as manure, or can be sold. I'm sure I will get to that level once I move to my own compound where I will do things with a bit of freedom and flexibility."
01,2021-05-31,9,"Okay, what kind of training were you given by the installers?","No, but I'm a person who can easily understand things. So, whatever he said I was able to grasp and comprehend what he was saying. He talked about its operation -- if it does this do that. So, that was the type of training I received. Secondly, all the information regarding biogas in on the internet, on YouTube we are able to see and learn ourselves. For example, me and my friend we have been on internet browsing and sharing these things. So to me that's enough training, and I don't think I need any other type of training. As a matter of fact, I can purchase and confidently install and run a biogas system."
01,2021-05-31,10,Why did you choose to have one built here?,We wanted to make life easier for us in terms of cooking. As you can see we have lots of chicken so we want to use the manure to produce energy for cooking.
01,2021-05-31,11,How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? (I.e. cook),"We were using firewood, and sometimes we were using briskets and charcoal. It's mostly firewood though**.** And It\`s sad because such means damage the environment."
01,2021-05-31,12,How did you manage your waste (the feedstock) before the reactor?,We used animal waste as manure in the garden and some of it we just throw away.
01,2021-05-31,13,"You said you just tried it out, and have never utilised it fully. So, how did the system work after installation?","Unfortunately, we don't have a mechanism to measure the gas that was produced. However, we tried to cook on it, and we were excited that we were able to cook something with it. And that was what we wanted to see (Laughs)"
01,2021-05-31,14,(Laughs) what did you cook?,"We cooked a side dish. But, before that we boiled water. And considering that we didn't load adequate feedstock, we were convinced with its output."
01,2021-05-31,15,Where were the operation requirements?,"Initially, we were supposed to feed the digester with cow dung. They installer explained that first feed needed to be cow dung because it's a ruminant and that its dung has a high bacterial load crucial to initiate the system. Thereafter, we could use any other type of manure e.g. goat, chicken and pig manure. However, we have not used it for some months now, so I have asked a certain person to bring me cow manure tomorrow to kick-start it again."
01,2021-05-31,16,"So, manure is the core operation requirement. Okay, what else?",Definitely.
01,2021-05-31,17,How did you prepare that feedstock?,"You put dung in a bucket and add water. Actually, you use fresh dung and not dry dung for this purpose. Then, you mix the mixture till it reached a level it can be easily poured from the bucket. Essentially, we add 5 buckets of water to 5 buckets of manure. We were told to feed 5 buckets of 25 Litres."
01,2021-05-31,18,What were the maintenance requirements?,"There is little maintenance that required. You need to check the frame on the stove. Also, you need to constantly monitor gas pressure in the digester to detect leakages. So, we are required to check these things time and again to ensure that it keeps on working."
01,2021-05-31,19,Who is responsible for feeding the digestor?,"This is a household so we are supposed to feed the digester. Their responsibility was to install the digester which they are only remaining with building a green house, after that everything else is our responsibility."
01,2021-05-31,20,What challenges have you encountered so far?,"The only challenge we have encountered was when we mounted the digester in a cage. The pressure was very high that it was breaking the cage time and again. So, we were reporting to the installers time and again about the problem and it was a annoying thing to do. So they came and decided that the cages containing the bags should be placed underground to resist the pressure. After, that did that we have not had any problem with the digester."
01,2021-05-31,21,"Oh, pressure was breaking metal cage?","Yes, it's not any ordinary pressure. It\`s high pressure that heats up the bag and inflated to a point you think it's about to burst."
01,2021-05-31,22,"You have never used, excerpt the time you tried it?","It's not long since I tried it. It's been a month or two. I haven't been able to finish the project because I'm also doing a house project somewhere. So, yes, that's the only time it ever worked and I ever tried it."
01,2021-05-31,23,"Once the digester started to break the cage, did you try to fix it? What did you do?","That's when I called the installer, and he suggested that in my case the digester bag was supposed to be buried in the ground. And since then we haven't had the problem."
01,2021-05-31,24,"Now that it's not working, you said you are using firewood?","Yes, we can't say we stopped using firewood. We are still using firewood and charcoal. But if he comes with the manure tomorrow we are going to keep it up and we hope to stop using firewood. Also, I'm hoping to buy cement any day from now because I want to build a floor for the stalls so that I will be able to harvest enough and quality dung for the digester."
01,2021-05-31,25,How much labour do you think went into building this in terms of digging?,"It was about four people because they wanted to do it within 2 hours. But, I believe even one person would have managed to do it but would have taken a day or two."
01,2021-05-31,26,Masonry?,It was one person.
01,2021-05-31,27,Was there any other work?,"Yes, fabrication which was done by one person."
01,2021-05-31,28,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,"The biodigester is not from Malawi because they tried to liaise with local companies to supply them with the biodigester, but it has not worked."
01,2021-05-31,29,What is your opinion of biogas?,"Biogas is a good thing but it has taken time to reach Malawi. Otherwise, we need more people to learn about biogas because it will improve the livelihood of many people in the urban and rural community. Also, I believe has the potential of reducing deforestation, I know we can't completely stop using firewood, but biogas can reduce firewood use drastically."
01,2021-05-31,30,"If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?","People are using solar, and I think is a good alternative of biogas because it reduces misuse of trees. And people are using solar in doing great things in Malawi, you talk of irrigation. Also, I think here in Africa solar is the way to go because we are naturally blessed with the sun, so let's use that opportunity to produce energy."
01,2021-05-31,31,"Thanks for the interview, I truly appreciate.",NA
02,2021-05-31,1,"Okay, where did the digester originate?",Welcome. # SMALL-SCALE BIOGAS DIGESTERS AS DEVELOPMENT AID: TALES OF HUBRIS AND FAILURE
02,2021-05-31,2,I presume the students were whites?,"It came with students from Chancellor College, together with \[name redacted\]."
02,2021-05-31,3,"Okay, who designed the digester?","Yes, it was \[name redacted\] and his colleagues. I don't remember the names of the others. What they said was that all of them were from Sweden, but from different parts of Sweden. For example here in Malawi, we can say some were from Mzuzu, Zomba, and Blantyre -- But, all the three students were from Sweden."
02,2021-05-31,4,"Okay, why do you say that?",It was them -- the whites.
02,2021-05-31,5,"Okay, who provided money for the digester to be built here?",It was them who were mostly involved in the installation work with little assistance from \[name redacted\].
02,2021-05-31,6,"So, you paid the boys?","Ahh, I am not quite sure -- What I saw was them bringing bricks and cement, so I couldn't tell where they got the money, and who was paying for the materials and equipment. My only role was to provide land and water for construction of the system. Also, I identified two boys who assisted with construction work."
02,2021-05-31,7,"Okay, it was the 2 boys who built it... I mean who built it?","No, the boys were not paid. What \[name redacted\] did was, he thanked them at the end with touch devices with phone battery charging capabilities for their involvement. For the reason that in some instances the boys would excuse themselves to go charge phones at phone charging centers."
02,2021-05-31,8,"Okay great...... Umhu, clearly there are many households and people within this community, so how were you selected as a beneficiary out of the many?","Ahh, No, I can't say it was the 2 boys. The two boys were involved in digging work as well as helping with other work like mixing of mortar. The other work like installation of equipment was done by the whites and \[name redacted\] because the local boys didn't have the expertise to do that."
02,2021-05-31,9,(Laughs) what made you think that it was LEAD Malawi or the Forestry Department that connected you with \[name redacted\] and his team?,"Aaaah, I believe they got my name from LEAD Malawi or from the forestry department because I have worked with these institutions for quite a long time. Yet, I'm not really sure about it. And when they came to me, it did not cross my mind to ask how and why I was selected as a beneficiary because I was very excited about the thought of having a new things which I could use for cooking -- So I didn't care about enquiring anything because of the excitement (Laughs) -- It was just like Manna from Heaven for me! (Laughs)"
02,2021-05-31,10,"Okay! Before \[name redacted\] and his team came to you, did you know about biogas?","Mmmh okay, it's because if you look at the biogas digester, it's a technology that when in use protects the environment because it eliminates the use of firewood. Thus, LEAD Malawi and forestry department being organisations whose objective is to protecting the environment, and me being a volunteer of Forest department and a secretary of their community group since 2006 made me believe that is why they chose me to be a beneficiary."
02,2021-05-31,11,What were your expectations?,"Yes, I learnt that manure can be used to produce energy for cooking and lighting. I learnt this in school - It was just theory, and not practical. This was back in 1996 when I was in Standard 8. Yet, my first experience with the technology was when \[name redacted\] []{.mark}came with news that they were coming to install the technology, and eventually they installed the technology on my backward. Thus, I saw it as an opportunity to learn more about the technology, and I was excited to use the technology. Unfortunately, I was unable to use the technology as I expected."
02,2021-05-31,12,"(Laughs) Okay! Okay! When \[name redacted\] and his colleagues came, what were you told to expect?","From the knowledge I had, my expectation was that I was going to use the technology for cooking. I expected that everything that I would eat that needed cooking I was going to use the technology. This explains why I was willing to find people to assist them with the work. It also explains why I even supplied them with piped water which is paid for, instead of simply collecting water from the borehole which is far from this house and free. I was very excited because at the end of project, I was going to own the technology."
02,2021-05-31,13,Did he mention what the selection process was like?,"Initially, he simply came to inform me that he was going to come with students from Chanco to do practicals on biogas, and that they had selected me as a beneficiary of that project."
02,2021-05-31,14,"You have said from previous knowledge you expected to use biogas for cooking, I want to know, what were you told to expect from the technology by \[name redacted\] and his team?","Ahh, he didn't explain anything pertaining to that. He just said they had selected me as a beneficiary on the biogas project. Personally, it wasn't surprising because they were not the first people to come and work with me under such circumstances. Many people and organisations approach me to work with, just like you have done - They simply explain their agenda; we talk and then take off from there. So, I didn't ask many questions, and I suspected that they were referred to me by the Forestry department -- just like I said. I do Agroforestry work with Forest department."
02,2021-05-31,15,Oh great! So how long did it take to cease working?,"I was told that I could use the technology for cooking, and after installation the system was producing gas, and as a matter of fact, when they were leaving they tested it by boiling water, and it worked. It took like the time you been here (10 minutes) for the water to heat up and boil."
02,2021-05-31,16,"Okay, what kind of training were you given by the installers?","It never really worked. Actually, for the digester to work and produce gas someone had to squeeze and release the gas pipe to force it to produce enough gas and pressure for cooking. They said the stove was no the recommended for the system, that's why it was not producing enough gas and pressure.... If one didn't press and release the gas pipe, one couldn't cook or boil anything with it because the heat that was being produced was very low."
02,2021-05-31,17,Zero?,"No, I was not trained in any way."
02,2021-05-31,18,Ooh?,Yes.
02,2021-05-31,19,"So, we can say you were trained how to prepare the feedstock, and how to produce more gas and heat under the then conditions. What else were you trained?","Yes, they only demonstrated to me how to prepare the feedstock. I was told how to mix and stir manure and cover manure in a bucket. Then after three day I was told to put feedstock in the digester. Accordingly, the same way they showed me how to mix feedstock, I was doing it. I didn't for some time. After some time I stop it. What really made me stop and eventually stop using the digester was the fact that I had to press and release the gas pipe during cooking. It was more less like I was doing two things at once. When I was cooking, instead of leaving the pot on the fire to do other things, I was going outside the kitchen to press and release the gas pipe -- you see that! -- If I weren't pressing and releasing the gas pipe, I couldn't get fire."
02,2021-05-31,20,"Okay, so after you were trained how to prepare feedstock, how prepared to run operate the reactor did you feel you were?",There was nothing else!
02,2021-05-31,21,"From what I have heard, you did not you choose to build a digester? /have one built here; it was \[name redacted\] and his team who brought it here on their own accord.....","Because I had no prior experience with the technology, I felt that what they had taught me was enough to run the system. But when I look back - if it was now, and someone come and teach me how to prepare feedstock and everything else they told me, I would say it's not enough to operate the reactor because certain people taught me that and it wasn't enough. It didn't work!"
02,2021-05-31,22,"Okay, how did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? (i.e. cook)","Ummhu, Yes, he chose to build it here because he wanted his students to do practicals. But, I can't say that's why it failed to work. It failed to work because they didn't have enough equipment. For example, the stove, if the stove was available and producing gas and fire, I would have been more interested to use the technology, and eventually it wouldn't have failed -- It failed because it didn't work properly in the first place. Then, that's when I decided to remove the stove and pipes, after I got fed up with technology."
02,2021-05-31,23,"Okay...... Apart from firewood, what else were you meeting your energy needs?",I was using firewood for cooking.
02,2021-05-31,24,Where were you getting firewood for cooking?,There was nothing else I was using aside from firewood.
02,2021-05-31,25,"I remember you mentioned that you were using manure to run the digester, where were you getting the manure?","From the mountain. Plus, we have lots of trees around the compound. We also have a woodlot within. That one you see, that's ours."
02,2021-05-31,26,Did you use your own manure at some point?,They brought the first manure in two black containers; I guess they were 250L containers.
02,2021-05-31,27,"Okay, before the reactor, how did you manage your manure waste?","Yes, I did after they had left."
02,2021-05-31,28,"Okay sure. After everything was done, how did the system work?","I had pits where I was dumping the dung. After sometime, I was collecting the dung, and use it as fertilizer at my farm."
02,2021-05-31,29,So they said they couldn't get the stove here in Malawi but in Kenya.,"As far as I'm concerned, it didn't work well. If it had worked well after commissioning, I'm sure you would have found it working today or else recently broken. Nonetheless, on their part it worked well because I believe they wanted to see if manure can produce energy for cooking, and it did. So, to them it was a success. And even myself, I can testify that manure really produce energy for cooking because I saw it too. All in all, it didn't assist me in anyway because it never worked since it did not produce energy for cooking because the stove was not compatible with the system -- That's what they told me. Because I asked what the problem was, they said the problem was certainly the stove. They said they needed to buy the stove from Kenya, and once they replace the stove things would change. But, since then they have never returned."
02,2021-05-31,30,"And they said they were going to bring the stove and install it, and finalize everything?","Yes, that's what they told me."
02,2021-05-31,31,Did they tell you how long it was going to take them to buy and bring the stove here in Malawi?,Yes
02,2021-05-31,32," **Interviewer**: That was 2014, and now we are in 2021. Why do you think they didn't bring and install the stove?","Mhhh, they never said it, and I didn't ask because I was certain that they were going to bring it, and it wouldn't take a very long time."
02,2021-05-31,33,"(Laughs) Let me put it to you, there are many people who they could have chosen to build the biogas on their premise, or worse still they could have done their practicals everywhere else even at Chanco, why do you think they bothered to come here?","Like I said, they got what they wanted. They wanted to see if manure can produce energy. Their objective was not for me to possess and use the biogas system. If their objective was for me to use biogas, I'm sure they would have brought the stoves in the first place or bought the stove by now."
02,2021-05-31,34,(Laughs) what makes you think they got to you because you had many cattle?,(Laughs) I don't really know. Only \[name redacted\] knows. It could also be because I was well known to have many cows around the community. It could also be because of my affiliation with LEAD and Forest department.
02,2021-05-31,35,"Okay**,** how much gas was being produced?","Biogas needs manure to run so because they saw that I had lots cattle, they knew that I might be able to run it, unlike someone without cattle."
02,2021-05-31,36,And you weren't told how much gas it was producing?,"I wasn't taught. Also, to know how much gas was being produced, it would mean I had measuring equipment. And I wasn't exposed to the measuring equipment and any other technical aspects, but they had measuring equipment and they were testing things all the time and I'm sure they must have recorded how much gas was being produced."
02,2021-05-31,37,"Let try to measure it may be by using simple methods. How long were you using it in terms cooking? Let's say how many meals, how much long would it take to boil water?",Yes.
02,2021-05-31,38,"You said you were using manure, what were other operation requirements?",I never really used it because I couldn't be doing two things at once. I never used it.
02,2021-05-31,39,"Okay, how much manure was needed to operate?",They just talked about manure and that was what they used to produce gas. I didn't see them bringing any other material **-** No! Excerpt other equipment and pipes which gas was circulating in. So basically manure was used to operate the biogas system.
02,2021-05-31,40,How much feedstock were you putting after three days?,"No, I wasn't told how much manure would be required. I was just told to mix manure and water then stir and cover. After sometime to stir and cover again and so on, for three days. Then after that, I was supposed to put the feedstock into the three bags through inlets made of the blue standing pipes."
02,2021-05-31,41,"Oh, if you put 16 litres, there was no overflow?","As you have seen, there are three inlets so I was supposed to put a 16 Litre bucket of manure in each inlet after every three days. And when the inlets where full, there was an outlet which was overflowing so you knew the bags were full."
02,2021-05-31,42,"Oh, I understand. How did you know that the feedstock was ready after three day?","No, there was already manure in the digester bags so I was simply refilling manure that was already in the bags. Thus, sometimes I could feed less than 16 Litres and it would overflow."
02,2021-05-31,43,"Let me see if I have got you correctly. You had three 16 litre buckets, you were mixing manure with water, stir and cover for three days. After three day that's when you were feeding the digester.","Like I said, I was simply gathering manure in a bucket then I was adding water and stir. We stirred the mix to breakdown manure to a level where there were no lumps. But, even when I saw that it was broken down perfectly and it was smooth, but if it wasn't after three days I could not feed the digester because I was told to feed the digester with manure after three days."
02,2021-05-31,44,"Okay, why after 3 days?","Ummhu, Spot on."
02,2021-05-31,45,"Okay, how much water did you add?",That's when manure is matured and ready to produce gas.
02,2021-05-31,46,Ummhu...,"I can't say I was adding a specific amount of water then I would be lying. But it was more manure than water. I wasn't measuring the mixture, and I didn't saw \[name redacted\] and his team mixing a specific amount of manure with water, and I don't think they had a specific amount of mixture for manure and water. They simply told me to add water to the manure."
02,2021-05-31,47,"Okay, who was responsible for feeding the digestor?","I was told to have a mixture where I could be able to stir but I wasn't told the exact amount of water I was supposed add to the manure. In most cases though, it was half water and half manure. That was enough to have a proper mixture where I could manage to stir in a 16 litre bucket."
02,2021-05-31,48,Was there a time you ran out of manure?,It was only me as the owner of the house.
02,2021-05-31,49,"Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?","No! No! I had plenty of cattle, goats and pigs then. There was no shortage of manure. Maybe, in the future I could have run out of manure, but it never occurred. The time I abandoned the biogas, I had plenty of manure because I was keeping manure for this purpose rather than piling manure in a pit for manure."
02,2021-05-31,50,(Laughs) you though they were not done? .................,"They did not talk about maintenance. The last encounter we had they simply said they were not done with the work and they were going to come back to install the stove and finalize the work in a little while. As a result, I had no opportunity to ask how I could fix the biogas or anything if anything went wrong because I thought they were coming to finalize everything in a short time. I believed then that was the right time to ask about maintenance issues and anything else."
02,2021-05-31,51,"Okay, did it meet your needs?","To me they were not done, but they were done in their sight because they had seen manure producing gas and fire. So, to me the work wasn't done because they had not installed the stove which they promised to install. Even the time they were leaving they didn't carry all their materials. For instance, they left three buckets and one drum so I was sure they were coming back as they said."
02,2021-05-31,52,(Laughs) not even a quarter?,"No, far from it. No even a quarter (Laughs)"
02,2021-05-31,53,Why do you say that?,"(Laughs) Yes, not even a quarter."
02,2021-05-31,54,"If you press and release the gas pipe continuously, things could boil and get cooked perfectly?","I didn't manage to use. Once you open the gas and start cooking, nothing could boil. Only a small volume of water would warm up. Unless you press and release the gas pipe continuously to allow gas to flow, then things could boil. It was very tiresome and discouraging."
02,2021-05-31,55,"Okay, why didn't you just seal pipe to allow gas to flow through the pipes?",Yes.
02,2021-05-31,56,Who told you that?,"No, you couldn't do that because it would block the flow of gas. It wasn't like gas was leaking from the pipe. Alternatively, I could step and release on the digester bags because they were in the open, and when I did that enough gas was produced to cook on**.**"
02,2021-05-31,57,"Okay, what challenges were there?",They told me.
02,2021-05-31,58,No other challenges?,"Aaaah, I didn't nit have any other problem besides that."
02,2021-05-31,59,"How long did you use it for before it stopped working? Like when did you stop pressing and releasing the gas pipe, and say I'm not using this anymore?",Yes.
02,2021-05-31,60,"So, in those 4 months, there was never a point where you could cook without pressing and releasing the gas pipe or step on the digester bags?",It didn't last 5 months. It must be 4 months from the day they departed.
02,2021-05-31,61,Did you try to fix it on your own?,"No, there was never a time it worked without doing that. So after 4 months, I kept everything intact, the pipes and the installation, for 2 more years hoping that one day they were going to come. After 2 years that's when I gave up completely that they were not coming back to install the stove."
02,2021-05-31,62,Did they leave their contacts so that you could call them?,"No, there was nothing I could do. Imagine if the experts and the owners couldn't fix it, couldn't manage to have the digester produce enough gas for cooking, it was obvious that I couldn't fix it. Only if they had left it working properly, and told me what to do when gas was coming of short then maybe I could have tried to fix it."
02,2021-05-31,63,Why didn't you call them?,"I'm not sure..... Oh, yes, I had their numbers"
02,2021-05-31,64,Have you seen something like this this?,"I wasn't supposed to call them. They were the ones who chose me as a beneficiary so in the same spirit they should have ensured that everything was okay before handing me the digester - what was the problem? I couldn't call them like I was asking them to repay back a loan, calling them would have seemed like they owed me a loan. It was them who were supposed to be in the forefront to ensure that everything was okay. If they couldn't get me on the phone, they knew my house so they could have come if they were serious. Then after all that, I realized that they didn't bring the biogas for me to use, but it for them to do their practicals. That's why when they saw that it produced gas they didn't even bother to come back. They simply wanted a household to do their practicals and they got one -- \[my\] house,"
02,2021-05-31,65,Let's suppose you were given something like that. Do you think it would have helped you? And what do you think about this kind of information?,No.
02,2021-05-31,66,How would you describe the current state of the digester?,"It's helpful, because I can know how to read so I would use it to solve problems regarding biogas defects. However, in my case, like I mentioned, it wouldn't have helped because they left the problem and told me that a stove would solve the problem. The solution for this digester was a recommended stove for the digester."
02,2021-05-31,67,"To cut the long story short, how did it reach this state? In your opinion, what is the cause?","There is no digester. Can you say you have seen a digester? There is none -- but I know I had a digester at some point. We had people who worked on the digester, including men I sourced who assisted them with the work, and had I know that time that they were here for practicals I wouldn't have bothered to source them to assist them. I would have just let them hire men to help them. Without the men sourced, they wouldn't have completed the work because if the boys were not present they were not doing anything -- they were so dependent on the boys I sourced. They were even waiting for them to come to start their work -- can white people dig? No (Laugh) you see that."
02,2021-05-31,68,What do you do for energy now that the reactor isn't working?,"The digestor was not producing enough gas that's why I abandoned it. If it were producing enough gas, I wouldn't have abandoned it because I was very much interested in biogas. What pulled me off was the fact that I had to keep pressing and releasing so that I could cook. So it was time consuming, and it couldn't allow me to do other things while I was cooking.... But, I know he's around, because he never bothered to call or anything that's why he didn't want come after he left."
02,2021-05-31,69,From the forest?,I use firewood.
02,2021-05-31,70,Has there been a time you have run out of wood?,There is not much wood in the forest. I just use firewood from trees within the compound.
02,2021-05-31,71,"You said you were using cow, goat and sheep manure, How do you manage your such waste now that the reactor isn't working?","No, I have enough trees around."
02,2021-05-31,72,How much did the reactor cost to build?,"I don't have cattle, goats and pigs as I used to. The little I have I collect and put it a pit, then later use it as manure."
02,2021-05-31,73,What was the bill?,"I going to lie. I don't know where they were getting the bricks; I didn't know the price of cement, pipes and everything. I only know the bill of the water they used, and had I know they cane to do practical I would have asked them to pay the bill -- What they did is pure impertinence!"
02,2021-05-31,74,How much labor do you think went into building digging?,I don't know the actual amount. And didn't care much because I was very excited to own a biogas and I knew the benefits of using the biogas for cooking were going to outweigh the cost of water bill.
02,2021-05-31,75,Masonry,Two people -- It was \[name redacted\] and \[name redacted\].
02,2021-05-31,76,In total we can say it took 6 people to do the work?,"The two, together with \[name redacted\]"
02,2021-05-31,77,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,"Yes, it was basically 6 people, however, in some instance they would call me to help as well."
02,2021-05-31,78,Maybe the stoves.,I don't know anything.
02,2021-05-31,79,Did the reactor save you money in terms of energy consumption?,"Yes, that's what they told me."
02,2021-05-31,80,We are going towards the end of our interview. We are remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas?,It didn't save me money because I rarely used it. I used it when I felt like I was not in a rush and had no other things to do. That's when I would go press and release the gas pipe. I did that for 4 months hoping they would come one day but they never came.
02,2021-05-31,81,What else from that?,Biogas is a good is a thing because when you are using it you don't need firewood in the process protecting the environment.
02,2021-05-31,82,"Last one. If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?","Also, it's important because it makes use of manure which in most cases is left unattended, and useless. So you can say I was killing two birds with one stone. I was able to sell milk from the cattle and at the same time I was using manure to produce energy for cooking. To cut the long story short, biogas is a good thing, and if in Malawi we could have at least 10 people in every district using biogas, we are going to protect and rejuvenate the environment because people would stop using firewood."
02,2021-05-31,83,"Thanks for the interview, I truly appreciate.","I don't think there is no other alternative. The only alternative is electricity which requires more money. You can't trade biogas with solar because solar requires very powerful and expensive panels to use for cooking. I have a solar system, but I can't use it for cooking. So, I would say I can't choose anything else other than biogas itself."
03,2021-06-01,1,Where did this digester originate?,Welcome. **[SMALL-SCALE BIOGAS DIGESTERS AS DEVELOPMENT AID: TALES OF HUBRIS AND FAILURE]{.underline}**
03,2021-06-01,2,What is name of the contractor?,It was brought here by contractors.
03,2021-06-01,3,Is it the same guy who built the one at Mangochi Prison? I think I saw on YouTube his Mangochi Prison work.,It wasn't like it was a company or an organization. It was two individuals. \[name redacted\] and some guy - I have forgotten the other. They are well known across the country for building biogas system-- they have just started though.
03,2021-06-01,4,Who designed it?,"Yes, he said so."
03,2021-06-01,5,"Okay, who funded it?",It was the same people.
03,2021-06-01,6,"I have seen structures there, the green house and other things, who built that digester?",It was a project of United Purpose done in conjunction with European Union.
03,2021-06-01,7,"So at Mulanje Prison, what was your role?",It was the same two guys who brought the digester.
03,2021-06-01,8,Could you please elaborate on that?,It was funded by donors so our role was to provide guidance on aspects related to this premise.
03,2021-06-01,9,"We have many prisons in Malawi, if we go to Chikwawa we will find one, if we go to Blantyre we will find one. So, how were you selected as a beneficiary?",We provide guidance as to where the digester was supposed to be built talking into future developmental plans as well as security of the prison.
03,2021-06-01,10,"Before this intervention, did you know about biogas?","We used to have problems with electricity and cooking equipment that we were forced to cut down tree for firewood within Mulanje mountain which was damaging the environment drastically. As such were prioritized to protect trees from Mulanje Mountain, so I believe that's why we were prioritized among other prisons in Malawi."
03,2021-06-01,11,Looking at the selection process was it like they looked at all the prisons or what was the selection process like?,"No, we didn't."
03,2021-06-01,12,What were your expectations?,"I can't really know, but I believe there were high level discussions. All I know we were partners with United Purpose so they were supporting Mulanje Prison unlike other prisons. So I believe that's why they decided to choose Mulanje prison to be a beneficiary."
03,2021-06-01,13,What were you told to expect?,"We had high expectations as I told you we were having cooking problems so we expected to solve this problem. Also, we were very much involved in cutting down of tree for firewood. So, we hoped to reduce firewood use which contributes to deforestation and environmental degradation. On top of that, we expected to drastically reduce use of electricity which was going to help reduce electricity bills."
03,2021-06-01,14,Why did they say chemicals and detergents should not be allowed into the system?,"We were told that the system would help us reduce cooking time as it produces hot flames. We were also told that the system is very durable with a long life span, long as we avoid introducing chemicals or detergents into the digester. To do that we were told to close all valves so that no chemical would go into the system. Also, if we used detergents, we were required to close down the system for at least 3 days so that detergents would flush out the system. They also said with the coming in of the digester we were going to be in a better position to cook more food at once as the stoves were bigger than the ones which we were using with electricity. And lastly they said it's easily to maintain."
03,2021-06-01,15,Why did they say it's easy to maintain?,They said digesters heavily rely on bacterial activity so introduction of chemicals would kill bacteria and eventually shut the system.
03,2021-06-01,16,"After installation, what kind of training were you given by the installers?","They said the pipes which were installed do not easily get punctured because gas which passes through the pipes does get hot that it damages the pipes. On top of that, they said once the system was installed there are less operation requirements. All we need to do was feed the digester with feedstock -- it does need any maintenance."
03,2021-06-01,17,How many were trained? And who participated in the training?,We were told how to start it - for instance we were told to ensure that all the valves were open during ignition.
03,2021-06-01,18,How many?,They selected staff and prisoner.
03,2021-06-01,19,Were you part of the 15 people?,It was about 15 people.
03,2021-06-01,20,How prepared to run operate the reactor did you feel you were after the training?,Yes...
03,2021-06-01,21,"What about maintenance, did you feel you were prepared to maintain it?",We felt very much prepared to run the reactor since there was nothing complicated about switching it on.
03,2021-06-01,22,How were you supposed to resolve these issues?,"Yes, we learn how to solve gas leakage problems, as well as how to kick start it once chemicals shut down the system."
03,2021-06-01,23,How long was this training?,"By replacing leaking pipes or sealing punctured pipes and equipment. In regards to chemical shutting down the system, we were told to allow water to flush out chemicals in the digester and ensure that feed which was contaminated with detergents is totally removed. Then, we were supposed to start feeding the digester once again with new feedstock."
03,2021-06-01,24,How did you meet your energy needs befor,It was for one day.
03,2021-06-01,25,"I have noted that your biogas use manure, food waste and other waste - How did you manage your waste (the feedstock) before the reactor?","Before the digester were using electricity and firewood for cooking. For nsima we were using firewood, as for beans we were using electricity as it takes a longer time to get cooked."
03,2021-06-01,26,"Okay, how did the system work after commissioning?","Human waste is contained in the septic tank and is emptied when it is full, while food waste is disregarded in waste bins for disposal."
03,2021-06-01,27,Did they ever manage to get both stoves back to a level where you could cook with both stoves on?,"Initially, it worked perfectly well and we were able to use the two stoves we have at the same time. But, after two days, when we switched on both stoves we were not able to get the same level of heat, only one was heating up with the same intensity while the other couldn't really heat up. We reported to the installers because at the time they had not formally handed over the biogas. They came and suggested that we should use one pot at a time. When we used one, it was good. When we switched on both stoves only one pot could heat up to cook on."
03,2021-06-01,28,"So, what did they say?",No
03,2021-06-01,29,"Okay, how much gas was being produced?","They said little gas was being produced, but as time goes it was going to pick up as bacteria activity in the digester was going to increase with time and more gas was going to be."
03,2021-06-01,30,"Aside from cooking, how did you use the gas?",They didn't tell us the amount gas it was producing but we were able to cook 3 times a day.
03,2021-06-01,31,What were the operation requirements?,"Nothing else, it was simply for cooking."
03,2021-06-01,32,Why no plastic?,"They said we could use food waste and other biodegradable waste on top of, of course, human waste -- Any other waste excerpt plastic waste,"
03,2021-06-01,33,How did you prepare that feedstock?,Because plastic doesn't decompose and can't produce bacteria that produce gas.
03,2021-06-01,34,How much food waste and other waste were you feeding the digester on a daily basis?,Before feeding the digester with food waste we were breakdown food waste into small by smashing and remove things like stones and plastics.
03,2021-06-01,35,"On average, how much were you feeding the digester?",It was dependent on the amount of food leftover. Some days we were not feeding the digester.
03,2021-06-01,36,How much water were you adding to the feedstock?,I would say a 60 litre bucket of food waste a day.
03,2021-06-01,37,"You mentioned that a septic tank for prisoners' toilets is connected to the digester, who many prisoners were in the prison the time the biogas was working?",We were not adding water.
03,2021-06-01,38,That's like 500 people human waste was used by the system when it was in operation. Okay,"We had about 500 prisoners but now the number is less as some were released due to Covid to ease congestion. Now, we have about 200 prisoners."
03,2021-06-01,39,Did they talk about maintenance requirements?,Yes...
03,2021-06-01,40,What did they say?,"Yes, they did."
03,2021-06-01,41,You were trained how to do such things I believe.,"They said before the official handover everything that had to do with maintenance was there responsibility. But after handover, we were going to be responsible for maintenance. Besides that they said they were going to teach us more about maintenance after handover. Nonetheless, they talked about little things like how to replace valves, - Like when a valve malfunctions, we just need to buy and replace. They said before handover, we could do such kind of maintenance."
03,2021-06-01,42,"Before the digestor failed, did it meet your needs?","Yes, they showed us how to replace valves."
03,2021-06-01,43,How? What were the gaps?,It didn't.
03,2021-06-01,44,"You said you classified the food you cook into two groups, one which needs more heat, and one which needs less heat. The time you were using the digester what were you cooking it for?","We wanted it to work 100%. Unfortunately, we only managed to utilize it 50% as only one stove of the two functioned."
03,2021-06-01,45,What challenges were there?,We used to use the digester to cook food which needs more heat. It was faster.
03,2021-06-01,46,"After you used it for two days you could only use one stove, I would like to know, how long did it take to stop working completely?",The challenge was that we could only use two stoves at once. We noticed that when we were using two pots at once things couldn't get cooked and it was taking time for things to heat up. That's when they suggested using one stove at a time when both stoves couldn't heat up at the same time.
03,2021-06-01,47,After 4 months you stopped using both stoves completely?,We used it from November of last year to end February of this year. We only used it for about four months.
03,2021-06-01,48,It doesn't show any sign of working? Zero?,Yes...
03,2021-06-01,49,"You said you were trained about 15 of you on its operation and how to fix it, so once the biogas reactor broke, what did you do? Did you try to fix it?",It produces a little gas but you can't cook with it.
03,2021-06-01,50,When was that?,"We didn't do anything because we were never told that problem -- The issue was not part of the training. So, we were never told how to fix the problem. Therefore, we called them and they said the system was producing little gas and would come to fix it."
03,2021-06-01,51,Since March have they come to fix it?,Early March.
03,2021-06-01,52,Do you feel they will come?,"We have never gotten in touch since they said they were going to come to fix the digester. So, we are simply waiting for them to come and fix it."
03,2021-06-01,53,Did they tell you the cause?,"(Laughs) I'm not quite sure, but I still think they will come because they didn't handover the project."
03,2021-06-01,54,Have you seen something like this? What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?,No.
03,2021-06-01,55,We have done almost 80% of the interview. We are going towards the end. How would you describe the current state of the digester?,"I have never seen this before. But, I think the information would have helped solve the problem and would increase our knowledge on the subject of biogas."
03,2021-06-01,56,What makes you feel and say -- they didn't do something right that time.,"I can say it\`s 50 -- 50. It just needs little fixing so we can start using the biogas again. It needs a complete overhaul of the feed and then introduce new feed to get the bacteria back on track. In my opinion, I feel there is something they didn't do right that time. They just need to come and address that something. Like they said, the digester is producing little gas, and they said will come and assess the digester to rectify the problem."
03,2021-06-01,57,"In your opinion, what is the caused it to reach this state?","Because if they hadn't missed something we would have been able to cook with two stoves for some time. As I have said, it only took 2 days for one stove to stop functioning properly, so it shows there was a deficit on their part."
03,2021-06-01,58,"Okay, how do you manage your waste (feedstock) now that the reactor isn't working?","I believe what it caused it to reach this state is poor background in terms of installation as it didn't produce enough gas. Like I said, it didn't take long to stop working. It is also likely that there is a leakage somewhere. As you might observe, you can smell strange gas odor around the digester which shows that gas is escaping from the digester. So, you have a reactor which was producing small gas, and now some it's also leaking out gas. That's where we are now."
03,2021-06-01,59,"We are doing to the last sections, you have said you don't know how much money was spent, but it was funded by donors. Did Mulanje Prison contribute anything in kind?","We don't produce lots food leftovers as the population of prisoners was reduced to almost half due to Covid. They little waste we get we dispose in a refuse pit, and after some time we use it as manure in the garden. I believe if it starts working again we will be advised to put extra waste on top of human waste to cover food waste deficit caused by the depopulation of the prisoners."
03,2021-06-01,60,How many people were involved?,"There was nothing we contributed except for labor which cleared the site. As for digging, they came with an excavator which excavates the site. We also helped with labor which was responsible for carrying the materials."
03,2021-06-01,61,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,It was about 18 -- 25 people.
03,2021-06-01,62,"We are remaining with 3 questions. Okay, the time it was working did it save you money in terms of energy consumption?",They said they got the stoves from South Africa -- The biodigester bag was from South Africa. The other things were like cement and pipes were not imported.
03,2021-06-01,63,Like how much were you spending on electricity and firewood?,Yes
03,2021-06-01,64,"Oh impressive, what is your opinion of biogas?","Before biogas we were getting a bill of K500, 000 per month. But when it was installed we were spending about K300, 000 per month."
03,2021-06-01,65,"Last one, If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?",Biogas is good to use at an institution as well as at household level because it helps to protect environment. It is also important because it makes use of waste which we normally disregard to produce energy for cooking -- it's really a good thing.
03,2021-06-01,66, **Interviewer**: Why solar?,I would prefer solar.
03,2021-06-01,67,"When you say it uses local available resources, what do you have in mind?", **Interviewee**: Because it's cheap and it uses locally available resources so it's easy to maintain.
03,2021-06-01,68,This is the end of our interview. Thanks for your time.,"Solar panels, battery and invertors - such things are easily found here in Malawi. We have plenty of them in the hardware stores."
04,2021-06-02,1,Where did this digester originate?,Welcome. **[SMALL-SCALE BIOGAS DIGESTERS AS DEVELOPMENT AID: TALES OF HUBRIS AND FAILURE]{.underline}**
04,2021-06-02,2,Did they explicitly say it was a demo?,"It came from Water For People as a demonstration. They said they brought it here because this village was first village to become open defecation free in T/A Chapananga. They said we were doing well in terms of latrine construction and hygiene practices. So, as a token of appreciation they decided to build a biogas here, and that this was one of the many that was to come."
04,2021-06-02,3,"Tell me about the demonstration, how did it go?",Yes.
04,2021-06-02,4,Did you meet the white man?,After installation I remember calling them to inform about them that it was not producing biogas. They came and communicated that they were going to come again to fix the problem. But since that time they have never come again. And I heard their project phased out and the white man who was supporting them returned to his home.
04,2021-06-02,5,"(Laughs) you must have been very close. Okay, who designed it?","Yes, he used to come as a matter of fact, this chair I'm sitting on he is the one who gave me (Laughs)."
04,2021-06-02,6,Were people coming here to learn about the biogas?,"Aaaah, they didn't tell me who designed it. They just said they had finished similar interventions with other communities. And they went on to say, they wanted people from this community to learn from the initiative so that when they complete their project people should learn from me and replicate the same in their houses."
04,2021-06-02,7,Who funded it?,"No, it wasn't like people from the community were coming to my house to learn. I believe they just wanted people to admire so that they could adopt the same in their houses."
04,2021-06-02,8,"So, who built the digester? Was it people from this community or they brought people to build it?",I believe it came from water for people.
04,2021-06-02,9,How many were they?,They brought men who worked on it for three weeks.
04,2021-06-02,10,What was your role?,It was two guys. They stayed here with us during that time.
04,2021-06-02,11,How were you selected as a beneficiary?,I provided bricks and cattle manure which was used to initiate and boost the reactor before human waste was introduced into the reactor.
04,2021-06-02,12,"Before this intervention, did you know about biogas?","I was very much interested in WASH issues. And I was the first chief in T/A Chapananga to show interest in ensuring that people were constructing pit latrines to eliminate open defecation. This village was an exemplary village when it came to WASH issues, and even now it's still an exemplary village. So, that's why they decided to offer me the biogas to be the first demonstration site so that people would appreciate biogas technology."
04,2021-06-02,13,"Okay, take me through your introduction to biogas?","No, I didn't."
04,2021-06-02,14,"Honestly, I don't know how human waste can be turned into bricks. What did they say? How does it work?"," **Interviewee**: Before commencement of construction work, they told me that human manure can be used to produce energy for cooking and lighting. They also said human manure can be used to make bricks. So, they recommended biogas because it reduces misuse and reliance of trees for firewood."
04,2021-06-02,15,What were your expectations?,"They simply say there is a mechanism which turns human manure into bricks, but they didn't go into details."
04,2021-06-02,16,What else?,I expected to be able to cook without firewood (Laughs)
04,2021-06-02,17,"You have mentioned a number of things that biogas can do. For example, it can be used for lighting, cooking and making bricks. I want to know, what were you told to expect with it on your household?",Nothing else.
04,2021-06-02,18,Anything else?,I was told that I would have energy for cooking that I wouldn't need firewood for cooking.
04,2021-06-02,19,What kind of training were you given by the installers?,(Laughs) nothing else.
04,2021-06-02,20,"So, after installation you were told how it operates and how to operate it?","No, we didn't receive any training. I recall asking them to train members of chiefs committee on biogas or to take us to the communities where they have had similar projects to learn from them. They didn't heed our calls, so it didn't happen."
04,2021-06-02,21,"This is very important -- I want to know when they finished building the reactor, what did they say in terms of its operation?",Not a bit. They didn't train us on that. And I believe that's why it failed. It failed because they just installed it and didn't give us the expertise to operate it.
04,2021-06-02,22,Did they tell you to put water and all that?,That's where they failed us. We were expecting to have training. We even asked for it so that we could share the information with other people from the community...We had the whole community committee which was present throughout the construction process and we were all hoping that we were going to have training on biogas after installation instead they simply taught us how to open and close the gas.
04,2021-06-02,23,Did they show you?,"They said we should be adding water in the pit latrine, and also to feed the digester with manure, two -- 20L containers after every 2 to 4 days or so."
04,2021-06-02,24,How prepared to run operate the reactor did you feel you were?,They simply told us.
04,2021-06-02,25,How long did it work?,We were never able to use it.
04,2021-06-02,26,How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? (i.e. cook),"It could only produce fire for less than 2 minutes -- We never used it, we couldn't even boil water for bathing."
04,2021-06-02,27,"I have seen a number of goats around the house, how did you manage your waste (the feedstock) before the reactor?",We have trees around which we use as firewood.
04,2021-06-02,28,How did the system work after commissioning?,We were using it as manure and we are still using it as manure.
04,2021-06-02,29,How much gas was being produced?,"It never worked because when we tried to cook or boil water, water couldn't boil. Only a little flame was coming out and it wasn't enough to heat anything. Then, we called them; they just said they will come. Since then they have never returned."
04,2021-06-02,30,"So, how did you use the gas?",They didn't tell us. And whatever it was you couldn't cook anything with it.
04,2021-06-02,31,What were the operation requirements?,We were told that we could use the gas for cooking but we never used it not even for a single time -- It never worked.
04,2021-06-02,32,How many people were using the pit?,We were told to use cow dung first then add pig or goat manure on top of human waste which was connected to the digester through a pit latrine in order to have an active feed.
04,2021-06-02,33,What volume of other waste was you advised to feed the digester?,6 people.
04,2021-06-02,34,How much water did you add?,We were told to pit 2 buckets of 20 litres of manure after every 4 days.
04,2021-06-02,35,How did you prepare that feedstock?,2 buckets of 20 litres which translated to 40 litres of water.
04,2021-06-02,36,How much water?,"We asked to mix manure and water in the bucked the feed the digester, As for the pit latrine, we were told to put water in the pit latrine too."
04,2021-06-02,37,Who was responsible for feeding the digestor?,"A bucket after a week or so, I don't really remember."
04,2021-06-02,38,"Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?",The family was responsible for feeding the digestor.
04,2021-06-02,39,"They did tell you anything about maintenance, even the little about maintenance?","They said if it stopped working we should consult them to come and fix the digestor. It was them who were solely responsible for maintenance because we couldn't do anything because we knew nothing on how to fix it when it malfunctioned. That's why I asked them to train the community committee members so that they could sort problems when it malfunctioned, unfortunately, it never happened. We knew that if they could train us on little things it would help because it was impractical and tiresome for them to come and fix every single problem."
04,2021-06-02,40,You said the digester didn't meet your needs? How?,"No, they didn't."
04,2021-06-02,41,"So, taking all into consideration, what challenges did you encounter?","They said we could use the digester for cooking and after sometime we would be able to use it for lighting as gas production increases. Unfortunately, we were not even able to use it for cooking."
04,2021-06-02,42,Why do you feel someone left a stone in the pit and it caused it to block?,"As you have seen. The pit latrine is full and blocked because I believe someone disposed a stone in the pit. We are having challenges as can't manage to empty it that we have just locked it. Also, we feel the dome wasn't properly constructed because it has cracks which we believe gas escapes from. Besides that masonry work wasn't done properly because most of it collapsed after a very little time."
04,2021-06-02,43,"We are halfway through our interview, how long did you use it for before it stopped working?","Initially, when we were using the pit latrine effluent would rise at the outlet and the pit latrine content would depress. We used to collect and use the effluent as manure for farming purpose. But, after some time we saw that the pit content was not depressing, and we couldn't have effluent at the outlet. That's when we released that it had blocked."
04,2021-06-02,44,When was it built?,We used it from 2018 to 2020 -- from 2018 that's when we noticed the problems -- 2020 that's when it stopped completely
04,2021-06-02,45,Did it work?,2016
04,2021-06-02,46,"Oh, technically used never used the biogas for cooking, but for other things like collecting effluent for farming and as a toilet?",It worked in a sense that we were using the pit latrine as a toilet. As far as using it as an energy source for cooking were not able to do that from the onset.
04,2021-06-02,47,Did you ever try to fix it?,Exactly.
04,2021-06-02,48,When did you notice the cracks?,"When we saw that the dome had cracks, using our common sense, we thought we were not able to get enough gas for cooking because gas was escaping through the cracks. So, I hired a builder who tried to fix the cracks by lining it with cement but it didn't work, As for the pit latrine, we didn't do anything because we couldn't manage to reach the bottom to remove the stone to unblock it. Thus, we just left it, and that's why it is full and locked today."
04,2021-06-02,49,Like how long after they completed the work?," **Interviewee**: It was in 2016, it didn't take long after they had completed the work. That's when I first called them to inform them of the problem. They did come and saw the problem. Then, they just said they were going to come again to fix it. Since then they have never come back."
04,2021-06-02,50,"Okay, did you try to follow up after?",It was after 3 months.
04,2021-06-02,51,"I'm interested to know, when the people assessed the problem, what did they say was the problem? Or what was causing the problem?","The installers came to assess the problem and say they were going to return. I tried to follow up with their boss, a certain lady who used to come in a wrap-around cloth, \[name redacted\]. In the course of following up I learned she left Water For People for another organization. And that's when I stopped seeing Water For People. As for the white man, he was long gone to his countries, and I never saw him again after he gave me this chair."
04,2021-06-02,52,Have you seen something like this (Shown a table intervention)? What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?,"They didn't say what the problem was. They just made it look like a simple problem. But, we released that it was a bigger problem than they made it look. And, we released that they couldn't fix the problem as it was beyond their expertise, because if it was something they could have managed to fix I'm sure they would have come and solve the problem. And I'm sure when they saw the problem, in their hearts, they knew they couldn't fix it, and that's why they never came back."
04,2021-06-02,53,We have done almost 80% of the interview; we are going towards the end. How would you describe the current state of the digester?,"It would have helped us because it would have guided us on how to solve same of the problems. For example, when they told me how much feed I was supposed to load, I was loading the feedstock as I was told. In the same manner, I would have been following what the table was recommending."
04,2021-06-02,54,"In your opinion, what is the caused it to reach this state?",The digestor is not functioning -- it's completely dead.
04,2021-06-02,55,"Okay, what else?","It failed because we were not provided with enough information and skills on how to operate and maintain it. In this community we have village committees, health committee which if were provided with expertise on biogas, I'm sure would have managed to maintain it."
04,2021-06-02,56,"Okay, you said they constructed the digester for 2/3 weeks, and after they finished the work they saw that you couldn't use it for cooking and it was not producing gas. I would like to know, when they were leaving, what did they say? What happened?","I can say the digestor was not constructed the way it is supposed to be constructed. You can tell this by the simple fact that it never worked from the onset. Imagine, we never used it for cooking."
04,2021-06-02,57,"(Laughs) okay, the digester is not working, what are you using for energy i.e. cooking?","We had no previous experience with biogas so when we saw a little gas and also told that after some time more gas was going to be produced, we were convinced that at some point we were going to use to have more gas and eventually use it for cooking. (Laughs)"
04,2021-06-02,58,How do you manage your waste (feedstock) now that the reactor isn't working?,We are currently using firewood and charcoal.
04,2021-06-02,59,It works okay?,we are using manure as fertilizer for farming purposes.
04,2021-06-02,60,"You said it was funded by water for people, by any chance, do you know how much money was involved?",It works perfectly. And this year we are going to have a dumper yield than previous years.
04,2021-06-02,61,You said you provided bricks and manure. What else did you contribute anything in kind?,"No, they didn't tell me."
04,2021-06-02,62,What you contributed was it voluntary or mandatory?,Only that -- Cement and everything else was provided for by Water For People.
04,2021-06-02,63,What do you think could have happened if you failed to contribute such things?,I was told to contribute those things so that they could start.
04,2021-06-02,64,"(Laughs) and being a chief too you wouldn't have struggle to siource such things, I guess. How much did it cost you to acquire the bricks?","I don't know. They simply told me to contribute such things, and fact that I was interested to have the digester, I contributed without hesitation. Plus, manure wasn't a problem for me since I raise cattle and goats."
04,2021-06-02,65,How much labor was involved in terms of digging?,It was provided for by someone from the community.
04,2021-06-02,66,For how long?,They hired 3 people to do the digging work.
04,2021-06-02,67,Masonry**?**,They worked for 4 days.
04,2021-06-02,68,For how long?,It was 2 people who came from Water For People.
04,2021-06-02,69,Was there any other work which was done?,2 weeks
04,2021-06-02,70,How many were involved in this task?,"Yes, people were hired to collect water soaking stones which they used for the outlets -- The one I showed you. They said we needed those stones so that we would be able to harvest dry manure as the stones soak up water from the output."
04,2021-06-02,71,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,"It was the same 3 people, and they took some hour to do the work."
04,2021-06-02,72,They didn't say anything was sourced from outside the country?,Nothing.
04,2021-06-02,73,Did it save you money in terms of energy consumption or anything? Did it help you in anyway?,"No, they didn't."
04,2021-06-02,74,"We are going towards the end, we remaining with 2 questions. What is your opinion of biogas?","No, it never worked so it didn't help use in terms of cooking. The only thing that was positive was that they built a pit latrine which was connected to the digester that we manage to use for some time."
04,2021-06-02,75,What fascinated you about biogas?,"Biogas is a good thing -- It is something I was interest in and I'm still interested in. That's why when my wife told me you came; I was very much interested in your visit because I hoping that at the end of the day you will be able to rejuvenate the digester so that I can at least use it. Recently, I planned to dismantle the whole thing including the toilet because at the moment I don't have a toilet since it got full."
04,2021-06-02,76,"Last one, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?","The fact that we can use human manure which many see as waste to produce energy for cooking and lighting is very interesting. Also, the fact that, we you can use it for cooking without using firewood and charcoal is very significant in terms of curbing deforestation in the community."
04,2021-06-02,77,(Laughs) this is the end of our interview. Thanks a lot the interview.,"I don't know any energy intervention that can use human waste to produce energy for lighting and cooking, so I'm limited of choices."
