01,2021-05-31,1,"Okay, where did the digester originate?","It came from a certain company in Blantyre, Chileka"
01,2021-05-31,2,"Okay, who designed the digester?",It was them -- We just bought them the digestor and they build and installed it too.
01,2021-05-31,3,"Okay, what was the price?","We bought it at K190, 000. On top of that, there were some other cost like transport, manure and all that which made it K228, 000. And there is also another K48, 000 which I haven't paid. So roughly, it's K270, 000."
01,2021-05-31,4,How did you know about biogas?,"I came to know biogas through a friend. She is very interested in biogas, and she lives within the community, just after the transformer area. She went to Blantyre to meet with the guys I bought the digester from, when she came back, she told me about the meeting and biogas. Then, I became very interested too."
01,2021-05-31,5,What interested you?,The fact that you can use waste for cooking and lighting.
01,2021-05-31,6,What were your expectations?,"Mmmh, our expectation is that we are going to be able to use biogas for cooking. We hope to reduce cooking problems as well as health problems my wife usually suffers. She suffers from respiratory diseases when she cooks using firewood. Also, we expect to stop using firewood completely due to environmental concern. On top of that, we are very much into farming and we produce more manure, and we want to expand so we hope to be able to produce even more manure and biogas for cooking"
01,2021-05-31,7,"Okay, what were you told to expect from the installer?","We were told that we can use the biogas for cooking, lighting and also to generate electricity which we can use for hours but to do that we need a generator which turn biogas into electricity. All you do is, you put fuel in the generator then modify the generator by connecting it to a carburettor. Some people are even using this method for irrigation - That's where we are going, and we will get there."
01,2021-05-31,8,How did you know this? I mean this is so technical.,"I was interested to know more about biogas so I inquired more from the supplier. The other thing about biogas is that it's a source of manure. When the feedstock decomposes it produces effluent which can be used as manure, or can be sold. I'm sure I will get to that level once I move to my own compound where I will do things with a bit of freedom and flexibility."
01,2021-05-31,9,"Okay, what kind of training were you given by the installers?","No, but I'm a person who can easily understand things. So, whatever he said I was able to grasp and comprehend what he was saying. He talked about its operation -- if it does this do that. So, that was the type of training I received. Secondly, all the information regarding biogas in on the internet, on YouTube we are able to see and learn ourselves. For example, me and my friend we have been on internet browsing and sharing these things. So to me that's enough training, and I don't think I need any other type of training. As a matter of fact, I can purchase and confidently install and run a biogas system."
01,2021-05-31,10,Why did you choose to have one built here?,We wanted to make life easier for us in terms of cooking. As you can see we have lots of chicken so we want to use the manure to produce energy for cooking.
01,2021-05-31,11,How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? (I.e. cook),"We were using firewood, and sometimes we were using briskets and charcoal. It's mostly firewood though**.** And It\`s sad because such means damage the environment."
01,2021-05-31,12,How did you manage your waste (the feedstock) before the reactor?,We used animal waste as manure in the garden and some of it we just throw away.
01,2021-05-31,13,"You said you just tried it out, and have never utilised it fully. So, how did the system work after installation?","Unfortunately, we don't have a mechanism to measure the gas that was produced. However, we tried to cook on it, and we were excited that we were able to cook something with it. And that was what we wanted to see (Laughs)"
01,2021-05-31,14,(Laughs) what did you cook?,"We cooked a side dish. But, before that we boiled water. And considering that we didn't load adequate feedstock, we were convinced with its output."
01,2021-05-31,15,Where were the operation requirements?,"Initially, we were supposed to feed the digester with cow dung. They installer explained that first feed needed to be cow dung because it's a ruminant and that its dung has a high bacterial load crucial to initiate the system. Thereafter, we could use any other type of manure e.g. goat, chicken and pig manure. However, we have not used it for some months now, so I have asked a certain person to bring me cow manure tomorrow to kick-start it again."
01,2021-05-31,16,"So, manure is the core operation requirement. Okay, what else?",Definitely.
01,2021-05-31,17,How did you prepare that feedstock?,"You put dung in a bucket and add water. Actually, you use fresh dung and not dry dung for this purpose. Then, you mix the mixture till it reached a level it can be easily poured from the bucket. Essentially, we add 5 buckets of water to 5 buckets of manure. We were told to feed 5 buckets of 25 Litres."
01,2021-05-31,18,What were the maintenance requirements?,"There is little maintenance that required. You need to check the frame on the stove. Also, you need to constantly monitor gas pressure in the digester to detect leakages. So, we are required to check these things time and again to ensure that it keeps on working."
01,2021-05-31,19,Who is responsible for feeding the digestor?,"This is a household so we are supposed to feed the digester. Their responsibility was to install the digester which they are only remaining with building a green house, after that everything else is our responsibility."
01,2021-05-31,20,What challenges have you encountered so far?,"The only challenge we have encountered was when we mounted the digester in a cage. The pressure was very high that it was breaking the cage time and again. So, we were reporting to the installers time and again about the problem and it was a annoying thing to do. So they came and decided that the cages containing the bags should be placed underground to resist the pressure. After, that did that we have not had any problem with the digester."
01,2021-05-31,21,"Oh, pressure was breaking metal cage?","Yes, it's not any ordinary pressure. It\`s high pressure that heats up the bag and inflated to a point you think it's about to burst."
01,2021-05-31,22,"You have never used, excerpt the time you tried it?","It's not long since I tried it. It's been a month or two. I haven't been able to finish the project because I'm also doing a house project somewhere. So, yes, that's the only time it ever worked and I ever tried it."
01,2021-05-31,23,"Once the digester started to break the cage, did you try to fix it? What did you do?","That's when I called the installer, and he suggested that in my case the digester bag was supposed to be buried in the ground. And since then we haven't had the problem."
01,2021-05-31,24,"Now that it's not working, you said you are using firewood?","Yes, we can't say we stopped using firewood. We are still using firewood and charcoal. But if he comes with the manure tomorrow we are going to keep it up and we hope to stop using firewood. Also, I'm hoping to buy cement any day from now because I want to build a floor for the stalls so that I will be able to harvest enough and quality dung for the digester."
01,2021-05-31,25,How much labour do you think went into building this in terms of digging?,"It was about four people because they wanted to do it within 2 hours. But, I believe even one person would have managed to do it but would have taken a day or two."
01,2021-05-31,26,Masonry?,It was one person.
01,2021-05-31,27,Was there any other work?,"Yes, fabrication which was done by one person."
01,2021-05-31,28,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,"The biodigester is not from Malawi because they tried to liaise with local companies to supply them with the biodigester, but it has not worked."
01,2021-05-31,29,What is your opinion of biogas?,"Biogas is a good thing but it has taken time to reach Malawi. Otherwise, we need more people to learn about biogas because it will improve the livelihood of many people in the urban and rural community. Also, I believe has the potential of reducing deforestation, I know we can't completely stop using firewood, but biogas can reduce firewood use drastically."
01,2021-05-31,30,"If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?","People are using solar, and I think is a good alternative of biogas because it reduces misuse of trees. And people are using solar in doing great things in Malawi, you talk of irrigation. Also, I think here in Africa solar is the way to go because we are naturally blessed with the sun, so let's use that opportunity to produce energy."
01,2021-05-31,31,"Thanks for the interview, I truly appreciate.",NA
02,2021-05-31,1,"Okay, where did the digester originate?","It came with students from Chancellor College, together with \[name redacted\]."
02,2021-05-31,2,I presume the students were whites?,"Yes, it was \[name redacted\] and his colleagues. I don't remember the names of the others. What they said was that all of them were from Sweden, but from different parts of Sweden. For example here in Malawi, we can say some were from Mzuzu, Zomba, and Blantyre -- But, all the three students were from Sweden."
02,2021-05-31,3,"Okay, who designed the digester?",It was them -- the whites.
02,2021-05-31,4,"Okay, why do you say that?",It was them who were mostly involved in the installation work with little assistance from \[name redacted\].
02,2021-05-31,5,"Okay, who provided money for the digester to be built here?","Ahh, I am not quite sure -- What I saw was them bringing bricks and cement, so I couldn't tell where they got the money, and who was paying for the materials and equipment. My only role was to provide land and water for construction of the system. Also, I identified two boys who assisted with construction work."
02,2021-05-31,6,"So, you paid the boys?","No, the boys were not paid. What \[name redacted\] did was, he thanked them at the end with touch devices with phone battery charging capabilities for their involvement. For the reason that in some instances the boys would excuse themselves to go charge phones at phone charging centers."
02,2021-05-31,7,"Okay, it was the 2 boys who built it... I mean who built it?","Ahh, No, I can't say it was the 2 boys. The two boys were involved in digging work as well as helping with other work like mixing of mortar. The other work like installation of equipment was done by the whites and \[name redacted\] because the local boys didn't have the expertise to do that."
02,2021-05-31,8,"Okay great...... Umhu, clearly there are many households and people within this community, so how were you selected as a beneficiary out of the many?","Aaaah, I believe they got my name from LEAD Malawi or from the forestry department because I have worked with these institutions for quite a long time. Yet, I'm not really sure about it. And when they came to me, it did not cross my mind to ask how and why I was selected as a beneficiary because I was very excited about the thought of having a new things which I could use for cooking -- So I didn't care about enquiring anything because of the excitement (Laughs) -- It was just like Manna from Heaven for me! (Laughs)"
02,2021-05-31,9,(Laughs) what made you think that it was LEAD Malawi or the Forestry Department that connected you with \[name redacted\] and his team?,"Mmmh okay, it's because if you look at the biogas digester, it's a technology that when in use protects the environment because it eliminates the use of firewood. Thus, LEAD Malawi and forestry department being organisations whose objective is to protecting the environment, and me being a volunteer of Forest department and a secretary of their community group since 2006 made me believe that is why they chose me to be a beneficiary."
02,2021-05-31,10,"Okay! Before \[name redacted\] and his team came to you, did you know about biogas?","Yes, I learnt that manure can be used to produce energy for cooking and lighting. I learnt this in school - It was just theory, and not practical. This was back in 1996 when I was in Standard 8. Yet, my first experience with the technology was when \[name redacted\] []{.mark}came with news that they were coming to install the technology, and eventually they installed the technology on my backward. Thus, I saw it as an opportunity to learn more about the technology, and I was excited to use the technology. Unfortunately, I was unable to use the technology as I expected."
02,2021-05-31,11,What were your expectations?,"From the knowledge I had, my expectation was that I was going to use the technology for cooking. I expected that everything that I would eat that needed cooking I was going to use the technology. This explains why I was willing to find people to assist them with the work. It also explains why I even supplied them with piped water which is paid for, instead of simply collecting water from the borehole which is far from this house and free. I was very excited because at the end of project, I was going to own the technology."
02,2021-05-31,12,"(Laughs) Okay! Okay! When \[name redacted\] and his colleagues came, what were you told to expect?","Initially, he simply came to inform me that he was going to come with students from Chanco to do practicals on biogas, and that they had selected me as a beneficiary of that project."
02,2021-05-31,13,Did he mention what the selection process was like?,"Ahh, he didn't explain anything pertaining to that. He just said they had selected me as a beneficiary on the biogas project. Personally, it wasn't surprising because they were not the first people to come and work with me under such circumstances. Many people and organisations approach me to work with, just like you have done - They simply explain their agenda; we talk and then take off from there. So, I didn't ask many questions, and I suspected that they were referred to me by the Forestry department -- just like I said. I do Agroforestry work with Forest department."
02,2021-05-31,14,"You have said from previous knowledge you expected to use biogas for cooking, I want to know, what were you told to expect from the technology by \[name redacted\] and his team?","I was told that I could use the technology for cooking, and after installation the system was producing gas, and as a matter of fact, when they were leaving they tested it by boiling water, and it worked. It took like the time you been here (10 minutes) for the water to heat up and boil."
02,2021-05-31,15,Oh great! So how long did it take to cease working?,"It never really worked. Actually, for the digester to work and produce gas someone had to squeeze and release the gas pipe to force it to produce enough gas and pressure for cooking. They said the stove was no the recommended for the system, that's why it was not producing enough gas and pressure.... If one didn't press and release the gas pipe, one couldn't cook or boil anything with it because the heat that was being produced was very low."
02,2021-05-31,16,"Okay, what kind of training were you given by the installers?","No, I was not trained in any way."
02,2021-05-31,17,Zero?,Yes.
02,2021-05-31,18,Ooh?,"Yes, they only demonstrated to me how to prepare the feedstock. I was told how to mix and stir manure and cover manure in a bucket. Then after three day I was told to put feedstock in the digester. Accordingly, the same way they showed me how to mix feedstock, I was doing it. I didn't for some time. After some time I stop it. What really made me stop and eventually stop using the digester was the fact that I had to press and release the gas pipe during cooking. It was more less like I was doing two things at once. When I was cooking, instead of leaving the pot on the fire to do other things, I was going outside the kitchen to press and release the gas pipe -- you see that! -- If I weren't pressing and releasing the gas pipe, I couldn't get fire."
02,2021-05-31,19,"So, we can say you were trained how to prepare the feedstock, and how to produce more gas and heat under the then conditions. What else were you trained?",There was nothing else!
02,2021-05-31,20,"Okay, so after you were trained how to prepare feedstock, how prepared to run operate the reactor did you feel you were?","Because I had no prior experience with the technology, I felt that what they had taught me was enough to run the system. But when I look back - if it was now, and someone come and teach me how to prepare feedstock and everything else they told me, I would say it's not enough to operate the reactor because certain people taught me that and it wasn't enough. It didn't work!"
02,2021-05-31,21,"From what I have heard, you did not you choose to build a digester? /have one built here; it was \[name redacted\] and his team who brought it here on their own accord.....","Ummhu, Yes, he chose to build it here because he wanted his students to do practicals. But, I can't say that's why it failed to work. It failed to work because they didn't have enough equipment. For example, the stove, if the stove was available and producing gas and fire, I would have been more interested to use the technology, and eventually it wouldn't have failed -- It failed because it didn't work properly in the first place. Then, that's when I decided to remove the stove and pipes, after I got fed up with technology."
02,2021-05-31,22,"Okay, how did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? (i.e. cook)",I was using firewood for cooking.
02,2021-05-31,23,"Okay...... Apart from firewood, what else were you meeting your energy needs?",There was nothing else I was using aside from firewood.
02,2021-05-31,24,Where were you getting firewood for cooking?,"From the mountain. Plus, we have lots of trees around the compound. We also have a woodlot within. That one you see, that's ours."
02,2021-05-31,25,"I remember you mentioned that you were using manure to run the digester, where were you getting the manure?",They brought the first manure in two black containers; I guess they were 250L containers.
02,2021-05-31,26,Did you use your own manure at some point?,"Yes, I did after they had left."
02,2021-05-31,27,"Okay, before the reactor, how did you manage your manure waste?","I had pits where I was dumping the dung. After sometime, I was collecting the dung, and use it as fertilizer at my farm."
02,2021-05-31,28,"Okay sure. After everything was done, how did the system work?","As far as I'm concerned, it didn't work well. If it had worked well after commissioning, I'm sure you would have found it working today or else recently broken. Nonetheless, on their part it worked well because I believe they wanted to see if manure can produce energy for cooking, and it did. So, to them it was a success. And even myself, I can testify that manure really produce energy for cooking because I saw it too. All in all, it didn't assist me in anyway because it never worked since it did not produce energy for cooking because the stove was not compatible with the system -- That's what they told me. Because I asked what the problem was, they said the problem was certainly the stove. They said they needed to buy the stove from Kenya, and once they replace the stove things would change. But, since then they have never returned."
02,2021-05-31,29,So they said they couldn't get the stove here in Malawi but in Kenya.,"Yes, that's what they told me."
02,2021-05-31,30,"And they said they were going to bring the stove and install it, and finalize everything?",Yes
02,2021-05-31,31,Did they tell you how long it was going to take them to buy and bring the stove here in Malawi?,"Mhhh, they never said it, and I didn't ask because I was certain that they were going to bring it, and it wouldn't take a very long time."
02,2021-05-31,32," **Interviewer**: That was 2014, and now we are in 2021. Why do you think they didn't bring and install the stove?","Like I said, they got what they wanted. They wanted to see if manure can produce energy. Their objective was not for me to possess and use the biogas system. If their objective was for me to use biogas, I'm sure they would have brought the stoves in the first place or bought the stove by now."
02,2021-05-31,33,"(Laughs) Let me put it to you, there are many people who they could have chosen to build the biogas on their premise, or worse still they could have done their practicals everywhere else even at Chanco, why do you think they bothered to come here?",(Laughs) I don't really know. Only \[name redacted\] knows. It could also be because I was well known to have many cows around the community. It could also be because of my affiliation with LEAD and Forest department.
02,2021-05-31,34,(Laughs) what makes you think they got to you because you had many cattle?,"Biogas needs manure to run so because they saw that I had lots cattle, they knew that I might be able to run it, unlike someone without cattle."
02,2021-05-31,35,"Okay**,** how much gas was being produced?","I wasn't taught. Also, to know how much gas was being produced, it would mean I had measuring equipment. And I wasn't exposed to the measuring equipment and any other technical aspects, but they had measuring equipment and they were testing things all the time and I'm sure they must have recorded how much gas was being produced."
02,2021-05-31,36,And you weren't told how much gas it was producing?,Yes.
02,2021-05-31,37,"Let try to measure it may be by using simple methods. How long were you using it in terms cooking? Let's say how many meals, how much long would it take to boil water?",I never really used it because I couldn't be doing two things at once. I never used it.
02,2021-05-31,38,"You said you were using manure, what were other operation requirements?",They just talked about manure and that was what they used to produce gas. I didn't see them bringing any other material **-** No! Excerpt other equipment and pipes which gas was circulating in. So basically manure was used to operate the biogas system.
02,2021-05-31,39,"Okay, how much manure was needed to operate?","No, I wasn't told how much manure would be required. I was just told to mix manure and water then stir and cover. After sometime to stir and cover again and so on, for three days. Then after that, I was supposed to put the feedstock into the three bags through inlets made of the blue standing pipes."
02,2021-05-31,40,How much feedstock were you putting after three days?,"As you have seen, there are three inlets so I was supposed to put a 16 Litre bucket of manure in each inlet after every three days. And when the inlets where full, there was an outlet which was overflowing so you knew the bags were full."
02,2021-05-31,41,"Oh, if you put 16 litres, there was no overflow?","No, there was already manure in the digester bags so I was simply refilling manure that was already in the bags. Thus, sometimes I could feed less than 16 Litres and it would overflow."
02,2021-05-31,42,"Oh, I understand. How did you know that the feedstock was ready after three day?","Like I said, I was simply gathering manure in a bucket then I was adding water and stir. We stirred the mix to breakdown manure to a level where there were no lumps. But, even when I saw that it was broken down perfectly and it was smooth, but if it wasn't after three days I could not feed the digester because I was told to feed the digester with manure after three days."
02,2021-05-31,43,"Let me see if I have got you correctly. You had three 16 litre buckets, you were mixing manure with water, stir and cover for three days. After three day that's when you were feeding the digester.","Ummhu, Spot on."
02,2021-05-31,44,"Okay, why after 3 days?",That's when manure is matured and ready to produce gas.
02,2021-05-31,45,"Okay, how much water did you add?","I can't say I was adding a specific amount of water then I would be lying. But it was more manure than water. I wasn't measuring the mixture, and I didn't saw \[name redacted\] and his team mixing a specific amount of manure with water, and I don't think they had a specific amount of mixture for manure and water. They simply told me to add water to the manure."
02,2021-05-31,46,Ummhu...,"I was told to have a mixture where I could be able to stir but I wasn't told the exact amount of water I was supposed add to the manure. In most cases though, it was half water and half manure. That was enough to have a proper mixture where I could manage to stir in a 16 litre bucket."
02,2021-05-31,47,"Okay, who was responsible for feeding the digestor?",It was only me as the owner of the house.
02,2021-05-31,48,Was there a time you ran out of manure?,"No! No! I had plenty of cattle, goats and pigs then. There was no shortage of manure. Maybe, in the future I could have run out of manure, but it never occurred. The time I abandoned the biogas, I had plenty of manure because I was keeping manure for this purpose rather than piling manure in a pit for manure."
02,2021-05-31,49,"Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?","They did not talk about maintenance. The last encounter we had they simply said they were not done with the work and they were going to come back to install the stove and finalize the work in a little while. As a result, I had no opportunity to ask how I could fix the biogas or anything if anything went wrong because I thought they were coming to finalize everything in a short time. I believed then that was the right time to ask about maintenance issues and anything else."
02,2021-05-31,50,(Laughs) you though they were not done? .................,"To me they were not done, but they were done in their sight because they had seen manure producing gas and fire. So, to me the work wasn't done because they had not installed the stove which they promised to install. Even the time they were leaving they didn't carry all their materials. For instance, they left three buckets and one drum so I was sure they were coming back as they said."
02,2021-05-31,51,"Okay, did it meet your needs?","No, far from it. No even a quarter (Laughs)"
02,2021-05-31,52,(Laughs) not even a quarter?,"(Laughs) Yes, not even a quarter."
02,2021-05-31,53,Why do you say that?,"I didn't manage to use. Once you open the gas and start cooking, nothing could boil. Only a small volume of water would warm up. Unless you press and release the gas pipe continuously to allow gas to flow, then things could boil. It was very tiresome and discouraging."
02,2021-05-31,54,"If you press and release the gas pipe continuously, things could boil and get cooked perfectly?",Yes.
02,2021-05-31,55,"Okay, why didn't you just seal pipe to allow gas to flow through the pipes?","No, you couldn't do that because it would block the flow of gas. It wasn't like gas was leaking from the pipe. Alternatively, I could step and release on the digester bags because they were in the open, and when I did that enough gas was produced to cook on**.**"
02,2021-05-31,56,Who told you that?,They told me.
02,2021-05-31,57,"Okay, what challenges were there?","Aaaah, I didn't nit have any other problem besides that."
02,2021-05-31,58,No other challenges?,Yes.
02,2021-05-31,59,"How long did you use it for before it stopped working? Like when did you stop pressing and releasing the gas pipe, and say I'm not using this anymore?",It didn't last 5 months. It must be 4 months from the day they departed.
02,2021-05-31,60,"So, in those 4 months, there was never a point where you could cook without pressing and releasing the gas pipe or step on the digester bags?","No, there was never a time it worked without doing that. So after 4 months, I kept everything intact, the pipes and the installation, for 2 more years hoping that one day they were going to come. After 2 years that's when I gave up completely that they were not coming back to install the stove."
02,2021-05-31,61,Did you try to fix it on your own?,"No, there was nothing I could do. Imagine if the experts and the owners couldn't fix it, couldn't manage to have the digester produce enough gas for cooking, it was obvious that I couldn't fix it. Only if they had left it working properly, and told me what to do when gas was coming of short then maybe I could have tried to fix it."
02,2021-05-31,62,Did they leave their contacts so that you could call them?,"I'm not sure..... Oh, yes, I had their numbers"
02,2021-05-31,63,Why didn't you call them?,"I wasn't supposed to call them. They were the ones who chose me as a beneficiary so in the same spirit they should have ensured that everything was okay before handing me the digester - what was the problem? I couldn't call them like I was asking them to repay back a loan, calling them would have seemed like they owed me a loan. It was them who were supposed to be in the forefront to ensure that everything was okay. If they couldn't get me on the phone, they knew my house so they could have come if they were serious. Then after all that, I realized that they didn't bring the biogas for me to use, but it for them to do their practicals. That's why when they saw that it produced gas they didn't even bother to come back. They simply wanted a household to do their practicals and they got one -- \[my\] house,"
02,2021-05-31,64,Have you seen something like this this?,No.
02,2021-05-31,65,Let's suppose you were given something like that. Do you think it would have helped you? And what do you think about this kind of information?,"It's helpful, because I can know how to read so I would use it to solve problems regarding biogas defects. However, in my case, like I mentioned, it wouldn't have helped because they left the problem and told me that a stove would solve the problem. The solution for this digester was a recommended stove for the digester."
02,2021-05-31,66,How would you describe the current state of the digester?,"There is no digester. Can you say you have seen a digester? There is none -- but I know I had a digester at some point. We had people who worked on the digester, including men I sourced who assisted them with the work, and had I know that time that they were here for practicals I wouldn't have bothered to source them to assist them. I would have just let them hire men to help them. Without the men sourced, they wouldn't have completed the work because if the boys were not present they were not doing anything -- they were so dependent on the boys I sourced. They were even waiting for them to come to start their work -- can white people dig? No (Laugh) you see that."
02,2021-05-31,67,"To cut the long story short, how did it reach this state? In your opinion, what is the cause?","The digestor was not producing enough gas that's why I abandoned it. If it were producing enough gas, I wouldn't have abandoned it because I was very much interested in biogas. What pulled me off was the fact that I had to keep pressing and releasing so that I could cook. So it was time consuming, and it couldn't allow me to do other things while I was cooking.... But, I know he's around, because he never bothered to call or anything that's why he didn't want come after he left."
02,2021-05-31,68,What do you do for energy now that the reactor isn't working?,I use firewood.
02,2021-05-31,69,From the forest?,There is not much wood in the forest. I just use firewood from trees within the compound.
02,2021-05-31,70,Has there been a time you have run out of wood?,"No, I have enough trees around."
02,2021-05-31,71,"You said you were using cow, goat and sheep manure, How do you manage your such waste now that the reactor isn't working?","I don't have cattle, goats and pigs as I used to. The little I have I collect and put it a pit, then later use it as manure."
02,2021-05-31,72,How much did the reactor cost to build?,"I going to lie. I don't know where they were getting the bricks; I didn't know the price of cement, pipes and everything. I only know the bill of the water they used, and had I know they cane to do practical I would have asked them to pay the bill -- What they did is pure impertinence!"
02,2021-05-31,73,What was the bill?,I don't know the actual amount. And didn't care much because I was very excited to own a biogas and I knew the benefits of using the biogas for cooking were going to outweigh the cost of water bill.
02,2021-05-31,74,How much labor do you think went into building digging?,Two people -- It was \[name redacted\] and \[name redacted\].
02,2021-05-31,75,Masonry,"The two, together with \[name redacted\]"
02,2021-05-31,76,In total we can say it took 6 people to do the work?,"Yes, it was basically 6 people, however, in some instance they would call me to help as well."
02,2021-05-31,77,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,I don't know anything.
02,2021-05-31,78,Maybe the stoves.,"Yes, that's what they told me."
02,2021-05-31,79,Did the reactor save you money in terms of energy consumption?,It didn't save me money because I rarely used it. I used it when I felt like I was not in a rush and had no other things to do. That's when I would go press and release the gas pipe. I did that for 4 months hoping they would come one day but they never came.
02,2021-05-31,80,We are going towards the end of our interview. We are remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas?,Biogas is a good is a thing because when you are using it you don't need firewood in the process protecting the environment.
02,2021-05-31,81,What else from that?,"Also, it's important because it makes use of manure which in most cases is left unattended, and useless. So you can say I was killing two birds with one stone. I was able to sell milk from the cattle and at the same time I was using manure to produce energy for cooking. To cut the long story short, biogas is a good thing, and if in Malawi we could have at least 10 people in every district using biogas, we are going to protect and rejuvenate the environment because people would stop using firewood."
02,2021-05-31,82,"Last one. If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?","I don't think there is no other alternative. The only alternative is electricity which requires more money. You can't trade biogas with solar because solar requires very powerful and expensive panels to use for cooking. I have a solar system, but I can't use it for cooking. So, I would say I can't choose anything else other than biogas itself."
02,2021-05-31,83,"Thanks for the interview, I truly appreciate.",NA
03,2021-06-01,1,Where did this digester originate?,It was brought here by contractors.
03,2021-06-01,2,What is name of the contractor?,It wasn't like it was a company or an organization. It was two individuals. \[name redacted\] and some guy - I have forgotten the other. They are well known across the country for building biogas system-- they have just started though.
03,2021-06-01,3,Is it the same guy who built the one at Mangochi Prison? I think I saw on YouTube his Mangochi Prison work.,"Yes, he said so."
03,2021-06-01,4,Who designed it?,It was the same people.
03,2021-06-01,5,"Okay, who funded it?",It was a project of United Purpose done in conjunction with European Union.
03,2021-06-01,6,"I have seen structures there, the green house and other things, who built that digester?",It was the same two guys who brought the digester.
03,2021-06-01,7,"So at Mulanje Prison, what was your role?",It was funded by donors so our role was to provide guidance on aspects related to this premise.
03,2021-06-01,8,Could you please elaborate on that?,We provide guidance as to where the digester was supposed to be built talking into future developmental plans as well as security of the prison.
03,2021-06-01,9,"We have many prisons in Malawi, if we go to Chikwawa we will find one, if we go to Blantyre we will find one. So, how were you selected as a beneficiary?","We used to have problems with electricity and cooking equipment that we were forced to cut down tree for firewood within Mulanje mountain which was damaging the environment drastically. As such were prioritized to protect trees from Mulanje Mountain, so I believe that's why we were prioritized among other prisons in Malawi."
03,2021-06-01,10,"Before this intervention, did you know about biogas?","No, we didn't."
03,2021-06-01,11,Looking at the selection process was it like they looked at all the prisons or what was the selection process like?,"I can't really know, but I believe there were high level discussions. All I know we were partners with United Purpose so they were supporting Mulanje Prison unlike other prisons. So I believe that's why they decided to choose Mulanje prison to be a beneficiary."
03,2021-06-01,12,What were your expectations?,"We had high expectations as I told you we were having cooking problems so we expected to solve this problem. Also, we were very much involved in cutting down of tree for firewood. So, we hoped to reduce firewood use which contributes to deforestation and environmental degradation. On top of that, we expected to drastically reduce use of electricity which was going to help reduce electricity bills."
03,2021-06-01,13,What were you told to expect?,"We were told that the system would help us reduce cooking time as it produces hot flames. We were also told that the system is very durable with a long life span, long as we avoid introducing chemicals or detergents into the digester. To do that we were told to close all valves so that no chemical would go into the system. Also, if we used detergents, we were required to close down the system for at least 3 days so that detergents would flush out the system. They also said with the coming in of the digester we were going to be in a better position to cook more food at once as the stoves were bigger than the ones which we were using with electricity. And lastly they said it's easily to maintain."
03,2021-06-01,14,Why did they say chemicals and detergents should not be allowed into the system?,They said digesters heavily rely on bacterial activity so introduction of chemicals would kill bacteria and eventually shut the system.
03,2021-06-01,15,Why did they say it's easy to maintain?,"They said the pipes which were installed do not easily get punctured because gas which passes through the pipes does get hot that it damages the pipes. On top of that, they said once the system was installed there are less operation requirements. All we need to do was feed the digester with feedstock -- it does need any maintenance."
03,2021-06-01,16,"After installation, what kind of training were you given by the installers?",We were told how to start it - for instance we were told to ensure that all the valves were open during ignition.
03,2021-06-01,17,How many were trained? And who participated in the training?,They selected staff and prisoner.
03,2021-06-01,18,How many?,It was about 15 people.
03,2021-06-01,19,Were you part of the 15 people?,Yes...
03,2021-06-01,20,How prepared to run operate the reactor did you feel you were after the training?,We felt very much prepared to run the reactor since there was nothing complicated about switching it on.
03,2021-06-01,21,"What about maintenance, did you feel you were prepared to maintain it?","Yes, we learn how to solve gas leakage problems, as well as how to kick start it once chemicals shut down the system."
03,2021-06-01,22,How were you supposed to resolve these issues?,"By replacing leaking pipes or sealing punctured pipes and equipment. In regards to chemical shutting down the system, we were told to allow water to flush out chemicals in the digester and ensure that feed which was contaminated with detergents is totally removed. Then, we were supposed to start feeding the digester once again with new feedstock."
03,2021-06-01,23,How long was this training?,It was for one day.
03,2021-06-01,24,How did you meet your energy needs befor,"Before the digester were using electricity and firewood for cooking. For nsima we were using firewood, as for beans we were using electricity as it takes a longer time to get cooked."
03,2021-06-01,25,"I have noted that your biogas use manure, food waste and other waste - How did you manage your waste (the feedstock) before the reactor?","Human waste is contained in the septic tank and is emptied when it is full, while food waste is disregarded in waste bins for disposal."
03,2021-06-01,26,"Okay, how did the system work after commissioning?","Initially, it worked perfectly well and we were able to use the two stoves we have at the same time. But, after two days, when we switched on both stoves we were not able to get the same level of heat, only one was heating up with the same intensity while the other couldn't really heat up. We reported to the installers because at the time they had not formally handed over the biogas. They came and suggested that we should use one pot at a time. When we used one, it was good. When we switched on both stoves only one pot could heat up to cook on."
03,2021-06-01,27,Did they ever manage to get both stoves back to a level where you could cook with both stoves on?,No
03,2021-06-01,28,"So, what did they say?","They said little gas was being produced, but as time goes it was going to pick up as bacteria activity in the digester was going to increase with time and more gas was going to be."
03,2021-06-01,29,"Okay, how much gas was being produced?",They didn't tell us the amount gas it was producing but we were able to cook 3 times a day.
03,2021-06-01,30,"Aside from cooking, how did you use the gas?","Nothing else, it was simply for cooking."
03,2021-06-01,31,What were the operation requirements?,"They said we could use food waste and other biodegradable waste on top of, of course, human waste -- Any other waste excerpt plastic waste,"
03,2021-06-01,32,Why no plastic?,Because plastic doesn't decompose and can't produce bacteria that produce gas.
03,2021-06-01,33,How did you prepare that feedstock?,Before feeding the digester with food waste we were breakdown food waste into small by smashing and remove things like stones and plastics.
03,2021-06-01,34,How much food waste and other waste were you feeding the digester on a daily basis?,It was dependent on the amount of food leftover. Some days we were not feeding the digester.
03,2021-06-01,35,"On average, how much were you feeding the digester?",I would say a 60 litre bucket of food waste a day.
03,2021-06-01,36,How much water were you adding to the feedstock?,We were not adding water.
03,2021-06-01,37,"You mentioned that a septic tank for prisoners' toilets is connected to the digester, who many prisoners were in the prison the time the biogas was working?","We had about 500 prisoners but now the number is less as some were released due to Covid to ease congestion. Now, we have about 200 prisoners."
03,2021-06-01,38,That's like 500 people human waste was used by the system when it was in operation. Okay,Yes...
03,2021-06-01,39,Did they talk about maintenance requirements?,"Yes, they did."
03,2021-06-01,40,What did they say?,"They said before the official handover everything that had to do with maintenance was there responsibility. But after handover, we were going to be responsible for maintenance. Besides that they said they were going to teach us more about maintenance after handover. Nonetheless, they talked about little things like how to replace valves, - Like when a valve malfunctions, we just need to buy and replace. They said before handover, we could do such kind of maintenance."
03,2021-06-01,41,You were trained how to do such things I believe.,"Yes, they showed us how to replace valves."
03,2021-06-01,42,"Before the digestor failed, did it meet your needs?",It didn't.
03,2021-06-01,43,How? What were the gaps?,"We wanted it to work 100%. Unfortunately, we only managed to utilize it 50% as only one stove of the two functioned."
03,2021-06-01,44,"You said you classified the food you cook into two groups, one which needs more heat, and one which needs less heat. The time you were using the digester what were you cooking it for?",We used to use the digester to cook food which needs more heat. It was faster.
03,2021-06-01,45,What challenges were there?,The challenge was that we could only use two stoves at once. We noticed that when we were using two pots at once things couldn't get cooked and it was taking time for things to heat up. That's when they suggested using one stove at a time when both stoves couldn't heat up at the same time.
03,2021-06-01,46,"After you used it for two days you could only use one stove, I would like to know, how long did it take to stop working completely?",We used it from November of last year to end February of this year. We only used it for about four months.
03,2021-06-01,47,After 4 months you stopped using both stoves completely?,Yes...
03,2021-06-01,48,It doesn't show any sign of working? Zero?,It produces a little gas but you can't cook with it.
03,2021-06-01,49,"You said you were trained about 15 of you on its operation and how to fix it, so once the biogas reactor broke, what did you do? Did you try to fix it?","We didn't do anything because we were never told that problem -- The issue was not part of the training. So, we were never told how to fix the problem. Therefore, we called them and they said the system was producing little gas and would come to fix it."
03,2021-06-01,50,When was that?,Early March.
03,2021-06-01,51,Since March have they come to fix it?,"We have never gotten in touch since they said they were going to come to fix the digester. So, we are simply waiting for them to come and fix it."
03,2021-06-01,52,Do you feel they will come?,"(Laughs) I'm not quite sure, but I still think they will come because they didn't handover the project."
03,2021-06-01,53,Did they tell you the cause?,No.
03,2021-06-01,54,Have you seen something like this? What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?,"I have never seen this before. But, I think the information would have helped solve the problem and would increase our knowledge on the subject of biogas."
03,2021-06-01,55,We have done almost 80% of the interview. We are going towards the end. How would you describe the current state of the digester?,"I can say it\`s 50 -- 50. It just needs little fixing so we can start using the biogas again. It needs a complete overhaul of the feed and then introduce new feed to get the bacteria back on track. In my opinion, I feel there is something they didn't do right that time. They just need to come and address that something. Like they said, the digester is producing little gas, and they said will come and assess the digester to rectify the problem."
03,2021-06-01,56,What makes you feel and say -- they didn't do something right that time.,"Because if they hadn't missed something we would have been able to cook with two stoves for some time. As I have said, it only took 2 days for one stove to stop functioning properly, so it shows there was a deficit on their part."
03,2021-06-01,57,"In your opinion, what is the caused it to reach this state?","I believe what it caused it to reach this state is poor background in terms of installation as it didn't produce enough gas. Like I said, it didn't take long to stop working. It is also likely that there is a leakage somewhere. As you might observe, you can smell strange gas odor around the digester which shows that gas is escaping from the digester. So, you have a reactor which was producing small gas, and now some it's also leaking out gas. That's where we are now."
03,2021-06-01,58,"Okay, how do you manage your waste (feedstock) now that the reactor isn't working?","We don't produce lots food leftovers as the population of prisoners was reduced to almost half due to Covid. They little waste we get we dispose in a refuse pit, and after some time we use it as manure in the garden. I believe if it starts working again we will be advised to put extra waste on top of human waste to cover food waste deficit caused by the depopulation of the prisoners."
03,2021-06-01,59,"We are doing to the last sections, you have said you don't know how much money was spent, but it was funded by donors. Did Mulanje Prison contribute anything in kind?","There was nothing we contributed except for labor which cleared the site. As for digging, they came with an excavator which excavates the site. We also helped with labor which was responsible for carrying the materials."
03,2021-06-01,60,How many people were involved?,It was about 18 -- 25 people.
03,2021-06-01,61,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,They said they got the stoves from South Africa -- The biodigester bag was from South Africa. The other things were like cement and pipes were not imported.
03,2021-06-01,62,"We are remaining with 3 questions. Okay, the time it was working did it save you money in terms of energy consumption?",Yes
03,2021-06-01,63,Like how much were you spending on electricity and firewood?,"Before biogas we were getting a bill of K500, 000 per month. But when it was installed we were spending about K300, 000 per month."
03,2021-06-01,64,"Oh impressive, what is your opinion of biogas?",Biogas is good to use at an institution as well as at household level because it helps to protect environment. It is also important because it makes use of waste which we normally disregard to produce energy for cooking -- it's really a good thing.
03,2021-06-01,65,"Last one, If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?",I would prefer solar.
03,2021-06-01,66, **Interviewer**: Why solar?, **Interviewee**: Because it's cheap and it uses locally available resources so it's easy to maintain.
03,2021-06-01,67,"When you say it uses local available resources, what do you have in mind?","Solar panels, battery and invertors - such things are easily found here in Malawi. We have plenty of them in the hardware stores."
03,2021-06-01,68,This is the end of our interview. Thanks for your time.,NA
04,2021-06-02,1,Where did this digester originate?,"It came from Water For People as a demonstration. They said they brought it here because this village was first village to become open defecation free in T/A Chapananga. They said we were doing well in terms of latrine construction and hygiene practices. So, as a token of appreciation they decided to build a biogas here, and that this was one of the many that was to come."
04,2021-06-02,2,Did they explicitly say it was a demo?,Yes.
04,2021-06-02,3,"Tell me about the demonstration, how did it go?",After installation I remember calling them to inform about them that it was not producing biogas. They came and communicated that they were going to come again to fix the problem. But since that time they have never come again. And I heard their project phased out and the white man who was supporting them returned to his home.
04,2021-06-02,4,Did you meet the white man?,"Yes, he used to come as a matter of fact, this chair I'm sitting on he is the one who gave me (Laughs)."
04,2021-06-02,5,"(Laughs) you must have been very close. Okay, who designed it?","Aaaah, they didn't tell me who designed it. They just said they had finished similar interventions with other communities. And they went on to say, they wanted people from this community to learn from the initiative so that when they complete their project people should learn from me and replicate the same in their houses."
04,2021-06-02,6,Were people coming here to learn about the biogas?,"No, it wasn't like people from the community were coming to my house to learn. I believe they just wanted people to admire so that they could adopt the same in their houses."
04,2021-06-02,7,Who funded it?,I believe it came from water for people.
04,2021-06-02,8,"So, who built the digester? Was it people from this community or they brought people to build it?",They brought men who worked on it for three weeks.
04,2021-06-02,9,How many were they?,It was two guys. They stayed here with us during that time.
04,2021-06-02,10,What was your role?,I provided bricks and cattle manure which was used to initiate and boost the reactor before human waste was introduced into the reactor.
04,2021-06-02,11,How were you selected as a beneficiary?,"I was very much interested in WASH issues. And I was the first chief in T/A Chapananga to show interest in ensuring that people were constructing pit latrines to eliminate open defecation. This village was an exemplary village when it came to WASH issues, and even now it's still an exemplary village. So, that's why they decided to offer me the biogas to be the first demonstration site so that people would appreciate biogas technology."
04,2021-06-02,12,"Before this intervention, did you know about biogas?","No, I didn't."
04,2021-06-02,13,"Okay, take me through your introduction to biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Before commencement of construction work, they told me that human manure can be used to produce energy for cooking and lighting. They also said human manure can be used to make bricks. So, they recommended biogas because it reduces misuse and reliance of trees for firewood."
04,2021-06-02,14,"Honestly, I don't know how human waste can be turned into bricks. What did they say? How does it work?","They simply say there is a mechanism which turns human manure into bricks, but they didn't go into details."
04,2021-06-02,15,What were your expectations?,I expected to be able to cook without firewood (Laughs)
04,2021-06-02,16,What else?,Nothing else.
04,2021-06-02,17,"You have mentioned a number of things that biogas can do. For example, it can be used for lighting, cooking and making bricks. I want to know, what were you told to expect with it on your household?",I was told that I would have energy for cooking that I wouldn't need firewood for cooking.
04,2021-06-02,18,Anything else?,(Laughs) nothing else.
04,2021-06-02,19,What kind of training were you given by the installers?,"No, we didn't receive any training. I recall asking them to train members of chiefs committee on biogas or to take us to the communities where they have had similar projects to learn from them. They didn't heed our calls, so it didn't happen."
04,2021-06-02,20,"So, after installation you were told how it operates and how to operate it?",Not a bit. They didn't train us on that. And I believe that's why it failed. It failed because they just installed it and didn't give us the expertise to operate it.
04,2021-06-02,21,"This is very important -- I want to know when they finished building the reactor, what did they say in terms of its operation?",That's where they failed us. We were expecting to have training. We even asked for it so that we could share the information with other people from the community...We had the whole community committee which was present throughout the construction process and we were all hoping that we were going to have training on biogas after installation instead they simply taught us how to open and close the gas.
04,2021-06-02,22,Did they tell you to put water and all that?,"They said we should be adding water in the pit latrine, and also to feed the digester with manure, two -- 20L containers after every 2 to 4 days or so."
04,2021-06-02,23,Did they show you?,They simply told us.
04,2021-06-02,24,How prepared to run operate the reactor did you feel you were?,We were never able to use it.
04,2021-06-02,25,How long did it work?,"It could only produce fire for less than 2 minutes -- We never used it, we couldn't even boil water for bathing."
04,2021-06-02,26,How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? (i.e. cook),We have trees around which we use as firewood.
04,2021-06-02,27,"I have seen a number of goats around the house, how did you manage your waste (the feedstock) before the reactor?",We were using it as manure and we are still using it as manure.
04,2021-06-02,28,How did the system work after commissioning?,"It never worked because when we tried to cook or boil water, water couldn't boil. Only a little flame was coming out and it wasn't enough to heat anything. Then, we called them; they just said they will come. Since then they have never returned."
04,2021-06-02,29,How much gas was being produced?,They didn't tell us. And whatever it was you couldn't cook anything with it.
04,2021-06-02,30,"So, how did you use the gas?",We were told that we could use the gas for cooking but we never used it not even for a single time -- It never worked.
04,2021-06-02,31,What were the operation requirements?,We were told to use cow dung first then add pig or goat manure on top of human waste which was connected to the digester through a pit latrine in order to have an active feed.
04,2021-06-02,32,How many people were using the pit?,6 people.
04,2021-06-02,33,What volume of other waste was you advised to feed the digester?,We were told to pit 2 buckets of 20 litres of manure after every 4 days.
04,2021-06-02,34,How much water did you add?,2 buckets of 20 litres which translated to 40 litres of water.
04,2021-06-02,35,How did you prepare that feedstock?,"We asked to mix manure and water in the bucked the feed the digester, As for the pit latrine, we were told to put water in the pit latrine too."
04,2021-06-02,36,How much water?,"A bucket after a week or so, I don't really remember."
04,2021-06-02,37,Who was responsible for feeding the digestor?,The family was responsible for feeding the digestor.
04,2021-06-02,38,"Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?","They said if it stopped working we should consult them to come and fix the digestor. It was them who were solely responsible for maintenance because we couldn't do anything because we knew nothing on how to fix it when it malfunctioned. That's why I asked them to train the community committee members so that they could sort problems when it malfunctioned, unfortunately, it never happened. We knew that if they could train us on little things it would help because it was impractical and tiresome for them to come and fix every single problem."
04,2021-06-02,39,"They did tell you anything about maintenance, even the little about maintenance?","No, they didn't."
04,2021-06-02,40,You said the digester didn't meet your needs? How?,"They said we could use the digester for cooking and after sometime we would be able to use it for lighting as gas production increases. Unfortunately, we were not even able to use it for cooking."
04,2021-06-02,41,"So, taking all into consideration, what challenges did you encounter?","As you have seen. The pit latrine is full and blocked because I believe someone disposed a stone in the pit. We are having challenges as can't manage to empty it that we have just locked it. Also, we feel the dome wasn't properly constructed because it has cracks which we believe gas escapes from. Besides that masonry work wasn't done properly because most of it collapsed after a very little time."
04,2021-06-02,42,Why do you feel someone left a stone in the pit and it caused it to block?,"Initially, when we were using the pit latrine effluent would rise at the outlet and the pit latrine content would depress. We used to collect and use the effluent as manure for farming purpose. But, after some time we saw that the pit content was not depressing, and we couldn't have effluent at the outlet. That's when we released that it had blocked."
04,2021-06-02,43,"We are halfway through our interview, how long did you use it for before it stopped working?",We used it from 2018 to 2020 -- from 2018 that's when we noticed the problems -- 2020 that's when it stopped completely
04,2021-06-02,44,When was it built?,2016
04,2021-06-02,45,Did it work?,It worked in a sense that we were using the pit latrine as a toilet. As far as using it as an energy source for cooking were not able to do that from the onset.
04,2021-06-02,46,"Oh, technically used never used the biogas for cooking, but for other things like collecting effluent for farming and as a toilet?",Exactly.
04,2021-06-02,47,Did you ever try to fix it?,"When we saw that the dome had cracks, using our common sense, we thought we were not able to get enough gas for cooking because gas was escaping through the cracks. So, I hired a builder who tried to fix the cracks by lining it with cement but it didn't work, As for the pit latrine, we didn't do anything because we couldn't manage to reach the bottom to remove the stone to unblock it. Thus, we just left it, and that's why it is full and locked today."
04,2021-06-02,48,When did you notice the cracks?," **Interviewee**: It was in 2016, it didn't take long after they had completed the work. That's when I first called them to inform them of the problem. They did come and saw the problem. Then, they just said they were going to come again to fix it. Since then they have never come back."
04,2021-06-02,49,Like how long after they completed the work?,It was after 3 months.
04,2021-06-02,50,"Okay, did you try to follow up after?","The installers came to assess the problem and say they were going to return. I tried to follow up with their boss, a certain lady who used to come in a wrap-around cloth, \[name redacted\]. In the course of following up I learned she left Water For People for another organization. And that's when I stopped seeing Water For People. As for the white man, he was long gone to his countries, and I never saw him again after he gave me this chair."
04,2021-06-02,51,"I'm interested to know, when the people assessed the problem, what did they say was the problem? Or what was causing the problem?","They didn't say what the problem was. They just made it look like a simple problem. But, we released that it was a bigger problem than they made it look. And, we released that they couldn't fix the problem as it was beyond their expertise, because if it was something they could have managed to fix I'm sure they would have come and solve the problem. And I'm sure when they saw the problem, in their hearts, they knew they couldn't fix it, and that's why they never came back."
04,2021-06-02,52,Have you seen something like this (Shown a table intervention)? What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?,"It would have helped us because it would have guided us on how to solve same of the problems. For example, when they told me how much feed I was supposed to load, I was loading the feedstock as I was told. In the same manner, I would have been following what the table was recommending."
04,2021-06-02,53,We have done almost 80% of the interview; we are going towards the end. How would you describe the current state of the digester?,The digestor is not functioning -- it's completely dead.
04,2021-06-02,54,"In your opinion, what is the caused it to reach this state?","It failed because we were not provided with enough information and skills on how to operate and maintain it. In this community we have village committees, health committee which if were provided with expertise on biogas, I'm sure would have managed to maintain it."
04,2021-06-02,55,"Okay, what else?","I can say the digestor was not constructed the way it is supposed to be constructed. You can tell this by the simple fact that it never worked from the onset. Imagine, we never used it for cooking."
04,2021-06-02,56,"Okay, you said they constructed the digester for 2/3 weeks, and after they finished the work they saw that you couldn't use it for cooking and it was not producing gas. I would like to know, when they were leaving, what did they say? What happened?","We had no previous experience with biogas so when we saw a little gas and also told that after some time more gas was going to be produced, we were convinced that at some point we were going to use to have more gas and eventually use it for cooking. (Laughs)"
04,2021-06-02,57,"(Laughs) okay, the digester is not working, what are you using for energy i.e. cooking?",We are currently using firewood and charcoal.
04,2021-06-02,58,How do you manage your waste (feedstock) now that the reactor isn't working?,we are using manure as fertilizer for farming purposes.
04,2021-06-02,59,It works okay?,It works perfectly. And this year we are going to have a dumper yield than previous years.
04,2021-06-02,60,"You said it was funded by water for people, by any chance, do you know how much money was involved?","No, they didn't tell me."
04,2021-06-02,61,You said you provided bricks and manure. What else did you contribute anything in kind?,Only that -- Cement and everything else was provided for by Water For People.
04,2021-06-02,62,What you contributed was it voluntary or mandatory?,I was told to contribute those things so that they could start.
04,2021-06-02,63,What do you think could have happened if you failed to contribute such things?,"I don't know. They simply told me to contribute such things, and fact that I was interested to have the digester, I contributed without hesitation. Plus, manure wasn't a problem for me since I raise cattle and goats."
04,2021-06-02,64,"(Laughs) and being a chief too you wouldn't have struggle to siource such things, I guess. How much did it cost you to acquire the bricks?",It was provided for by someone from the community.
04,2021-06-02,65,How much labor was involved in terms of digging?,They hired 3 people to do the digging work.
04,2021-06-02,66,For how long?,They worked for 4 days.
04,2021-06-02,67,Masonry**?**,It was 2 people who came from Water For People.
04,2021-06-02,68,For how long?,2 weeks
04,2021-06-02,69,Was there any other work which was done?,"Yes, people were hired to collect water soaking stones which they used for the outlets -- The one I showed you. They said we needed those stones so that we would be able to harvest dry manure as the stones soak up water from the output."
04,2021-06-02,70,How many were involved in this task?,"It was the same 3 people, and they took some hour to do the work."
04,2021-06-02,71,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,Nothing.
04,2021-06-02,72,They didn't say anything was sourced from outside the country?,"No, they didn't."
04,2021-06-02,73,Did it save you money in terms of energy consumption or anything? Did it help you in anyway?,"No, it never worked so it didn't help use in terms of cooking. The only thing that was positive was that they built a pit latrine which was connected to the digester that we manage to use for some time."
04,2021-06-02,74,"We are going towards the end, we remaining with 2 questions. What is your opinion of biogas?","Biogas is a good thing -- It is something I was interest in and I'm still interested in. That's why when my wife told me you came; I was very much interested in your visit because I hoping that at the end of the day you will be able to rejuvenate the digester so that I can at least use it. Recently, I planned to dismantle the whole thing including the toilet because at the moment I don't have a toilet since it got full."
04,2021-06-02,75,What fascinated you about biogas?,"The fact that we can use human manure which many see as waste to produce energy for cooking and lighting is very interesting. Also, the fact that, we you can use it for cooking without using firewood and charcoal is very significant in terms of curbing deforestation in the community."
04,2021-06-02,76,"Last one, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?","I don't know any energy intervention that can use human waste to produce energy for lighting and cooking, so I'm limited of choices."
04,2021-06-02,77,(Laughs) this is the end of our interview. Thanks a lot the interview.,NA
05,2021-06-03,1,"Okay, where did the digester originate?","It was designed by a certain Tanzanian, and it was constructed by the same person."
05,2021-06-03,2,He came alone or with a team?,"He came alone, and he found people here who assisted him with the work. But, he basically did everything by himself. The other people were simply supporting him. For instance, He was laying the bricks; the people were simply passing him the bricks. So, basically he supervised the work and he was also on the forefront doing the work."
05,2021-06-03,3,Who funded it?,"I believe it was Kondanani, but I'm really sure about that. The director is better placed to answer this one."
05,2021-06-03,4,What was Kondanani\`s role?,"As for me, I was also involved in the construction work. Then after construction, the Tanzanian guy trained us how the system works to produce gas."
05,2021-06-03,5,Was it a donation or something that Kondanani paid?,"I don't really know. I just saw the person building the digester. So, I don't know what type of agreement was there."
05,2021-06-03,6,What happens here at Kondanani?,"It's an orphanage - There is a hospital, and we produce cheese."
05,2021-06-03,7,How did you know about biogas?,"Honestly, I came to know about biogas after the Tanzanian guy came to build our digester. I learnt more about biogas during that time -- we were told that the best manure for biogas is pig manure. It's better than cattle manure."
05,2021-06-03,8,How or why is pig manure better than cattle manure?,"He said pigs eat almost everything -- not just grass, that's why its manure is very good for biogas."
05,2021-06-03,9,What is your scope of work on this biogas?,I clean and collect manure from the barn; I prepare feedstock by removing debris from manure with a rake. Then I mix feedstock before feeding it into the digester.
05,2021-06-03,10,What were your expectations on biogas?,"We expected change in terms of waste management. Initially, we were just disposing of waste anyhow - we were disposing of waste in the banana plantation within premises. But, when biogas was installed, it improved cleanliness on the premise as waste is better contained in the digester. Also, it has helped us to reduce workload as it easier and nearer to dispose of water in the digester than disposing of waste at the banana site. Also, we expected to reduce work of preparing wood fuel."
05,2021-06-03,11,"Okay, what were you told to expect from the installer?","We were not told to expect anything, but people who work at the kitchen were told to expect more as biogas would replace use of firewood. This was very welcoming because people working at the kitchen were really struggling to source firewood for cooking. On our part, it only helped us by reducing the workload as waste is disposed of closer to the khola."
05,2021-06-03,12,"You touched on training, what kind of training were you given by the installers?","After installation, we were told that when feeding the digester feedstock should be free from debris to avoid blockages. Secondly, we were told to add sufficient water to avoid blockages as well. And also were told how to detect gas leakages within the system."
05,2021-06-03,13,How were you told to detect leakages?,He said when we see that there is little or no gas pressure at the stove we should know that its gas leakage. He also said when there is a leakage effluent at the outlet doesn't build up.
05,2021-06-03,14,How many were trained?,"We were about 5 people. And from that group I'm the only one remaining. So, I'm responsible for training other people on biogas as well when they are starting work."
05,2021-06-03,15,How prepared to run operate the reactor did you feel you were?,"At first we thought it was difficult thing to operate. But after the training we felt confident, and to say the trust, most of the things are not difficult to follow and implement. And after training, the installer stayed for some time to monitor how it was performing, and everyone was convinced that it was running well."
05,2021-06-03,16,Why did you think it's a difficult thing to operate at the beginning?,"You know when you have a new thing you always feel uncomfortable. Also, we felt nervous about working around gas as you know people say it's dangerous to work with and around gas. We had no option but to work as we couldn't do anything. But with time, we got used to the idea and we realised that it wasn't as scary as we thought as compared to LPG gas."
05,2021-06-03,17,So you feared gas.......,"Yes, we heard stories that a number of people have died in the process of cooking using gas. One thing though, the installer emphasised that we need to take extra care when handling manure."
05,2021-06-03,18,"Okay, how? Why?","We were told to wear personal protective equipment like groves, masks because the system produces strong odours at the outlet which may result into respiratory diseases."
05,2021-06-03,19,"I'm no biogas expert, so I'm not sure how you would come across the odours?","I get what you are saying. We don't come across the odour when we are feeding the digester, but at the outlet where the system releases effluent as by-products. The odour is strong enough that it is felt around the digester. So, we were told by the installer to wear PPE, but it is unfortunate the organisation doesn't provide us with proper PPE."
05,2021-06-03,20,Did you tell your bosses that you were told to wear PPE when working on the biogas digester?,"After corona they started giving us masks, so we use the masks to deal with the odour. As for other PPE, we just improvise by wearing dirty long clothes."
05,2021-06-03,21,Why did you choose to build a digester here?,"We were having problems sourcing firewood as we require huge chunks of firewood for cooking. Also, I believe they chose to build a digester to cut the cost of firewood."
05,2021-06-03,22,I believe you started work before the digester was built.....,That's very true
05,2021-06-03,23,"Okay, how did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? (I.e. cook)",We were using firewood but we were having problems because the director was against the use of trees as firewood. And when one was catch cutting trees by the director their salary was cut. And I believe that's why she decided to build a digester here.
05,2021-06-03,24,"That is interesting. So, where were you expected to source energy for cooking?",We didn't understand what she was up to -- that's why she brought the digester.
05,2021-06-03,25,"On the same, what was your Kondanani energy plan because I'm thinking, if she was against people cutting tree there was some sort of energy plan in place","I didn't really understand because we had to cook food, and we could only cook with firewood. But, she was very much angry when huge amount of wood was cut."
05,2021-06-03,26,How did you manage your manure waste?,"We had banana fields close to the dam, so we used to dispose of manure in the banana fields as fertilizer. We used to field children the same bananas as fruit after meal."
05,2021-06-03,27,Don't you think the coming of the digester negatively impacted your banana production?,"We bought the land together with the banana fields from Press Corporation, so the banana field wasn't part of Kondanani's plan. Our plan was to use the banana field to build houses and a football field as you can know see."
05,2021-06-03,28,How did the system work after commissioning?,"At first, it was working perfectly well -- better than now because we had so much cattle and pigs then. That time we had 150 pigs and 40 cattle so manure wasn't a problem."
05,2021-06-03,29,How long were you using it?,It was working from 6 AM -- 6 PM -- 12 hours. That time we were able to feed the digester daily with ample feedstock.
05,2021-06-03,30,How long do you use it now?,"They still use it from 6AM - 6PM. However, the number of people has reduced as compared to back then. Nonetheless, they still use it 3 times a day from 6 AM -- 6 PM."
05,2021-06-03,31,[\[response inaudible\]]{.mark},I don't really know. Maybe 300 or 200 now we are 100 or 150.
05,2021-06-03,32,How much gas does it produce?,"To be honest, I don't know. I think to know the actually amount of gas it produce we need to have measuring equipment, and unfortunately we don't have. However, we are able to detect the amount of feedstock in the digester by observing gas production at the stove. If the stove is burning with low pressure, we know the digester needs feeding to enhance gas production. Also when there is low or no feedstock in the digester, the flame is always blue and low."
05,2021-06-03,33,"Used you use the gas for cooking, how else did you use the gas?",There was nothing else -- we were only using it for cooking.
05,2021-06-03,34,"Okay, what are the operation requirements?",We only need manure and water. And when you mix them you need to stir well to get a smooth feed.
05,2021-06-03,35,"Okay, how much waste is needed?","We need 20 wheelbarrows of manure. However, we are able to get only 15 wheelbarrows of manure. So, to compensate the deficit we add more water."
05,2021-06-03,36,15 full wheelbarrows?,Yes.
05,2021-06-03,37,How much water do you add?,"We were told to add 7 drum of 200 Litres. But, now we don't put 7 drums as we have a tap just on the digester. So, we use the tap these days. And to know that we have added adequate water, we see water an overflow at the outlet."
05,2021-06-03,38,How long does it take for you to feed the digester?,"We feed 7 wheelbarrow of manure everyday if we fail to go collect other manure from our suppliers. If we are able to collect manure from them, we feed 15 wheelbarrows. To this, we open the tap from 7AM to 10 Am, and then at 1 PM we open again, because we add additional manure around that time. We were told that the digester is huge so when there is inadequate manure we should offset by adding more water. The digester is 4 meters deep with a length of 5 meters, so for gas to be produce there is a certain minimum level. So we always ensure that we reach that level by adding water to the digester regardless if we have manure or not to keep it working. Thus, if the manure and water is below that limit, you see people from the kitchen coming to say they are not getting gas at the stoves."
05,2021-06-03,39,"Okay, do you know the size of this limit?","I don't know exactly, but it's very deep like I said the digester is 4 meters deep and 6 meters long."
05,2021-06-03,40,Where do you get extra manure?,"We get it from the Roman Catholic Church right after the filling station. It's about 8 - 12 km from here. We get manure after 3- 4 days because they have only about 20 cows so we want to fill the truck with manure whenever we go there. As a result, we wait for them to collect and pile manure that when we go we collect a full truck of manure. We don't go daily because we want to collect enough manure as well as we save fuel by reducing number of trips."
05,2021-06-03,41,how did you manage to get the Roman Catholic people on board?,"I was approached and asked by the director how we could solve manure shortages. So, realised that I saw at the Roman Catholic Church they throw away manure. So I went there to ask them to be supplying us the manure. Lucky enough, they said we can be going to collect manure whenever we want to. We have been in touch with them for a month now. Before them we used to collect manure from a very far distant organisation, Kamphonje, but their cattle and pigs got diseased and died."
05,2021-06-03,42,How did you prepare that feedstock?,"we mix manure and water in a bucket, then with a rake with remove all the debris so that the feed is free from trash that can block the system. Then after a day we feed the digester with the feedstock."
05,2021-06-03,43,Who was responsible for feeding the digester?,"It is me, and my assistant. It is me who trained him about biogas as well."
05,2021-06-03,44,"Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?",It has never got broken ever since it was built. The only maintenance we do is on the inlet. There is a certain wood material which closes and opens the inlet. That thing get rotten most of the time as a result we simply replace it every now and them. The other work that has been done on the digester since it came is the introduction of a tap on the digester.
05,2021-06-03,45,what this wooden material?,"It is a wooden material with a mesh of wires which is placed on the inlet. It helps ensure that feed doesn't get into the digester during stirring. Thus, after stirring you take out the material to allow feed to get into the digester."
05,2021-06-03,46,Who is responsible for this task?,"We have a carpenter who is responsible for making that thing. It's not a difficult thing to do though, even myself I can do that."
05,2021-06-03,47,"Okay, Does the digester meet your needs?",(Laughs) it looks like we are able to cook as much as we like.
05,2021-06-03,48,There are no shortcomings?,(Laughs) No.
05,2021-06-03,49,"Okay, what challenges did you encounter apart from what you have already discussed?","we work without safety boots. The problem comes in especially when we are working with pig manure because it causes the skin to itch when it comes into contact with skin. The other thing, we work without proper clothing as a result, our clothes doesn't last long. In general, we need PPE to work safely."
05,2021-06-03,50,"You know you need proper PPE to work safely, have you tried to talk to your bosses about it?","I can't blame our current boss because he has provided us with safety boots. But, they say it's our duty to buy our own work suit. And as you know, we receive peanuts and we can't afford to buy a work suit as a result we work without a work suit. But, we really need a work suit because we work in a hostile environment."
05,2021-06-03,51,Why can't you say the same to you bosses?,"(Laughs) if you can complain like this, they will tell you that if you can't manage to work under such conditions, then you should just resign, and when you think of the problems at home, you are forced to work without PPE."
05,2021-06-03,52,What other challenge does it face?," **Interviewee**: We only have problems when there is no sufficient manure, as a result gas production drops. Other than that we face no challenges. The other thing is that we just need constant monitoring especially at the inlet to prevent blockages, and we always monitor the inlet to ensure that it doesn't block."
05,2021-06-03,53,How does this problem manifest?,"When it block, when you feed the digester you see that feeds doesn't get go inside the digester. So, we get a long stick to push and unblock the inlet. So, this happens mostly when the thing I have talked about gets damaged or when you feed the digester with dry manure."
05,2021-06-03,54,Has it ever stopped working before?,It has never stopped working for the past 9 years. For it to stop working there must be a puncture on the dome or a leakage along the pipes.
05,2021-06-03,55,Has there been a day where gas wasn't produced?,"There was a day where gas leaked. We thought we did everything correct in terms of feeding the digester and adding water to the feed, but we not getting flame on the stove."
05,2021-06-03,56,What happened after and how did you find the problem?,"One of the chefs noticed a strange odour around the kitchen area. That's when we were able to follow and detect that a pipe close to the kitchen wall was punctured due to rust, hence the smell. We removed the pipe and replaced it."
05,2021-06-03,57,Has it ever broken that you called the installer or someone from outside?,"No, it has never ever broken to that level, and since he left he has never been here again."
05,2021-06-03,58,How long did it take to notice the problem and solves it that day it stopped working?,"It was just some hours, it didn't fail completely."
05,2021-06-03,59,"Okay, have you seen something like this (shown table of interventions)? What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?","I have never seen something like this. But I think such information can help to solve problems that may arise since is it describing a problem and its possible solution. Thus, the information can assist in solving problems. And if it's possible it should have a copy."
05,2021-06-03,60,How would you describe the current state of the digester?,"In terms of perfomance I think it's in a perfect state and it has always been like this. The only challenge I see, we have problem with manure as we don't produce enough manure on our own."
05,2021-06-03,61,Why are you facing manure problem?,"We have lost cattle and pigs because of diseases. However, we have now bought new cattle so we will be okay."
05,2021-06-03,62,"We are going towards the end; we have about 20% remaining. You said it once stopped working for a day, that day what did you do for energy?","Like I said, it did not stop for the whole day. We were able to detect the problem the same day, later in the afternoon, that\`s when we called a plumber to change the pipe. But, that afternoon, we used firewood to cook."
05,2021-06-03,63,"Sure, how do you manage waste when there is abundant waste?",We have never reach that point because the digester is so huge that we have never fed it to its full before.
05,2021-06-03,64,we are going toward the end. How much did the reactor cost to build?,"I don't know the actual amount, but I heard 100 bags of cement was used, plus brick force wire and all that. It must be a lot of money"
05,2021-06-03,65,Who paid for it?,"I believe its Kondanani, and I'm sure it was not a donation because we usually find a name of the funder on the donated items, but on this one, there is no name which makes me believe it was Kondanani's money."
05,2021-06-03,66,Did you or your organization have to contribute anything in kind?,I can't know.
05,2021-06-03,67,How much labour do you think went into building digging?,I think 10 - 12.
05,2021-06-03,68,Masonry?,"It was one person. I mean all this was built by this one man, the rest of the guys were just supporting him with other work like carrying bricks and all that."
05,2021-06-03,69,What there any other works beside digging and masonry?,Refilling of soil which was done by the 10 labourers
05,2021-06-03,70,"I believe you were here throughout the construction process, what kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?","I didn't here that anything was imported. And the things I saw they didn't look like they were from outside Malawi -- and I have seen them here, for example, cement, lime and the brick force wire."
05,2021-06-03,71,Did the reactor save you money in terms of energy consumption?,"Yes, because before the digester we used to buy LPG for cooking but now we don't use it anymore, therefore, I can say it saving us money. Also, the amount of wood we were using for cooking is lesser than we were using before the digester. Of course, we still use firewood and LPG for cheese production, but it's not as much."
05,2021-06-03,72,We are going towards the end of our interview. We are remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas?,"In my opinion, biogas is a good thing because it protects the environment, and at the same time it saves money as it is cheaper than electricity and firewood. So, it's very good."
05,2021-06-03,73,How does it protect the environment?,It lessens the use of trees which promotes circulation of fresh air and rainfall.
05,2021-06-03,74,"Last one, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?",I would stick with biogas because of its ability to be used as an energy source for cooing as well as a manure making product.
05,2021-06-03,75,"Thanks for the interview,",NA
06,2021-06-04,1,Where did this digester originate?,We bought it from German -- From a company called Catrine.
06,2021-06-04,2,Who designed it?,It terms of installation or the digester itself?
06,2021-06-04,3,Both,"The digester was designed in German by Catrine. As far as installation, we sent someone to go to Germany to learn about its installation and to then install and train people here at Green Malata."
06,2021-06-04,4,Who is this someone?,It's a not a Malawian. It was a Dutch who was working in the renewable energy department here at Green Malata.
06,2021-06-04,5,I can see that it was a process and a fortune was spent to have the digester running. Who funded it?,It was funded by our usually donor Children's Fund Malawi.
06,2021-06-04,6,Who else?,It was only Children's Fund Malawi.
06,2021-06-04,7,What was your role as Green Malata?,"We are project implementers of Children's Fund Malawi. So, our role is to be the end user of the biogas digester."
06,2021-06-04,8,"So, what was your involvement in the process?","As Green Malata, during the installation of the biogas digester and training we selected one person from each department to learn about biogas in terms of its operation and benefits. We also trained people from the nearby community on the same."
06,2021-06-04,9,How did you identify these people?,"Initially, we train students in renewable energy in terms of solar and windmill. So, we the coming in of biogas digester we thought it wise to incorporate the student in the training. Thus, student and heads of departments were part of the process. Also, we targeted and incorporated people from Ntilamanja community who had cattle and pigs because we believed that they had the potential to purchase and run a biogas digester. So, we targeted them to introduce them to biogas with the intention that they should appreciate what biogas is, and hopefully adopt the technology in their households and community at large."
06,2021-06-04,10,Who built it?,It was the people who were involved in the training because the train was designed in a way that we were directly implementing what we were being taught.
06,2021-06-04,11,"Before this intervention, did you know about biogas?","We had no knowledge of biogas. But, we saw that cost for firewood was getting very high -- like K75, 000 a month, so we to search for an alternative to reduce the cost that's when we found biogas."
06,2021-06-04,12,"Okay, what were your expectations?","Our expectation was that biogas was going to help us reduce cost incurred from using firewood. We knew it wasn't going to completely eliminate firewood use though. So, we thought of using electricity for cooking but it was not practical because electricity cost is too high. So, our expectation was to use biogas together with firewood for cooking."
06,2021-06-04,13,Why did think that biogas was and is not sufficient to stop you from using completely?,"Our demand for energy is high that biogas digester can't meet since it produces little gas sufficient for our need. Also, even if we maximized gas production, we knew methane gas doesn't produce strong heat enough to cook things like beans which requires intense heat. That's why we use biogas to cook things like nsima, but for beans we use fire wood."
06,2021-06-04,14,"You mentioned you sent someone from Netherlands to go learn about biogas, what were you told to expect from biogas by this person?","We were told to expect to learn more about different types of biogas technologies that are available on top of the one we have -- technologies simple enough to be adopted at a household level. Also, we were told that we can maximize gas production to a level that would allow us to commercialize our gas production to nearby communities."
06,2021-06-04,15,What kind of training were you given by the installers?,"During the training we had a training manual which outlined what biogas is, what type of gas it produces, its operation and maintenance, and its full installation."
06,2021-06-04,16,What was the setting?,It was a like class -- we had it for 2 weeks.
06,2021-06-04,17,How many participated?,"It was 5 people form different departments, 2 chiefs, 2 people from the community and 3 previous students from renewable energy department. In total, it was 12 people."
06,2021-06-04,18,What was the selection criterion?,"We had to select people from the community who are committed farmers with cattle to maximize their farming in 2 ways: one to use manure for fertilizer, and to use manure for energy -- we wanted them not to use manure only farming. We recognized chiefs for their leadership role towards community development that's why they were part of the training. Also, we incorporated students in renewable energy to enhance the knowledge and expertise on the subject."
06,2021-06-04,19,"Okay, how prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were after the training?","I felt so confident because, the training was hands-on -- whatever we were learning, we were also doing on the ground. And, at the end of the training we managed to install a biogas system which produced gas sufficient for cooking. So, you can see that the 2-week training was successful. On top of that, after we finished the training and installing the biogas here, we also had an opportunity to install one at the chief's house. So, you can see that the training was successful and we felt that we could install and operate the reactor."
06,2021-06-04,20,"Okay, why did you choose to build a digester here?","We decided to build a biogas system because we wanted to reduce the cost of using firewood as well as alleviate environmental impacts due to massive cutting down of trees. Also, we chose to build a biogas because of its ability to produce manure on top of producing energy for cooking. It was no brainer to go for biogas once we learned that biogas system also produces manure as a byproduct which we could use for farming since we are very much into farming. Thus, we chose biogas because the system would address our cooking needs as well as produce manure for farming."
06,2021-06-04,21,"Okay, so before biogas, how did you meet your energy needs?",We used firewood.
06,2021-06-04,22,"Apart from firewood, what else?","Nothing else, but we have a business restaurant which requires sufficient energy for refrigeration, cooking so we use electricity and LPG gas at the restaurant. And we mostly use electricity in the restaurant because Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a bit expensive, and we use LPG only when electricity goes off."
06,2021-06-04,23,"okay, where were you getting all the firewood then?","Initially, we had tea estate companies which were giving us firewood as most of them do plant blue gam -- so they were sharing us firewood. On top of that we used to buy firewood, which we still buy these days."
06,2021-06-04,24,How was it possible for them to donate firewood to you?,"We had a partnership with a tea estate company. Where we are sitting used to be a tearoom so many people where coming to have tea here -- Many of them were people from outside the country. As a result, we used to use the tearoom to market and promote their tea -- Because of that partnership they willing to donate firewood to us."
06,2021-06-04,25,Which company is that?,Eastern Produce Tea Estate.
06,2021-06-04,26,"I have seen that you use manure to operate the biogas, how did you manage your waste (the feedstock) before the reactor?","We used to use the manure as fertilizer. As I have pointed out, we have gardens so manure used to go straight to the gardens. In certain cases, we used manure for making compost which we still do now."
06,2021-06-04,27,And everything was going on smoothly?,"Yes, there are a number of things that ensure sustainability of this organization. One of them is that we don't buy vegetables. We produce vegetables for consumption using our own manure."
06,2021-06-04,28,How has the coming of biogas affected your farming? Hasn't vegetable production decreased because manure is now used for biogas?,"No, it didn't affect us in any way because we have a number of cattle sufficient for biogas and farming. We have enough manure that some we keep for future use as well. Besides, we practice natural agriculture meaning to say we don't apply chemicals to our animals. This helps to keep the biogas running because we are assured to feed the digester with the manure all times."
06,2021-06-04,29,"You said you sent someone from Netherlands to learn biogas. He came, you had your hands-on training and finally installed it, how did the system work after commissioning?","It worked perfectly with no deficiencies. Besides, we had Dutch guy around to make sure that the biogas was working okay as well as ensure that we were able to maximize gas production to a level we could sell the gas to other companies and surrounding communities which use firewood for energy. So, the biogas worked quite well, the only challenge we had was our inability to produce enough gas to sell due to the fact that we did not invest further biogas to be able to reach the communities."
06,2021-06-04,30,"Okay, how much gas was being produced?","Our biogas which is 6\*2m produce 3 bags of gas on a sunny day -- in summer -- From August to December...\... It can go as far as 4 bags of gas depending on the weather of the day. Of which, we could only use 2 bags to cook 3 meals a day giving us an opportunity to store 1 or 2 bags of gas for future use. It is possible to store gas -- and we store gas in harvesting bags."
06,2021-06-04,31,"To have a clear picture, I would like to know how long use it to prepare those meals, and the quantity of the meals","I will put it as a percentage. Initially, we used to use high volume of firewood, like K75, 000 per month on firewood. After biogas, we could only use 75% firewood and 25% biogas for meals of 120 -150 people three times a day. We use firewood to cook heavy meals which need more energy like Nsima for a larger group of people. We use biogas to cook things that need less energy like vegetable as well as Nsima for a small number of people."
06,2021-06-04,32,When you decided to buy a biogas digester did you envision that you could only produce and use 25%?,"Our target was to produce and use 50% for cooking, and the rest to use it as an income generating system because we believe that on top of donor funds we need our own income generating activities to cater for other expenses."
06,2021-06-04,33,"So, clearly, your expectations were not met. Can we say it's a failure to some extent?","Yes, you can say it's a failure because our hope was to get it to 50% but we managed 25 -- 30%."
06,2021-06-04,34,Why do you think it was a failure? We are you at 25%?,"I believe the biogas we bought couldn't match that target. Besides, maybe our expectations were very high."
06,2021-06-04,35,Why do you say that?,"Mmmh, having had firsthand experience with the biogas digester I don't think it can produce enough gas to reach many people as we thought -- I don't know how big the reactor has to be to get that amount of energy (Laughs)."
06,2021-06-04,36,"Apart from using the gas for cooking, how else did you use the gas?","Initially, we used the gas for cooking food as well as for baking at our confectionary. However, we saw that the bakery oven was consuming more gas that it was affecting our cooking, that's when we decided to use it for cooking only."
06,2021-06-04,37,What happened to the bakery?,"We still have bakery, but we don't use biogas because it doesn't produce enough energy to run the oven."
06,2021-06-04,38,"Okay, what were the operation requirements?","Firstly, we got a biodigester bag, harvesting bags and pipes we got from Germany. However, there was some equipment that was required that we had to make on our own like the burner. So, we had a team from the welding and fabrication who worked on the burner so that it could produce energy. Luckily enough the team improvised and came up with a burner. As a matter of fact, all the burners that we use we made ourselves."
06,2021-06-04,39,"Not anyone can do such an impressive job, how was the team able to build a burner?","Our manager has a qualification in welding and fabrication and metal work, so he has the expertise to build a burner **--** so, he designed and put together the burner."
06,2021-06-04,40,"Oh, he did all that himself?","Yes, he worked on the burner by himself with support from other staff and students. But, the bakery oven was mainly done by a consultant."
06,2021-06-04,41,Who is this consultant?,It was a certain technician. He retired because he was diseased with a respiratory problem due to prolonged exposure to smoke.
06,2021-06-04,42,What was the feedstock requirement? Manure Ummhu....,"Cow dung, kitchen waste and sometime we feed sugar or maize flour. We also put milk or sour milk to facilitate bacteria activities in the reactor to boost gas production. Thus, we feed manure, kitchen waste, and additives as well as water."
06,2021-06-04,43,Where did you get the information that you also need additives to boost gas production?,"Initially, this information was not provided by the Dutch guy; rather, as time went by we had an opportunity to research this information on the internet."
06,2021-06-04,44,Who spearheaded this process?,It was our director.
06,2021-06-04,45,"Okay, how do you prepare that feedstock?","At the cowhouse we have a team that collects dung in buckets to feed the digester. The guys mix dung and water in buckets, just like you have seen. So, the guys feed the digester after every 2 or 3 days. If dung is excess they store dung for future use, because dung can be stored in buckets."
06,2021-06-04,46,"Okay, how much dung do you feed the digester?","We feed 2 buckets of 50L manure per feed -- That's 100L of dung which we add 100L of water. Thus we mix 100L volume of dung and 100L of water and stir till the mixture becomes watery, then we feed after every 2 or 3 days."
06,2021-06-04,47,Who feeds the digester?,"We have 2 people responsible for feeding the digester. On top of these, we have \[name redacted\] from renewable energy department who supervise them, and is also responsible for monitoring operations and maintenance issues."
06,2021-06-04,48,"Okay, what are the maintenance requirements?","Most of the maintenance work is on the dome of the green houses which regulates temperature on the digester**.** The structure needs constant maintenance because it is made of bamboo material so gets eaten every now and then. But, we are thinking of using metal bars in place of bamboo to enhance durability of the structure."
06,2021-06-04,49,Was this also part of the training?,"No, it's something that we are thinking of improvising."
06,2021-06-04,50,How?,"(Laughs) There are something that we just observe and decide to do differently to suit our available resources, because we have an innovative team that handles that very well. Just to add, there are so many things that we learned that we don't implement, instead we improvise to meet our local resources."
06,2021-06-04,51,"Okay, who handles these things? Who is responsible for maintenance?","We have a department of maintenance that is responsible for all maintenance work here. For example, if people who work on the biogas digester observe a fault, they write to the maintenance department to fix the problem."
06,2021-06-04,52,"After installation, did the reactor meet your needs?","Mmmh (Takes long to respond) ....... During the first 8 months it didn't meet our needs because one reactor was not certainly enough in terms of gas production. But, after 8 months we sourced another digester, that's when our needs started to be met."
06,2021-06-04,53,What were the gaps?,"Yes, challenge comes in when we want to balance the use of antibiotic and other chemicals for cattle management with using dung of the same cattle. Our standard practice is to avoid use of antibiotic and chemicals for cattle management. However, it reaches a point where we have no choice but to use antibiotics, for instance, when we have diseased cattle that need medication. In this case, we separate diseased cattle from healthy cattle so that dung for diseases cattle injected with antibiotics is not fed in the digesters. This is important because when dung containing antibiotics is fed in the digester it shuts down the reactor as it kills all bacteria in the digester as a result gas production cease completely. The possible solution for this is by flushing out the feed -- that's where you remove feedstock and clear the bags with water, and then you put new feedstock so that the process starts again. We have had this problem before where a staff fed one of the two digesters with dung containing antibiotics. We flushed it out and it was restored. Also, the system is made of nylon plastic which breaks, and when it breaks, it causes leakages which reduce gas production. We normally detect this problem by noticing strange smell especially in the green house structure."
06,2021-06-04,54,"So, what other challenges do you encounter?","Mostly, it's what I have already explained. But the other challenge is that not all materials can be sourced within Malawi. For instance, we were told to use ordinary plastic to cover the green house, but we realized that after 2 or 3 weeks, the plastic was getting damaged. And you should know that the greenhouse structure can't work properly without proper covering. So to deal with this problem we made a heavy duty plastic covering, and since then the problem hasn't occurred."
06,2021-06-04,55,"You mentioned that it hasn't been smooth sailing, at some point one digester failed. How did these problem manifest?","We had an incident where someone unknowingly fed the digester mixed dung from healthy cattle with dung from cattle on antibiotic treatment. This caused the digester to cease working. Our standard practice is to separate cattle on antibiotics for one week from healthy cattle. But, that time we failed to do that, and it broke down the digester."
06,2021-06-04,56,"How did it stop working, did it stop gradually or it just stopped at once?","No, it was gradual process *--* Gas production diminishes slowly to a point where it ceases completely because bacterial activity does not stop at once when you feed it antibiotics."
06,2021-06-04,57,"We are almost half way, Okay, how long did you use it for before it stopped working?",It took a year then that's when that happened. And it took about 3 weeks from the time we started noticing the decrease in gas production to a point where gas production completely ceased.
06,2021-06-04,58,"When it stopped working, where was the Dutch guy?",She wasn't with us then -- she was back in Netherlands.
06,2021-06-04,59," **Interviewer**: So, once it broke, did you try to fix it? What did you do?","We tried to reach out to Dutch guy, and also we searched on the internet to learn more about the problem and its possible solution. Then, through our research we found out that the problem caused by antibiotics which found their way into the digester as a result of mixing cow dung for healthy cattle and cow dung for cattle which was on antibiotic treatment."
06,2021-06-04,60,"You have said during your training you were given a manual, I presume it also outlined issues and their possible solutions?","No, it didn't address troubleshoot issues and its solutions. It only talked about installation in terms of what material are required to install a biogas and all that."
06,2021-06-04,61,(shown table of interventions) have you seen something like this?,I have never seen something like
06,2021-06-04,62,What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you the time one digester failed?,"I believe the information is very helpful and could have helped us solve the problem easily. Like I said, everything we do is based on the information we were given during training. So I believe with the expertise we have and with this kind of information, we could have been and we can be better placed to operate and maintain the biogas digester."
06,2021-06-04,63,How would you describe the current state of the digester?,It is in good state and gas production is quite okay.
06,2021-06-04,64,"From my understanding, you started with one reactor but it wasn't enough then you bought another one. After some time, one failed but you were able to fix it. And now you have said you current state is okay. In your opinion, what is the caused it to fail at that time? And how have you managed to be fully operational again?",In the first cause it failed because we mixed cow dung containing antibiotics with dung of healthy cattle. And I think we have managed to be where we are because we have a capable team which is committed and innovate.
06,2021-06-04,65,"Out of curiosity, how did you know that it failed because you mixed the dung?","We observed, like I said we observed for three weeks, from the time we gave the cattle antibiotics to the time it failed, because gas production in one digester started diminishing some days after we gave the cattle antibiotics. Besides, we searched on the internet and it showed that antibiotics and detergents kill bacteria in digester, and eventually they break down digester systems."
06,2021-06-04,66,"(Laughs) okay, when one digester failed, what did you do for energy i.e. cooking?","Like I mentioned we have two, so when one digester failed the demand for firewood increased as gas production reduced due to the failure. Thus, when one digester failed more firewood was required."
06,2021-06-04,67,How did you manage your waste (feedstock) when one reactor failed?,We used to store waste and some we were using as manure.
06,2021-06-04,68,We have done almost 80% of the interview; we are going towards the end. How much did the reactor cost to build?,"It cost us K350, 000 -- K400, 000 then. I believe it must be around K600 000 now because of how prices of goods have risen."
06,2021-06-04,69,When did you buy it?,It must be in 2016 or 2017
06,2021-06-04,70,Who paid for it?,It was a donation from children's fund Malawi
06,2021-06-04,71,Did your organization contribute anything in kind?,"Yes, in terms of labour and expertise in producing things which were not available like burner and covering."
06,2021-06-04,72,How much labor was involved in terms of digging?,"It was basically everyone who was involved in the training, and people who were responsible for masonry work -- 15 people"
06,2021-06-04,73,Masonry**?**,It was 3 people.
06,2021-06-04,74,For how long?,2 weeks
06,2021-06-04,75,Was there any other work which was done?,"Yes, there was need for plumbing work to fit pipes -- one person did that."
06,2021-06-04,76,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,"The harvesting bags and biodigester bags were imported from Germany, and plumbing items. Yet, we came to a realization that most of the plumbing items which we thought we couldn't find locally are locally available -- We have seen them in local hardware stores here in Mulanje and Thyolo. For example, the 100mm pipes which were installed are locally available in the hardwire stores though the quality is not the same."
06,2021-06-04,77,Are the digesters saving you money in terms of energy consumption?,Yes.
06,2021-06-04,78,"Please, can you quantify it?","Like I said, we used to spend K75, 000 on firewood, so from that take away 25 -- 30 %."
06,2021-06-04,79,"We are going towards the end, we remaining with 2 questions. What is your opinion of biogas?","Biogas is a viable technology, and it's of capable replacing sources of energy that degrades the environment like use of firewood. For example, at a household it can address all energy needs, and at a household institution it can reduce cost for energy."
06,2021-06-04,80,"Last one, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?","look at other option, I think it is to easier and more practical to adopt simple biogas technologies that use manure or food waste to generate energy than other interventions because other interventions are expensive and complex to develop. Thus, I would design simple biogas technologies instead."
06,2021-06-04,81,(Laughs) this is the end of our interview. Thanks a lot the interview.,NA
07,2021-06-05,1,"Okay, where did the digester originate?","It came from Ecogen, a Malawian company which sell biogas digesters."
07,2021-06-05,2,Who designed it?,"The digester was imported from Kenya so I presume the digester was designed in Kenya. As far as installation and everything, it was Ecogen who did all that."
07,2021-06-05,3,Did you pay for it or it was a donation?,We paid for it.
07,2021-06-05,4,How much did you pay for it?,"We paid K600 000 plus, but not more than K700 000. K 600 000 was for the digester, while the other was for labour, water cost and all that."
07,2021-06-05,5,"So, who built it?","It was built by Ecogen with the support from our labourers, under Ecogen supervision."
07,2021-06-05,6,Did you know about biogas before?,Yes. I knew about biogas before I met Ecogen guys.
07,2021-06-05,7,How did you know it?,I learnt about biogas from Kenya and also on YouTube.
07,2021-06-05,8,You have been Kenya?,I saw on internet how people in Kenya were using manure to produce energy.
07,2021-06-05,9,"Okay, what were your expectations?",After I saw the videos from Kenya or after I met Ecogen?
07,2021-06-05,10,Both......,"My thoughts after I saw Kenya biogas videos I was like I need this. So, before I met Ecogen, I did my own experiment with manure to see if what I saw on the internet from Kenya was practical. Luckily enough, it was a successful experiment -- it worked. After that, I was introduced to Ecogen by a friend. When I met Ecogen, I wanted a biogas digester which uses manure, but at the time they had food waste biogas digesters from China. They promised that they would get back to me once they got it, and after sometime they reached back to me that they had the biogas digester in store, and that's when I bought this one. .."
07,2021-06-05,11,Okay great. Could you please take me through the experiment you had?,"I was lucky that my neighbour had cow dung on his compound. I took some of the cow dung, add water and put it in a 5 litre plastic bottle. Then, I bought an intravenous drip, made a hole on a 5 litre bottle and connected the drip to the bottle and closed the drip. After that I was checking the pressure, and the bottle was expanding each day because of the pressure, and each day I was trying to light up the flame. I tried it for a couple times, it didn't work, but after 40 or 50 days it produced a flame at the opening end of the drip after I ignited a match stick, then that's when I knew that these things really work."
07,2021-06-05,12,"Wow, amazing. What were you expecting to use biogas for?","My desire and wish was to produce biogas that I could sell in order to improve the livelihood of people within the community. That was my first desire. Of course, I knew if I could have such a system, I was also going to be able to use it for cooking as well. I also expected to be able to store gas. Just last week, I was at a children's party, I saw a jumping castle so I thought to myself that I can turn a jumping castle into a gas storage chamber, you see. So, at the moment I'm at a stage where I'm just trying things out and to see if it's viable and sustainable. Yesterday, I was at Game Store to see yoga balls and see if I could turn them into harvesting bags -- but I wasn't impressed with their size. They are a little small for storage purposes. That said I want a biogas digester because I'm a farmer and I want to use manure from my cattle for energy and farming. I also feel I have an obligation to help the community in terms of energy by supplying them with biogas."
07,2021-06-05,13,"From what you have seen so far, do you think you will be able to reach the level you will be able to supply others with biogas?","Of course, at the moment, I'm reaching out to people who have cattle to consider about owning a biogas digester. If they can't afford the biogas digester, then they can buy biogas from me. As it stands though, we are having challenges in a sense that people are failing to understand what biogas is and what it does. So, at the moment, I'm mostly involved in selling biogas effluent which is manure as well as a pesticide and a supplement to livestock."
07,2021-06-05,14,"Okay, what were you told to expect by the installer?","They told me that biogas can be used for cooking as well as on a generator. Actually, I saw this on the internet, so I was lucky to meet Ecogen to explain the same thing to me. I'm very thankful to Ecogen that I have learnt a lot from them. And my passion for gas technology, both LPG and biogas has elevated because of them."
07,2021-06-05,15,"You seem very passionate and well versed in gas technology, where did you get all this passion?","I'm not well knowledgeable about gas technology; I believe I'm still learning. However, my interest in gas technology didn't come because of gas; it came because of my interest in environmental protection which started when I was part of organisation called Green Initiative at Chancellor College. During that time we were advocating the use of briquettes to prevent deforestation and environmental impacts. So from there on I have had a great interesting in environmental management."
07,2021-06-05,16,Okay what kind of training were you given by the Ecogen?,"Yes, we had training. The training was mostly about how and what to feed the digester with, use of effluent and how to replace a filter."
07,2021-06-05,17,How many were trained?,They trained my family as well as the team that helps us with the work.
07,2021-06-05,18,How prepared to run operate the reactor did you feel you were?,"I felt prepared but not only because of the train but also for the knowledge from the internet. There are so many things I have learnt from the internet that even Ecogen did not explain to me. For example, about using a jumping castle as a harvesting bag, that thing Ecogen did not mention. But, because of my interest in biogas I have been able to learn more about biogas, and I'm always looking for way to improve my biogas system."
07,2021-06-05,19,"You have said you chose have a reactor here because of you interest in biogas, your desire to help the community, and of course to be able to use it for energy as well as agriculture. Apart from what I have said, is there anything else why you chose to build a digester here?","Aaaah, that's all."
07,2021-06-05,20,"Okay, how did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? (I.e. cook)",We were using Liquid Petroleum Gas as well as firewood and charcoal.
07,2021-06-05,21,How did you manage your manure waste before the intervention?,"We were doing nothing with the manure because we didn't have the capacity to transfer it to our farms to be used as manure. But, we had the desire to use it as manure."
07,2021-06-05,22,"Ok, how did the system work after commissioning?","At first, it wasn't as it now; it was just manure and water in the digester bag. The bag wasn't inflated as it now. We were told that it would inflate after some time and gas will be produced. They also said, we will see gas bubbles in one of bucket after sometime, that's how we will know that they system has started working."
07,2021-06-05,23,How long did they say it will take for the system to start working?,It stayed about 3 weeks.
07,2021-06-05,24,So after 3 weeks it worked?,"Yes, after 3 weeks it worked, however it got deflated after a little time."
07,2021-06-05,25,How?,I believe it wasn't really ready. I mean what they meant was that after 3 weeks the system was going to able to produce gas and flame to cook with.
07,2021-06-05,26,How much gas does it produce?,"We haven't done the calculations to know how much gas it produces. And for me to be able to know how much gas it produces I may need to have a storage bag. But I believe after some time I will be able to know how much gas it produces because for now I have not stayed with it for long enough, only four months."
07,2021-06-05,27,How do you use the gas?,We are only using it for cooking.
07,2021-06-05,28,"Okay, what are the operation requirements?",We use manure and water.
07,2021-06-05,29,Where do you get manure?,We have a barn behind.
07,2021-06-05,30,How many cattle do you have?,We have 6 cows -- three big ones and 3 small ones.
07,2021-06-05,31,Do they generate enough manure for the digester?,Yes.
07,2021-06-05,32,How much manure do you feed the digester?,We put a 40 litre bucket of manure every day
07,2021-06-05,33,How much water do you add?,"We add 80 litres of water. One bucket of manure, we add two buckets of water. Two buckets of manure against four buckets of water."
07,2021-06-05,34,How did you prepare that feedstock?,"We mix manure and water then stir the mixture. After that, we remove trash from the mix like stone, plastic paper and all that. Let me show you how we do it. When we have manure like this, we can't remove trash directly from the manure, it\`s difficult to do. So we add water them stir, Afterward, we removes all the trash that come on top on the mixture."
07,2021-06-05,35,Who was responsible for feeding the digester?,"It is me, and the workers."
07,2021-06-05,36,"Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?",When it blocks or fails Ecogen will come to fix the problem because we have an agreement in place on maintenance issues.
07,2021-06-05,37,What's agreement?,"We have a ten year warranty with them. So, if the digester malfunctions it is the Ecogen\`s duty to come and fix without charge."
07,2021-06-05,38,Ten years? Do you genuinely believe that they will honour that agreement?,Yes.
07,2021-06-05,39,Why?,"They are professionals and a legit company so I have to take them by their word. They said they will fix anything within 10 years if it ever has a problem. So, I don't have to doubt them."
07,2021-06-05,40,"What was the form of agreement, verbal or written?",Verbal.
07,2021-06-05,41,"Without Ecogen, are you in a position where you can be able to fix it on your own?","Mmmh, no."
07,2021-06-05,42,"Okay, Does it meet your needs?","At the moment, no."
07,2021-06-05,43,How?,"The biogas digester has only been installed so it hasn't reached its peak but with time it will pick up. Also, the weather at the moment is no ideal; we are hoping that in the summer everything will be okay. Because, I believe bacterial activity and metabolism is best during hot season."
07,2021-06-05,44,"So, when you want cook, how long do you use it?",I use it the whole day where the whole day shall mean breakfast and supper time. We don't normally eat lunch so we don't use it around lunch time.
07,2021-06-05,45,"Okay, what challenges did you encounter apart from what you have already discussed?","We are currently experiencing low pressure. But, I don't take it as a problem; I see it as an opportunity to learn, so it's not a problem. I can conclusively say there is no problem - it's just that I'm a time where I'm getting the much needed experience to learn and improve the biogas."
07,2021-06-05,46,"You say low pressure does exist, and clearly that's a problem, but you say it's not a problem but an opportunity, what do you mean?","When we start the biogas, it doesn't produce enough heat or flame on the stove to cook food, so to address this we put a bag on top of the digester bag to increase pressure and flame or heat at the stove, so you can see at the end of the day, we are still able to use it as much as we want it -- so to me it\`s not a challenge."
07,2021-06-05,47,In the 4 months you have had it has it ever stopped working?, **Interviewee: No.**
07,2021-06-05,48,"Why do you think in the four month you been able to keep it working, because that's not an easy feat use it for 4 months, some do not last even last a month?","I believe we are able to handle it with care. Also, I think our design is durable. But, I think it's all about durability of the system because you can use some with carefully but if the system is not durable it breaks down."
07,2021-06-05,49,You have said you are currently facing low pressure challenges. So have you tried to reach out to Ecogen to fix the problem? What have you done?,"I have never talked to them about the problem because I sincerely believe it not their fault in term of its installation but it's that the system has yet hit the ground running yet. But, it will hit the ground running and work perfectly with time. And when I get fed up with trying my own ways of fixing it that's when I will reach out to them."
07,2021-06-05,50,"Okay, it has taken almost 4 months and that's a considerable time for any person especially for someone who has bought new equipment and it's having issues, and luckily enough has a warranty. So how long will it take you to say it's a problem, let me consult the installers? What will it take?","From the experience I have had with the biogas digester, I think I will not reach out to them because it's improving. I see a massive improvement from how it was performing during the first months and now. The issue of gas pressure is slowly declining. For example, one time the bag got fully inflated and gas pressure was perfect, but I don't know if I was right or wrong, I stopped feeding it. Because, when the digester bag is full it produces what we call bio slurry so I was waiting for it to release more and more bio slurry so that it would create enough space for me to be able to collect more gas at the top and eventually increase gas pressure. Thus, I can see it\`s improving, and I don't see myself calling them because it\`s going to work."
07,2021-06-05,51,"But when it keeps on producing low pressure, when are you going to say enough is enough?","The change is not significant enough -- but I'm able to see the difference, and I'm sure it will pick up."
07,2021-06-05,52,Have you seen something like this (show table of interventions)? What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?,I think the information is good and it would help.
07,2021-06-05,53,How?,I think the information would eliminate assumptions and speculations. The information would help to get to facts and help users to troubleshoot problem easily. This would help solve problems promptly. And I think this information is better than going to the internet because it's clearly and specific hence easy to follow.
07,2021-06-05,54,(Laughs) what's the problem of assuming and speculating?,"(Laughs) they lead to wrong decisions and conclusions most of the times. For example, we might be saying our digester is producing low pressure because it is relative new. But, the opposite might be true. It might be that new biogas system produce high pressure (Laughs)"
07,2021-06-05,55,How would you describe the current state of the digester?,"I will rate it on a scale of 10. So, it's 6 or 7 out of 10."
07,2021-06-05,56,Why do you say its 6 or 7? Why not give it a 10?,"The problem is what I have already talked about, low pressure. Of course, it could be because we had or we have high expectation about it. It could be that we read wrong literature. As you are aware, biogas system come in different shapes and sizes, so it could be that what I read doesn't necessarily fit this one. As a result, what I get is not what I'm supposed to get. All in all, it's 6 or 7 out of 10 for me."
07,2021-06-05,57,Where do you get the information?,On the internet.
07,2021-06-05,58,"In your opinion, what has caused it to be in this current state?","Like I have said when you feed a digester with first feedstock, it doesn't start working on the spot; it takes time for it to start producing gas. For instance, it takes 3 or 4 weeks for feedstock to decompose and start producing gas. After that you feed it every now and again, so my think is that decomposition of the first feed didn't happen as it supposed to happen. It could also be we are missing something. Yet, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, because whatever Ecogen advised be, I do. Whatever information I learn on the internet, I practice. But like I said it will pick out because sometimes the digester produces adequate pressure like for 3 or 5 days or so. That's why I'm looking for harvesting bags to be able to store and use the gas when pressure is low."
07,2021-06-05,59,What's stopping you acquiring harvesting bags right now?,"It's because of financial problems. I have many projects running at the moment. But, I'm in the process of getting harvesting bag, like I have mentioned I'm searching for cheap things which I can use in place of genuine harvesting bags**.**"
07,2021-06-05,60,How much does a harvesting bag cost?,"I have never had a chance to ask, and I have seen people on the internet using tyre tube. So, I might use a tyre tube, but at the moment I haven't gone deeper about it, so I don't know"
07,2021-06-05,61,We are going towards the end; we have about 20% remaining. What will you do for energy it fails now? Or, **Interviewee**: I will go to Liquid Petroleum Gas because it doesn't harm the environment as firewood.
07,2021-06-05,62,"Sure, if it fails completely, how will you manage your waste?",We will just leave the manure idle.
07,2021-06-05,63,How much labour do you think went into building digging?,It was four people
07,2021-06-05,64,Masonry?,"It was 2 people. Of course, it's not complete. I would like to build a fence to prevent animals and children from encroaching to protect it as well as prevent human and animal injuries."
07,2021-06-05,65,Was there any other work?,"No, that was all."
07,2021-06-05,66,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,"I had prior knowledge about biogas digesters, and from my knowledge I don't think something like this can be made here in Malawi"
07,2021-06-05,67,Why do you say that?,"I don't mean if we want to we can't, but this one certainly wasn't made here in Malawi, and you can tell by looking at the digester itself, it's written manufactured in Kenya."
07,2021-06-05,68,"Okay, since you started using the digester, has the reactor save you money in terms of energy consumption?","I can say the reactor has not only helped me save money it has also helped me make money. Like I said, the reactor produces effluent that is used as manure, and luckily enough I have managed to sell about 120 Litre of effluent to farmers from within the community."
07,2021-06-05,69,How much does a litre cost?,"I have set a standard price, but I was selling 20 litre of effluent at K3500. And I'm sure I will google the real value of effluent so that I can set a reasonable price. But, before I do that I want to do an experience with the effluent. I'm thinking of having two pieces of land of equal size. I will grow maize on both, but I will apply effluent on one side and apply fertilizer on the other side. Then, at the end, I will be able to know the real cost and value of the effluent by comparing it with fertilizer it terms of yield. After that that's when I will know if K3500 per 20L is a good bargain for me or them, and then I will make a proper adjustment."
07,2021-06-05,70,"Okay, great. Okay, before the reactor, how much LPG gas were you using?","Initially, I had a 9 Kg cylinder, and then I bought a 14 kg cylinder after I bought the reactor. At first 9 kgs of LPG gas was taking about a month. Now, 14kgs of LPG gas takes about 2 months and 2 weeks. But, our plan is to stop using LPG gas completely, and I'm sure we will do it."
07,2021-06-05,71,We are going towards the end of our interview. We are remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas?,"I have a lot to say about biogas, and if I can say all of it would takes us the whole day."
07,2021-06-05,72,"(Laughs) I have the whole day, talk to me.....","Firstly I would say, if a farmer is serious about farming and wants to be productive he should have a biogas digester. He should have a biogas because he will be able to use waste to produce energy for cooking as well as generate manure which he can use as manure for agriculture purpose. Also, he will not only be able to use the by-product as manure, but he can also sell the by-product making it an income generating product. Also, cattle manure releases methane into the atmosphere which cause ozone layer depletion which has serious consequence on health of people including the farmers themselves. It's hard to envision this, but it has happens and it is happening. So, biogas is very crucial in alleviating environmental impacts, and we shouldn't be saying gas emissions from vehicles are the major culprits of ozone layer depletion, its manure waste which is the major culprits. So, as farmers, we should do our bit to reduce environmental impacts which affects us in many ways, for instance, it terms of climate change which cause prolonged drought which has serious repercussions on farming activities. Thus, every farmer should have a digester, and it's a must. In a society, not everyone can manage to have a digester, but most farmers can have one, so we should have one to help those that don't have the capacity to own a digestor to protect the environment. On the issue of reckless cutting down of trees and smoke emission due to use of firewood, such things are not easily to imagined, it's just like pouring one litre of oil into a lake, it still pollutes the water. Thus, when a person cuts down a tree or use firewood the impact it has on the environment is beyond measure. But, people don't know the magnitude of damage they are doing to the environment and to themselves by cutting down a tree -- They don't know that it's a chain, and it affects everybody."
07,2021-06-05,73,"Last one, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?","I don't know if I will answer your question as it supposed to be answer because it's a tricky one. If I'm given a chance to choose my own waste or energy intervention, I would choose 2 or 3 interventions. First, I would choose a system that is user friendly, not hazardous. Of course, I'm not say other intervention are hazards and dangerous, but a system that doesn't seem hazardous and has all the qualities I have said is biogas system -- whether it be a fixed domed or bag digester. So, personally, I would still choose biogas as an energy intervention as well as waste intervention. Also, I'm thinking of trying my own energy intervention, as you can see there; I have a bag full of plastic bags and bottles. I have collecting them because I want to build a system to be able to produce gas."
07,2021-06-05,74,"Ooh okay, how?","Okay, I don't have all the information, but I can share with you a little information I have so you can understand what I'm try to do. First you should know that all plastic come from oil. So, this technically means that plastic can be reverted back to oil."
07,2021-06-05,75,Okay how?,"There is a process called polyposis -- this is a plastic separation process which uses heat -- this means that you can separate plastic into 4 products using heat. It's a simple process that burns plastic in a reactor. Thus, when you burn plastic in a reactor it produces vapour. The vapour is then condensed and becomes crude oil. When you burn plastic in the reactor with little heat it produces petrol. When you burn it with very high heat it produces diesel. Also, when you are producing crude oil at the end system you can put an outlet to release pressure at the end of the tube; the pressure which comes out at the end of it is Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) which can be stored and use for cooking. Thus, the system produces crude oil which is petrol and diesel, and LPG. And also, the reactor produces char, the hard material from the plastic as a by-product which can be used briquettes for cooking."
07,2021-06-05,76,"Oh nice. I want to see your perspective of our study, our study like I said is trying to find out why many digesters fail, as a matter of fact, many have a very short life span. I'm thinking of digesters in Mulanje prison and in Chikwawa which completely failed in less than 2 months. What's your take? Why do you think many digesters fail or would fail?","I can't comment much on failures because I don't know the reasons for the failures, I don't know the design or the feedstock and all that. But, what I can say people are optimistic about biogas, yet we are failing because of a number of reasons. I feel money and investment is not a problem here, but people are lacking expertise and the information. Still, it's difficult to say why many are failing. It could also be that most people don't have reliable sources of manure so they are dependent on people. It's a real challenge, I remember I ran out of manure once, and I reached out to friend, but I was so disappointed with the manure. It was full of debris and sand that it wasn't good for the digester. I think the key to success is, having a good barn made of concrete so that one is able to harvest enough and quality manure for the digester, And also you have to understand that this is a new thing to many Malawians, and biogas is still in its infancy stage so we are still learning about the technology -- so with time we will be able to get things right."
07,2021-06-05,77,Thanks for the interview.,NA
08,2021-06-17,1,"Okay, where did the digester originate?","It was sponsored by Waste Advisors, who had a technician who came up with the design and everything. And we provided the place for the digester to be built, and also we provided supervision after construction."
08,2021-06-17,2,Do you know the actual name of this technician?,"It was Waste Advisors themselves but I can't remember the name of the person, and he is not working with Waste Advisors anymore."
08,2021-06-17,3,Who else funded the digester?,The funds came solely through Waste Advisors**.**
08,2021-06-17,4,"Okay, so how were you selected as a beneficiary?","At the time, Waste Advisors had already sponsored 3 toilets on our premises -- The Ecosan toilet, Tiger worm toilet, Urine separation toilet, and they were looking for a demonstrate site, and that time we had 20 cows, so it was a perfect setup for the demonstration."
08,2021-06-17,5,How did you know about biogas?,"I was familiar with it, and I have observed it in several places, and I desired to have it on our place. That's why I was happy when they came with the proposal that they wanted to build one here."
08,2021-06-17,6,"How did you come familiar with it, and where did you observe it?","I can't recall exactly how I was introduced to it (Laughs). However, when I was travelling in Europe it was quite common to see households having biogas from long ago, plus I read about it on the internet. So, I just thought it was an amazing way of using waste to produce energy. I observed one in Thete, Mozambique with a household there and it worked well. It was a simple digester. They used a septic tank, they had a water tank like 2500 or 5000 L in the septic tank, and the bottom was open. And they dumped all the biodegradables in the flush toilet and flushed it with faecal sludge into the bio digester, and it produced methane gas, and it would build up in the container, the pressure would rise and push the water out. Then they would just tap it off the top of that tap -- and it worked really well."
08,2021-06-17,7,"You said before waste advisor built the digester, you were already involved with them, like you had already worked with them on 3 projects. So, how did it all start?",[\[response inaudible\]]{.mark}
08,2021-06-17,8,What were your expectations?,My expectation was that with the cattle we had were going to use manure to produce energy to meet our cooking needs.
08,2021-06-17,9,"Okay, what were you told to expect from the installer?",We were told that we would use manure to produce energy enough to meet our need and in the process alleviate environmental impacts.
08,2021-06-17,10,"Okay, what kind of training were you given by the installers?","Actually, we had a technician who was dedicated to the process, he was the same person who was responsible for making compost, and he was trained, not me myself so much, he was trained how to introduce manure, how to stir the slurry. Basically, the process was supposed to work on its own long as it was being fed everyday primarily with fresh cow manure mixed with water."
08,2021-06-17,11,"So, basically one person was trained?","Yes, of course, I was there sometimes, but I was mostly occupied with other duties. Mainly, it was our then operator and farm manager, \[name redacted\], who was trained."
08,2021-06-17,12,"Okay, so after you were trained how to prepare feedstock, how prepared to run operate the reactor did you feel you were?"," Interviewee: As an organisation we felt that we were in a position to run the digester, and also the installer were around so felt confident to run it."
08,2021-06-17,13,"Okay, how did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? (I.e. cook)",We were using firewood on a rocket stove
08,2021-06-17,14,Where were you getting firewood?,"We were producing enough firewood from trees within the compound as the number of students was initially low. As enrolment increased, we ran out tree so we started buying wood from people around the communities. At the same time, we planted a woodlot but trees haven't matured yet."
08,2021-06-17,15,"You mentioned that you were using manure to run the digester, before the reactor, how did you manage your manure waste?",We were using all the manure for composting so we had no challenge in managing such waste.
08,2021-06-17,16,How many cows did you have that particular time?,We had 20 cows
08,2021-06-17,17,How did the system work after commissioning?,"It actually never worked despite us having all the cow dung required. It was so disappointing to see that a lot of money spent, though it wasn't our money, but with such good lay out of funds you would expect to get a good benefit from. We managed to get a little flame, but it never built up any pressure that we could even boil water with it."
08,2021-06-17,18,How much gas was being produced?,There was no way to measure it because there was no way to capture it in a bag or a container to see how much gas was being produced.
08,2021-06-17,19,what were other operation requirements?,It was primarily cow dung mixed with water.
08,2021-06-17,20,"Okay, how much manure was needed?",I can't really remember -- I think it was one wheelbarrow of cow dung every day.
08,2021-06-17,21,How much water did you add?,(Laughs) I can't really remember.
08,2021-06-17,22,Who was responsible for feeding the digester?,\[name redacted\]
08,2021-06-17,23,"\[name redacted\], Full time?","Yes, it is a small thing to do -- it's just put one wheelbarrow of manure add water and mix it with a stir. Then he would carry on with his other duties."
08,2021-06-17,24,"Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?","Well, when we first saw that the digester was not producing any gas with pressure, we wondered if it was not leaking somewhere. So, we actual emptied it and put a second layer of screed inside it. We plastered it over again -- it was a big job because it's huge digester. We had to hire a constructor to do all that for us to make sure that there were no cracks or leaks. And then we thought the outlet on top of the dome was leaking, so we could put water to see if bubbles would develop, but we did not see anything because it could not produce gas so something was wrong with the production of methane in the digester -- we could not get any pressure, so even if it was leaking we could not know it because you need pressure to see if there is any leak somewhere."
08,2021-06-17,25,"Okay, Did it meet your needs?","No, it never met our energy needs because it never worked. Like I said, we never used it."
08,2021-06-17,26,"Okay, what other challenges did you encounter apart from what you have already discussed?","We came to a point where we sold the cattle, the reason we kept the cattle was for chess production. But, it became evident to us that we could actual buy the milk cheaper than we were able to produce it ourselves. So, we sold the herd, after that of course it wasn't viable for us to feed the digester anymore because we had no source of manure on the premises, and to buy and transport manure with the experience we had, it couldn't work (Laughs), so we just abandoned it."
08,2021-06-17,27,No other challenges?,Yes.
08,2021-06-17,28,How long did you use it for before it stopped working? I mean how long did it take for you to abandon it?,"we never used it, and we abandoned it after 3 to 5 months."
08,2021-06-17,29,What did you do to try to fix it on your own?,"Yes, we thought initially, the problem was gas leakages, so we worked very hard to fix that. Then, we tried different recipes, we changed the input, we tried whey because we have a lot of whey water here, we tried to mix that into the mix, we changed some of the plumbing and so on. Because, initially we thought we would get a lot pressure out of it, we actually had a drum with water that we thought we would be able to filter out the impurities from the gas by peculating through the water but we never came to a point where it produced any, so we removed that, we just made the pipe straight to the stove but yeah, nothing could ever produce a flame."
08,2021-06-17,30,Did your call the project implementers to come and help? Did you call Waste Advisors?,"Yes, for sure. We called them and they tried different things, they suggested a few things but none of those imitative made any difference."
08,2021-06-17,31,"Could you please be specific with me, which things in particular?","Mmmh, I think we tried to faecal sludge at some stage, like I said we tried whey water. It was mostly, if I remember well, changing the recipe, that was the initiative that was suggested. I think at some stage, so we looked at the outlet where waste would be pushed out by the pressure to flow over into the chambers on the other side of the digester. We thought maybe the levels are not right, that was measured and be looked at again, the point of entry and point of exit and it seem everything was according to the design that should be."
08,2021-06-17,32,Have you seen something like this (table of interventions)? What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?,"Oh, yeah. Of course, we read up as much as we could about it because I wanted it to work (Laughs). Without Waste Advisors involvement we tried our best because it was of high interest to me to see it working. But, the deduction we made in the end was that the thing is too big -- it's the biggest digester that I have ever seen. And it required so much input that it was not possible for us to generate all that that input. If I would do it again, if I would have the opportunity to have a biogas digester again, I would probably start very small with just a 200 L drum and test my recipes, and until I see it is actually producing gas then I would increase the volume of digester."
08,2021-06-17,33,How would you describe the current state of the digester?,It's a white elephant
08,2021-06-17,34,"Ummhu, okay, what do you mean?",It's just sitting there doing nothing (Laughs).
08,2021-06-17,35,"(Laughs) how did it reach this state? In your opinion, what is the caused it to be a failure?","I don't know if it was the design because even when we had sufficient manure it never really worked. I actually felt the person who designed and installed it was not good enough. According to him he built digesters in Indian and places like that, but I felt his expertise was not there. I don't know what the problem was, but it was disappointing."
08,2021-06-17,36,We are going towards the end; we have about 20% remaining. What do you do for energy now that the reactor isn't working?,we are still using firewood on a rocket stove.
08,2021-06-17,37,"Sure, how do you manage your waste now that the reactor isn't working?","We have now less waste because we got rid of the cows. The waste we generate in the Ecosan toilet and worm toilet is not a challenge at all because we are always looking for source of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus to introduce in our composting systems. So, it\`s never a problem to manage our waste."
08,2021-06-17,38,How much did the reactor cost to build?,"If I can remember well, it was a lot of money, over a million I guess."
08,2021-06-17,39,Did you or your organization have to contribute anything in kind?,"We contributed oversight of the building process, and we also sourced the contractor, and of course Waste Advisor was just there to come every now and then to check if everything was done according to the design, and we provided the operator also."
08,2021-06-17,40,Who was the contractor?,"The building contractor was \[name redacted\], who we usually hire from the village."
08,2021-06-17,41,How much labour do you think went into digging?,"Eeeh (speak Chichewa) ochuluka -- Eeeh so many. Actually, we built the whole building with the soil that came out of that hole. We built a building of 36 by 6 meters using the soil, because the soil is ideal for making hydroform or soil stabilised blocks so we used all the soil to construct 3 large classrooms on the property so it was a lot of work to dig that hole."
08,2021-06-17,42," **Interviewer**: So, it was like 20 people?","No, No, No, it was just a few people. But they were really working hard. Maybe, it was 3 people who dug it."
08,2021-06-17,43,How long did they take?,(Laughs) now you asking me. It was too long ago I can remember.
08,2021-06-17,44,When was that?,Maybe 5 years ago.
08,2021-06-17,45,How much labour was involved in masonry work?,Maybe a team of 4.
08,2021-06-17,46,What other work was involved?,Maybe fitting of pipes and I was the one responsible for that.
08,2021-06-17,47, **Interviewer**: What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,"Nothing, excerpt for galvanised pipes -- fixings, and some of the reinforcement steel, I don't think it's made in Malawi."
08,2021-06-17,48,We are going towards the end of our interview. We are remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is amazing, I would like it to see it operating and working on our premises. I think it's a wonderful way of managing waste. Instead of producing methane on a landfill, you can rather produce it and burn it and cook something on it, so much better that to throw it or pile it that it can escape into the atmosphere as poisonous gas."
08,2021-06-17,49,"Last one. If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead (if applicable)?","I would choose a 200L barrel, simple system for a small family, and then I could experiment with different recipes. I would start with a 200L because I don't need such volume of waste to keep it going, and if that one works I could upgrade to a bigger system."
08,2021-06-17,50,"Thanks for the interview, that's the end, final remarks","Wonderful. You see what makes it stuck is, we don't have enough source of waste. I don't think it will ever work because it's just too big -- it's too big for our needs. It was designed according to that heard of 20 cattle and we did not foresee that time we would sell the cattle, now I don't know what to do with it. Maybe, if we could use whey or add something to it then it would work because we produce a lot of whey -- 400 litres. If someone can come up with a solution to use the whey in the digester that can awake the system because that's the only waste we are falling to manage right now."
08,2021-06-17,51,"like I said, we are looking at why many digester daily, so with the experience, why do you thing many are failing?","In general it's about management. I think a lot of people are not feeding the digesters adequately and with the correct recipe for the microbes to thrive and produce adequate gas. But, in our case it wasn't management, but the design because it never worked -- we need a specialist to figure out what the problem."
08,2021-06-17,52,Thanks for the interview.,NA
09,2021-06-22,1,"Okay, where did the digester originate?","It was brought here by BEAM, Beautiful Malawi Trust."
09,2021-06-22,2,Who designed it?,"I can't really recall the specific name, was it \[name redacted\]. I can't recall it was long ago."
09,2021-06-22,3,When was it?,"It was one or two years, I can't really remember."
09,2021-06-22,4,Who else funded the digester?,I believe it was Beautify Malawi Trust**.**
09,2021-06-22,5,Who built it?,It was that man -- \[name redacted\]
09,2021-06-22,6,It was one man?,"Yes, it was one man."
09,2021-06-22,7,What was your role?,"As QECH we simply identified a suitable place for the digester to be built -- close to the kitchen, close to the feedstock."
09,2021-06-22,8,"Okay, we have many public hospitals in Blantyre, how were you selected as a beneficiary?","They saw that QECH produce much waste as compared to other hospitals, so to reduce waste management problems at the facility they decided to build the digester as a waste management solution as well as an energy source."
09,2021-06-22,9,What was the selection process?,"I don't know what the selection process at Beam was. As for us, we were just told by the administration to welcome them so that they should work comfortably."
09,2021-06-22,10,How did you know about biogas?,"Of course, I just heard that pit latrines can be used to produce gas for cooking. But, when they came and installed it here, it was a whole different thing as it was using food waste and all."
09,2021-06-22,11,"Okay, what were your expectations?","We were excited because we usually need to cook food as quickly as possible for our patients, for instance, fast porridge for diabetic patients, or people on tubes so we thought it was going to help in those circumstances -- That's why we welcomed with warm hands."
09,2021-06-22,12,"Okay, what were you told to expect from the installer?","There was nothing we were told to expect. They just installed it. Of course, they were always around during installation. After installation, our expectation was that they would be coming to monitor, but they never came. We expected them to be coming to assist us on its functionality and also for us to ask questions to be conversant with the technology, but they never returned after installation. As a result, we were left frustrated."
09,2021-06-22,13,"Okay, what kind of training were you given by the installers?","No....... of course, we had a little training, so let me accept that we had training. We were told what to feed and what not to feed the digester. Number 2, on the digester there was something where there water converts I can't remember what, so we were told to refill the water once we see it was running out of water. And finally, we were taught how to switch it on and off."
09,2021-06-22,14,what type of waste were you told to feed the digester?,"We were told to feed biodegradables, for example, we were told not to feed stones and mango seeds. We were told to put all those things that can be digested and release gas. We were told to put this continuously so that it wouldn't run out of gas."
09,2021-06-22,15,How many were trained?," **Interviewee**: All the cooks including supervisors. In this department, we have 3 cadres -- supervisors, kitchen attendant and cooks. The responsibility of kitchen attendant is it distribute food to patients, cooks cook and manage food waste. Thus, all 3 cadres were trained."
09,2021-06-22,16,"Okay, probably, how many people were involved?",I would say 15 -- 20 people.
09,2021-06-22,17,How prepared to run operate the reactor did you feel you were?,"(Laughs) that's a hard one. I feel it was 50 -- 50. I feel what we learnt was enough to use it without problems. However, I feel the training didn't focus much on its maintenance so it was inevitable that when it failed we were not going to be in a position to fix it. Like I said, we were only taught how to fix it and how to feed it and all that."
09,2021-06-22,18,"Okay, how did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? (I.e. cook)",We were using electric cookers.
09,2021-06-22,19,"Okay, how did you manage your manure waste before the intervention?",We were disposing of waste in waste bins then it was transferred to where food waste is assigned to be disposed. But from there we didn't know where and what happening to the waste; whether it collected by waste pickers for pig farming or something.
09,2021-06-22,20,How did the system work after commissioning?,"Of course, it worked very well during the first days, and it had no shortfalls. But with time it started developing producing little gas. Unfortunately, it didn't work for long - it only worked for not more than a month."
09,2021-06-22,21,"You are saying it worked quite well during its early days, what do you mean? Can you elaborate on that?","(Laughs) when we switched it on as advised, it was producing gas sufficient for cooking, and food would get cooked very well."
09,2021-06-22,22,How much gas was being produced?,"The stove had holes where gas was produced and was burning. At first, all the holes were producing gas, but with time only 2 or 3 holes were burning, Of course, we knew it was because of a drop of gas production in the digester, and after time the stove stopped burning."
09,2021-06-22,23,"Okay, how many holes were on the stoves?",Around 12 -- you will be able to see the stove yourself.
09,2021-06-22,24,"Apart from cooking, how else did you use the gas?","There was nothing else -- we were only using it for cooking porridge, boiling water, Nsima for few patients and all that."
09,2021-06-22,25,"I heard that you were told to use food waste as feedstock, what were other operation requirements?","It was only food waste -- Cabbage, Nsima and all that."
09,2021-06-22,26,"Okay, how much waste was needed?","Of course, we were given a specify quantity. I think it was 15 Kgs per day, if I'm not wrong. Yes, it was 15 Kgs. We used to feed it every morning, and there was one chef who was very interested in it, he was the one who used to load it most of the times. And when we had surplus feedstock, we used to store feedstock behind the kitchen so that we could use it the following day."
09,2021-06-22,27,"15kgs of food waste, that's food waste the size of a 15L bucket......","(Laughs) it depends with the type of food waste, for example if it was cabbage; you need a number of 20L buckets to reach 15 kgs."
09,2021-06-22,28,"(Laughs) Okay, I see. So how were you measuring food waste?","We have a scale, so every time we were loading feedstock we would measure its quantity."
09,2021-06-22,29,"Okay, How much water did you add?","(Laughs) I can't really remember, but we were told to add water to the recipe."
09,2021-06-22,30,How did you prepare that feedstock?,We were simply breaking down food waste and then add water -- The person who is more familiar with this is on off today -- he could have explained better.
09,2021-06-22,31,Who was responsible for feeding the digester?,It was a chef.
09,2021-06-22,32,Only one?,"All the chefs, but one had a keen interest than all the other chefs. He said he was interested in owing one at his place. Just like myself, I was also interested in biogas because I wanted to install one at my house because it's cheaper and better than firewood as it can make use of fallen leaves, waste and all that. In truth, most people here were interested to see its performance so that they could adopt it in their house. But in the end it was a disappointment to everyone -- it was a flop (Laughs)"
09,2021-06-22,33,(Laughs) If it had performed......\...,"If it had performed well, without a doubt I would have ensured that I had one at my house because it seemed cheap and good value for money than firewood."
09,2021-06-22,34,"Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?","He did not talk about maintenance or who to communicate with in case of failure. The way he left was less like he was forced to come and install the biogas. The way I see it, he was just sent to do his work forcefully, or like he wasn't paid. I'm saying this because under normal circumstance, you expect an installer to train people on maintenance issues or at least have a maintenance plan, or leave a contact to communicate to in case of failure. He just left after the work, and he was never seen again."
09,2021-06-22,35,Why do say that?,"In my view, he was not paid accordingly. I think he had issues with BEAM that's why he stopped following up. He talked about building one at Chichiri Prison, and how it was performing. So, we expected him to be monitoring our biogas too and ensure that it was working perfectly in order to build a reputation that he installed a perfect biogas system at QECH. Unfortunately, after installation they never followed up - it was just like it was dumped here and a lot of money was lost in the process."
09,2021-06-22,36,"Okay, did it meet your needs?","Like I said after it was installed it worked perfectly well. During the first month we were using it whenever we wanted it, it met our needs."
09,2021-06-22,37,"Okay, what other challenges did you encounter apart from what you have already discussed?","The time it was working, we had no problem with it. But, after it stopped working it became a nuisance and made the place look unpleasant. And when we think about it, we wish it never came because it makes the place look unpleasant especially during rainy season as it cause water to stagnate and breed mosquitoes. As a result, it cause and increase malaria cases among patients."
09,2021-06-22,38,How did the challenge manifest?,"Like I said, after installation it was producing sufficient gas. However, after a little time gas production started diminishing, as if there was a hole somewhere that gas was escaping from..........What he could have done, he could have left us his contact to reach out to him whenever it stopped working. I tell you the biogas system was really important to us because it helped us to cook light food in a short time unlike when we use electric cooker as it takes time to hit up. So, when biogas was working we were able to cook porridge for emergency patients within 10 -- 15 minutes."
09,2021-06-22,39,"Okay, when it stopped working, what did you do? Did you call the installer?","No, we didn't call because we were expecting the installer to come and monitor the biogas, and see how we were managing it. When he didn't come to monitor, we reported to our supervisor that the biogas had stopped working. But, we don't know if he was able to reach out to the installer or to the hospital director."
09,2021-06-22,40,Have you seen something like this (show table of interventions)? What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?,"For the table of intervention like this to be helpful, one would need the installer to take them through the information for a month or 2 month. Only then, such information can be useful because to understand it vividly, you need someone to explain and to see first-hand."
09,2021-06-22,41,How would you describe the current state of the digester?,It's on zero (Laughs)
09,2021-06-22,42,"(Laugh), okay, what do you mean","(Laughs) It\`s dead. I don't think it will work again. Though the bag is still there, I don't it can work again. Some pipes are still in place, some are out of place. All in all, we have forgotten about it. I don't think it can be rejuvenated."
09,2021-06-22,43,"In your opinion, what is the cause?","It reached this state because of Beautify Malawi. I don't know what their objective was in trying to bring a biogas system here. We were using to using electricity for cooking, and biogas was a new thing to us so they should have ensured that we were well versed with the technology before abandoning it. To be frank, it reached this state because they wanted it to be this way. If they wanted it to work they would have followed up everything and made a proper monitoring plan to ensure that it was working and sustainable."
09,2021-06-22,44,We are going towards the end; we have about 20% remaining. What do you do for energy now that the reactor isn't working?,we are using electric cookers
09,2021-06-22,45,"Sure, how do you manage waste now that the reactor isn't working?","We dispose of waste close the eye department building, and there is a team that handles that. In some instances, people do come here to ask for cabbage waste for their rabbit and pig farming."
09,2021-06-22,46,We have done 90% of the interview; we are going toward the end. How much did the reactor cost to build?,I don't know how much money was involved to build the biogas.
09,2021-06-22,47,But you are certain Beautify Malawi paid for it?,"Yes, money came through Beautify Malawi."
09,2021-06-22,48,Did you or your organization have to contribute anything in kind?,"I don't think QECH contributed anytime other than land for the biogas to be constructed on. Everything else were provided for, cement and everything."
09,2021-06-22,49,How much labour do you think went into building digging?,"I don't know how much labour was involved because I was busy involved with cooking duties. Besides, we were only invited to be part of the biogas team after construction and installation of the biogas."
09,2021-06-22,50,What kinds of special items had to be imported from another country?,"I don't think anything else was imported. We were not told that some materials were imported. Besides, nothing looked imported."
09,2021-06-22,51,We are going towards the end of our interview. We are remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas?,"In my opinion, biogas is a feasible technology provided one is determined and committed. Also, biogas is very beneficial in terms of waste management as it facilitates collection of waste on premises. Also, biogas is a cheap technology to implement as it makes use of waste to produce energy, and lastly, it easy and fast to use."
09,2021-06-22,52,"When you say it needs determination and commitment, could you be specific with me on that? What needs to be done at institution level like this one for it to be feasible and viable?","Okay, when a biogas system is installed at an institution people need to be thoroughly trained about the technology, how to operate and maintain it, and also there must be a proper communication and monitoring plan to reach out to installer so that major issues that cannot be solved within can be solved by installers or experts. For example, let's take our electric cooker, there are some problems that we are able to solve within the institution, however, there are some problems which we reach out for outside assistance to help us fix the issues. Our cooker is very old, it was brought here during Kamuzu era, but because we know where to reach out when it has a problem we have been able to maintain up to this day."
09,2021-06-22,53,"Last one, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?","I believe any intervention would help this institution, whether it be solar or whatever. However, whoever brings the intervention should monitor and pay uttermost attention to the intervention to ensure that it's functioning. For example, we have solar technology, yet the installer closely monitors the system to ensure that it's working, that's why up to date those solar panels are still working."
09,2021-06-22,54,"Thanks for the interview,",NA
10,2022-07-19,1,"First question, where did this digester originate from?","The digester was brought by a certain man from Lilongwe. I believe he made an agreement with my boss to install it here. When he came here he advised us to dig two holes and place the digester bag in one of the holes. Then, we did put feedstock and add water in the digester bag, maybe around two drums (200 liters) of water. And now, we put water and feedstock in the digester regularly so that the digester produces gas for cooking."
10,2022-07-19,2,"So this guy who came from Lilongwe, do you know him? Do you know his name? And, did he come as an individual or a company?"," **Interviewee**: The man has a company.... I don't know the name of the company, but my boss knows the name of his company."
10,2022-07-19,3,I believe it's Ecogen. Did the man come alone or he came with his team?, **Interviewee**: He came with two people.
10,2022-07-19,4,"So, this digester was built by 3 people, the owner and his two workers..... Where did we money come from?",The money for the construction of this digester was provided by my boss.
10,2022-07-19,5," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay. So, during the construction phase, how many people were involved? I'm seeing three people from Ecogen, was there anyone else involved in the installation or construction phase?"," **Interviewee**: No, no one else."
10,2022-07-19,6, **Interviewer**: Should we say you did not support them in any way?," **Interviewee**: We only supported them in digging and placing of the digester bag in the hole. The rest of the work, for instance, fitting and assembling of the digester was done by the installers. So, after we dug and placed the bag we only observed, and they were explaining some of the things as they assembling the digester. For example, they told us how a digester functions, how to operate it, and how to make a digester produce more gas and fire."
10,2022-07-19,7, **Interviewer**: What did they say you should be doing to ensure that it\`s producing of plenty of gas?," **Interviewee**: The issue is about feeding - the digester needs to be fed frequently. And the other thing was that a digester works well on sunny days; on a cold day, it doesn't produce gas as on a hot day and the bag doesn\'t get full as you see now. But, on a sunny day like this, the bag gets full to a point that all of us here can sit on it and still not get deflated to the ground. Also, they advised us to feed it twice a week -- Mondays and Fridays. But, after using for some time, they told us that we can be feeding it three times \[a week\] - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, in order to make it produce more gas. They also told us that the more we feed it, the more effluent we would get at the outlet, and that the effluent can be as fertilizer. So, we use the effluent as fertilizer in our vegetable garden and for the flowers as well."
10,2022-07-19,8,"We\'ll talk more about the effluent as we progress, but for the time being let\'s focus on the digester. Apart from helping the installers in digging and all that is there anything else you did? What other role did you play?","That was what we didn't that time. Now, I basically ensure that it is producing gas on a daily basis."
10,2022-07-19,9,"So, what do you do to ensure that you have gas on a daily basis?"," **Interviewee**: We use food waste, for instance, cabbages, tomatoes, banana skins, avocados. And, there we have a mixer which we use for grinding the feedstock. After grinding the feedstock, we transfer it into a bucket and wait for some days to decompose. Then, we add 20 liters of water to 10 kg of feedstock -- if we fill a 20 liter bucket with feedstock, then we add 40 liters of water, and then we feed it into the digester."
10,2022-07-19,10,"So it\`s a 1:2 ratio. Uh, before the biogas came here, did you know anything about biogas?","As far as I\'m concerned, I did not know anything about biogas. I became aware of biogas when the installers came. When they came they basically mentioned that we would save a lot of things. So, after they explained everything, I was personally convinced that biogas is good, because with biogas you don't need firewood to cook, and also in the course of using it you conserve the environment."
10,2022-07-19,11,"It would save a lot of things, what things?"," **Interviewee**: For example, the time we lose in chopping and drying wood for cooking, and of course now, we are not cutting trees. We are only using waste for cooking; now, we are using food waste, dog manure and cow dung for cooking -- for sure."
10,2022-07-19,12,"So after the installers came, what were your expectations?","We expected to benefit from this because it's a good innovation for cooking. So, we expected that we would not be required to search for firewood for cooking, or spend money to get energy for cooking. So, we saw this as a free gift in a sense that the things we were throwing away, or gathering for city council to come, collect, and dispose, would be used for cooking."
10,2022-07-19,13,How else did you expected to benefit from this? Which things did you expect to benefit?,"We expected to benefit in terms of cooking, and I have to say this thing has made cooking easy, way easier than gas we buy in the markets \[LPG gas\]. The fire which digesters produce is more intense than \[LPG\] gas, which we buy from Afrox. So, I see that biogas is faster than LPG"
10,2022-07-19,14, **Interviewer**: How did you know about Afrox gas \[LPG gas\]?,"I came to know about Afrox gas \[LPG gas\] because before the digester came, our boss used to give us LPG to use for cooking. So, we are now able to differentiate the two in regard to cooking time because we have used them both. LPG takes longer than biogas. This thing requires little time to cook food."
10,2022-07-19,15,Which things do you normally cooking?," **Interviewee**: We mostly cook nsima. The pot which we use for cooking nsima \[hard porridge\] is huge and thick, and to use that on LPG gas stove it would take one hour -- from 12 to 1 o'clock. But, if we use biogas, it takes 20 minutes to cook everything."
10,2022-07-19,16,"Oh, that\'s fast. So, your main expectation was that you would be able to cook easily - is there anything else you expected?","I expected and saw this as a way of protecting the environment, of course."
10,2022-07-19,17,Can you tell me about that?,"I would say, normally, if you want to eat you need fire. So when there is no charcoal, you can't eat; when there is no firewood, you can\'t eat. Thus, if you want to eat you need to go to the forest and fetch firewood, or you need to buy charcoal -- you simply need a tree to eat. Thus, when we buy charcoal, it\`s less like we are encouraging charcoal makers to destroy the environment. So, we saw this as a good cooking technology that would protect the environment as it doesn't use trees. And, I hoped that it will lessen rainfall shortages."
10,2022-07-19,18,I'm impressed. How did you learn this?,"On that I can say I did not learn this from anyone else, but it\'s just how I perceive things. As you can see, we have climate change - the weather is changing unexpectedly, so I think we are having this problem, obviously because we are destroying the environment. For instance, when I look back to the time I was young and now, I can see that rainfall pattern nowadays is erratic. In the past, when the environment was intact, around this time we used to have showers and it's not happening anymore."
10,2022-07-19,19,How are you connecting rainfall and the environment?," **Interviewee**: I\'m saying this because we have plenty of vegetation during the rainy season. You can't have vegetation without rains. So, they are always connected in one way or the other, and they always affect each other."
10,2022-07-19,20, **Interviewer**: Where did you learn this or is anyone is supposed to know this?," **Interviewee**: There\'s nothing l learned from anyone. But it\'s just the way I think, and the way I see things"
10,2022-07-19,21,You expected this digester to assist in protecting the environment and at the same time to help you in terms of cooking. Is there anything else which you were told to expect by the installers from the digesters?,"There was nothing else excerpt that I expect this thing to last over a hundred year, long as we manage it properly. For example, we were told not to feed the feedstock with chemicals, for instance, we are not supposed to use dog manure from a dog that has been vaccinated for a period of less than a month. Also, we are not supposed to use or put soap in the feedstock or digester -- Soap kills digesters. We are not supposed to use onions and the outer skin of a lemon as feedstock too because they contain acids that kill bacteria."
10,2022-07-19,22," **Interviewer**: When they said this thing can last more than one hundred years, did you believe them?"," **Interviewee**: According to my experience with it, I can say it can last more than that."
10,2022-07-19,23, **Interviewer**: You mean all of us here will die and leave this thing functioning?, **Interviewee**: Jesus Christ in his second coming will find this and the people after will use this.
10,2022-07-19,24,(Laughs) that's a strong statement!,"(laughs) I\'m saying this because the system is able to flush out the liquids on its own. So, it's more less like it cleans and rejuvenates itself. But, if it wasn't flushing out the liquids, then I would have said it won't last 100 years."
10,2022-07-19,25, **Interviewer**: I must say you have great belief in this thing. Did you receive any training by the installers?," **Interviewee**: No, I did not receive any training -- But, I only received instructions. And, they said, if we follow the instructions, we will be able to use this for a very long time, and we will not desire to buy and use charcoal, LPG and firewood for cooking again."
10,2022-07-19,26, **Interviewer**: Can you elaborate on receiving instructions?," **Interviewee**: We can say they kept some information from us. They only gave us information regarding how this thing works. But, I feel like we were supposed to learn more, like how to disassemble and put the entire thing together, and how it started to reach this point. So, I think we were not enlightened enough, because they had assembled some of the equipment beforehand, and didn't tell us how to put the accessories together. But, when we saw some of the accessories, we felt that we could easily find them in the local markets -- so if we got trained on its assembly, I believe we would have been motivated to look for the other things and even be able to assemble or fix it too."
10,2022-07-19,27," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay. What kind of training did you require? I mean, in your view, how would you describe a training as a proper training for a digester?"," **Interviewee**: Okaaay, I desire to be taught how I can fix it when it malfunctions, but we were not taught how we can fix it once it malfunctions. Thus, when it breaks we have no choice, but to call the installers to come and fix this. So, I think it would have been proper for them to teach us how to fix some of the issues. Just like a car, when it is producing too much gas at the exhaust, we know it's the rings, so we just replace them. Same thing, they should have told us how to troubleshoot some of the issues, and then we could have been doing the rest."
10,2022-07-19,28," **Interviewer**: You know these people are in business, and I'm sure you know the success of this rest on maintenance and repairs. Why didn\'t you ask the installers to teach you things regarding maintenance and repairing?"," **Interviewee**: I must admit we made a mistake, we should have asked them. We were only asking petty questions. But, the good thing is that we still call them to ask questions and we can call them to come to fix some of the issues. For example, one time I observed that there water in the pipes, and when I switched it on, it didn't work because gas was not reaching the stove. When we called them, they said we should examine the pipes for water -- and when we found the water, they told us to remove the water, and when we did it started working again. So from that experience, I learnt that water blocks gas in the pipes of a digester -- So, this was like how a flush toilet works, they put water at the base of the bowl to prevent foul smell from the tank to come into the house. So in the same way water in the pipes of a digester blocks the flow of gas."
10,2022-07-19,29, **Interviewer**: What do you think caused that?," **Interviewee**: It's because when gas is passing through the pipes it drops moist which accumulates to water, and eventually it blocks the air -- I mean, everywhere gas passes, water accumulates over time."
10,2022-07-19,30," **Interviewer**: Okay, so what specific instructions did you receive?"," **Interviewee**: Like I said, we were instructed that we should not feed the system with anything which contains chemicals, because that kills bacteria in the digester. Also, the digester uses heat energy to produce gas, so when there are chemicals in the system, the water in the bag does not heat and boil to produce steam which is basically the gas use."
10,2022-07-19,31," **Interviewer**: Okay. Let me be clear on this because this is very important. You know for this thing to function for 100 year you need to know how to fix it. Why didn't you ask that time? You did think about it, or what?","We believe the instructions - We believed what they told us in regards to what they told us to do and not. And, we believed that if we follow the instructions, then the system is going to last hundred years. But, if we don't follow the instructions, then the system is not going to last long. So, we thought this will take hundred years, and the way we had seen it working, it can really last that long. So, the point is that we should not feed the digester with huge pieces of feedstock in order to make sure it goes get blocked or filled up."
10,2022-07-19,32," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay, I understand. In your opinion, why do you think your boss choose to have the digester here?"," **Interviewee**: Our boss saw that we were losing a lot of money in buying gas. In a day we only cook once, but still we managed to use one gas cylinder of LPG gas."
10,2022-07-19,33, **Interviewer**: How big is the bottle or container?, **Interviewee**: It's this big wide and this tall. It's not big.
10,2022-07-19,34," **Interviewer**: Maybe 4 or 6 kg LPG gas, so you used to use that in a month?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, and right now our boss is not losing any money on cooking. If he's paying for anything, then maybe it's only on water bills for the water we use for make feedstock for the digester. But, in regards to directly spending money on energy needs, I don't think he is spending anything because we are strictly using food waste as feedstock for the digester, which were previously disposing of and was city council used to come, collect, dispose of."
10,2022-07-19,35, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I learned about biogas when they installer came to install our digester here."
10,2022-07-19,36, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: We were buying gas \[LPG gas\]
10,2022-07-19,37, **Interviewer**: Do you use electric cookers?," **Interviewee**: No, no, we use LPG gas cylinders which we connect to a stove."
10,2022-07-19,38," **Interviewer**: And, in a month you were using one gas cylinder?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
10,2022-07-19,39," **Interviewer**: I think it\'s about 6kg -- We also use something similar at our place too. So, apart from LPG gas, what else were you using?", **Interviewee**: Nothing else.
10,2022-07-19,40, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: Before biogas we used to use the feedstock to make manure for our garden. So, after it came, we started collecting the feedstock, chop it up, and then use it as feedstock for the digester."
10,2022-07-19,41, **Interviewer**: How were you preparing your manure for the garden?," **Interviewee**: We had big tractor tyres which we cut open, so we used to gather feedstock in the tyres, and then add water. After some time we were getting the decomposed feedstock, and then use it as fertilizer for the garden. To make it efficient, we used to put worms in the tyres to speed up the decomposing process."
10,2022-07-19,42, **Interviewer**: So you were putting all your waste on the tyre?," **Interviewee**: No, it was only food waste. As for other waste, we gather it in a sack bag and then transfer it with that car over there to a big site where they make compost."
10,2022-07-19,43, **Interviewer**: When was this installed?, **Interviewee**: It has not been more than one year -- almost one year now.
10,2022-07-19,44, **Interviewer**: Do you know how much gas is produce?," **Interviewee**: Eh, it's a lot of gas - It's a lot."
10,2022-07-19,45, **Interviewer**: Can you quantify how much gas you get from it?," **Interviewee**: If the bag is full as it is now, we can cook nsima and side dish, and leave some gas in the bag. And, the next day, we will find the bag full. But this happens when we are feeding it more often. And, if we don't feed it, we find the bag as we left it the previous day. But, if we feed it again, the bag gets full again. And that's why in the beginning they advised us to feed it regularly."
10,2022-07-19,46, **Interviewer**: How often do you feed it?," **Interviewee**: It's not like I have a schedule. I just feed it according to my feeling, but in a week I try to feed it four times."
10,2022-07-19,47, **Interviewer**: How do you use the gas? Is it for cooking only?, **Interviewee**: We just use it for cooking only.
10,2022-07-19,48, **Interviewer**: How many people use it?, **Interviewee**: It's three or four people.
10,2022-07-19,49, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you use to start it up?," **Interviewee**: On the first day, after we had put water in the digester bag, we fed it with four containers of free cow manure. We used those black containers over there."
10,2022-07-19,50, **Interviewer**: The black container which is usually used for waste collection \[100 liters\]?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. Then they told us that we could start feeding it with food waste, dog manure, and any other biodegradable things."
10,2022-07-19,51, **Interviewer**: Like what?," **Interviewee**: We have avocado trees within the compound, so we use spoiled avocados as feedstock. So, when we gather all the feedstock, we grind it in a mixer, take out the feedstock put it in bucket, and then wait for it to decompose. After it is decomposed, we take it out and add water, and then mix it thoroughly before pouring it in the digester."
10,2022-07-19,52, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock do you usually feed it with?," **Interviewee**: After the feedstock has decomposed we weigh it on a scale. So, we add 20 liters of water to 5 kg of feedstock. If we take 10 kg of feedstock, we add 40 liters of water."
10,2022-07-19,53," **Interviewer**: Okay, how do you mix the feedstock after it has decomposed?"," **Interviewee**: At first we used to wear gloves and then mix it together, but we didn't feel comfortable. So, now we use something like a bloom for mixing the feedstock. And, when the feedstock is thoroughly mixed to a point where it's thick as yoghurt we feed the digester."
10,2022-07-19,54, **Interviewer**: I understand the green mixer or grinder has only been installed.," **Interviewee**: At first we used to feed the digester with large particles of feedstock, so our boss thought that we would fill up the bag quick and even block the system. So, he bought a grinder to breakdown the feedstock before it is put in the digester bag. For example, before the mixer we were even feeding the digester with pieces of avocados seeds. But now we grind the avocado to a paste and feed the digester."
10,2022-07-19,55, **Interviewer**: So initially grinder was not part of the system?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
10,2022-07-19,56, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to bring it after the digester was installed?, **Interviewee**: It came after 7 months.
10,2022-07-19,57, **Interviewer**: Why did it take so long to bring it?," **Interviewee**: We got it after the system got blocked one day. That day when we were pouring the feedstock into the digester bag the feedstock was not going in via the inlet pipe. Then, it took some effort to unblock it, and after that our boss decided to get a grinder/mixer."
10,2022-07-19,58," **Interviewer**: And, how did you unblock it?"," **Interviewee**: I told me boss about it, and he called the installers. They told us unblock it by poking through the inlet**.**"
10,2022-07-19,59, **Interviewer**: Where exactly?, **Interviewee**: You just need to see it; okay I'll see it at the end.
10,2022-07-19,60,Who is responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: I'm responsible.
10,2022-07-19,61, **Interviewer**: Is it just you or some other guys do feed it as well?," **Interviewee**: There are a few workers here, but I'm the one who mostly interacts with it."
10,2022-07-19,62, **Interviewer**: Why is it that the responsibility is basically on you?," **Interviewee**: That's a difficult question, but I will still answer it. I think the responsibility falls on me because I'm a garden boy, and most people views us a dumpsite -- people think we can literally handle anything. Sometimes the other workers refuse to handle feedstock because it produces foul smell. So, because I'm a garden boy they thinking I can do any kind of work."
10,2022-07-19,63, **Interviewer**: Does it produce foul smell?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it does."
10,2022-07-19,64, **Interviewer**: I think the things are always covered...., **Interviewee**: We wait for the feedstock to decompose before mixing it with water. So you know how decomposed things smell -- I'll show you and you will see how nice.
10,2022-07-19,65," **Interviewer**: Oh, nice. What were the maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: We just need to feed it with care as we were advised by the installers. For example, we don't need to feed it with items we were advised not to feed it with. So if we do that, then everything is okay."
10,2022-07-19,66," **Interviewer**: You have said you are the one who mostly interacts with it. If it malfunctions, will you be able fix it?"," **Interviewee**: If gas is not coming at the stove, I'm able to fix that."
10,2022-07-19,67, **Interviewer**: How do you solve that?," **Interviewee**: The system has a filter which looks like a steel mess wire scourer, so if there is no gas at the stove, we just replacing the filter. Basically, what happens is that, when a filter is contaminated, it blocks the flow of gas -- I'll show where the filter is located."
10,2022-07-19,68, **Interviewer**: That's so nice of you. What other problem can you solve?, **Interviewee**: I can only solve that problem. The thing is a digester is simple and very easy to maintain because it doesn't have many issues.
10,2022-07-19,69," **Interviewer**: If there is a leakage on the bag, can you fix that?"," **Interviewee**: If there is a leakage on the bag, then there is nothing we can do. So, what we do is we just ensure that there is no item around it that can puncture it."
10,2022-07-19,70," **Interviewer**: You have said you know how to remove and replace a filter, how did you learn this?"," **Interviewee**: They told us that when there's little or no gas at the stove there are two issues to look at. First, it's the issue of water log in the system. And, when there is no water in the pipes, then we should take out the filter and replace it."
10,2022-07-19,71, **Interviewer**: Is that not training? (Laughs), **Interviewee**: That's school indeed (laughs)
10,2022-07-19,72, **Interviewer**: (laughs) why are you saying there was no training?," **Interviewee**: We expected to sit down, take paper and pen like in a class, and then learn this thing thoroughly. (Laughs)"
10,2022-07-19,73," **Interviewer**: Yeah, you could have asked your boss to buy you pen and paper (Laughs). Does it meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, it's meeting our needs because we cook on it and eat daily. With LPG gas there were certain times we could not eat."
10,2022-07-19,74," **Interviewer**: Oh, so sometimes you could not eat because you ran out of LPG gas?"," **Interviewee**: The thing with LPG gas is we didn\'t know how much gas we had left until it was finished. So, when it was finished our boss would say we were supposed to inform him well in advance to buy the gas. The thing is when we told him, he needed time to go and buy the gas. You can't get LPG gas right away like Escom electricity token. So that was a challenge. Now we don't face that problem. And, when we face that problem it means I didn't feed it."
10,2022-07-19,75, **Interviewer**: What challenges are there?," **Interviewee**: The problem is that we don't get enough gas when there is no sun. But, if the sun is out, we don't have any problem."
10,2022-07-19,76," **Interviewer**: Okay, has it ever stopped working?"," **Interviewee**: No, maybe when we go for holiday. But, long as we are here it works. When we are on holiday, it just stays. But, then it's very rare for all us to be on holiday."
10,2022-07-19,77," **Interviewer**: So, it has never failed for a day?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
10,2022-07-19,78," **Interviewer**: What do you think of this kind of information, and do you think it would have helped?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, it's very important because it can eliminate the challenge of failing to solve a problem because of forgetting some of the information. So, if there is a problem we can only be rushing to this information, because it's like a manual book -- a book of instructions."
10,2022-07-19,79, **Interviewer**: So do you think you can forget some of the things?," **Interviewee**: As for me, I can't because I'm always interacting with it."
10,2022-07-19,80, **Interviewer**: Weren't you given something like that?," **Interviewee**: If we were given, then it's with my boss. I only remember our boss using a phone to teach us how to make and use bio-fertilizer."
10,2022-07-19,81, **Interviewer**: What did you learn?," **Interviewee**: We learned that to use effluent we need to dilute it with water in 1:2 ratios because it's very strong. You can't use the effluent directly because it can kill crops and plants, and it's even strong enough to kill termites."
10,2022-07-19,82, **Interviewer**: How do you use the bio-fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: We mostly like to use it in a place where there are termites. So, when I see flowers are not flourishing because of termites, I apply effluent. For example, this place we are sitting on was heavily manifested with termites, so I applied it here and all the termites are gone and will never return."
10,2022-07-19,83, **Interviewer**: What else do you use the bio-fertilizer for?, **Interviewee**: We use it as fertilizer for our flowers.
10,2022-07-19,84, **Interviewer**: Do you produce enough?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and at the moment we are keeping some which we hope to use during the wet season because termites are a problem around that season. And, they good thing is that we have a pump which helps us spray the effluent."
10,2022-07-19,85, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of our interview. How would you describe the current state of your digester?," **Interviewee**: I can say we have not used our digester even 25%. So, it has a lot of life and years to use it --I can't even say we haven't even started. I mean, we were given 100 years guarantee, and we have not used it for more than a year, so that's why I'm saying we haven't even started."
10,2022-07-19,86," **Interviewer**: You have said sometimes especially in the wet season you don\'t get enough gas, what do you do then?"," **Interviewee**: We just don\'t use the gas in the morning to make tea, so that we have enough gas around lunch time."
10,2022-07-19,87, **Interviewer**: What happens to the tea?, **Interviewee**: We use an electric kettle to make tea.
10,2022-07-19,88, **Interviewer**: What happened when it blocked?," **Interviewee**: It was only for a day and at that time we had already cooked. So, I was only feeding it to ensure that we have enough gas for the next day. When I told my boss about it, he called the installers, and they just advised us how to unblock it. So, we simply poked the inlet and removed a big leaf which had blocked it."
10,2022-07-19,89, **Interviewer**: Let's talk about the finances. How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: That I don't know but my boss knows.
10,2022-07-19,90," **Interviewer**: I think he mentioned something like K600, 000, and he paid money for it. Did you contribute anything in kind?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, for example, the pipes and drums because we have been upgrading it with all sorts of things. For instance, we collect water in the drum and tank, and sometimes we even put effluent in the drum, and then spray it in the garden because we have a pump."
10,2022-07-19,91," **Interviewer**: Interesting! We are remaining with four questions? You have said three people from Ecogen came to install it, how many people from your side to part in installation or construction?"," **Interviewee**: We did hire a builder, and together we dug the hole."
10,2022-07-19,92," **Interviewer**: So, who basically did the masonry work?"," **Interviewee**: It was the builder, and I supported him."
10,2022-07-19,93, **Interviewer**: What other work was involved?, **Interviewee**: Nothing else.
10,2022-07-19,94, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?, **Interviewee**: The digester bag and the membrane which protects the bag came from outside. As for other things like the fittings they got them in Blantyre Market.
10,2022-07-19,95, **Interviewer**: Do you know which country is it?," **Interviewee**: No, I don\'t."
10,2022-07-19,96, **Interviewer**: Why importing those things? Don't we have them here?," **Interviewee**: I think these things can be found here in Malawi. But, it looks like he is the first person to do this here in Malawi, and in my thinking it looks like he's working in partnership with people from another country, and he's the focal person here."
10,2022-07-19,97," **Interviewer**: Okay, do you think you are saving money?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, because before the digester we used to buy LPG gas and now we don't buy."
10,2022-07-19,98," **Interviewer**: And even the money you were spending on electric kettle that's also money. In your opinion, how much money are you saving?"," **Interviewee**: Taking everything into consideration, I can say we are saving K60, 000."
10,2022-07-19,99, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I can fervently say biogas is a simple thing, but very helpful. The only problem is that it's expensive and when I look at the money my boss paid, I don't think a person like me can afford it. And, now with how prices of things have gone up, and even if the prices hadn't gone up, I don't think I could afford it. So, I think biogas is for the rich, and not for the poor."
10,2022-07-19,100," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: Then, I can think of efficient wood-stoves, or windmill powered cook stoves because with that you can't be spending any money besides the installation cost -- And, you would only need to wind, and wind is always available. And with windmill powered cook-stove you can't be running around preparing feedstock."
10,2022-07-19,101, **Interviewer**: What do you think it hasn't come here?," **Interviewee**: I think people are just rooted to using firewood and charcoal, because that's what our forefathers told us to use for cooking."
10,2022-07-19,102," **Interviewer**: Thanks, that was my last question. Do you have anything to say regarding biogas?"," **Interviewee**: I would just say the people who have money should support people who are less privileged with biogas digesters, so that we can save the environment - We just need people donate these things in the communities, because, for example, if we can give these thing to 5 people, then it means we have save 10 or 20 trees, and in a year that's like 100 trees."
10,2022-07-19,103, **Interviewer**: That's true. Thanks for the interview.,NA
11,2022-07-19,1," **Interviewer**: Thanks for granting us an interview. So, we will approach the interview as you have said. \[name redacted\] will respond to questions regarding finances, and the rest of the questions \[name redacted\] will answer as you think that he is in a better position to answer the questions because he interacts with it regularly. So, without further ado, let us go to the question by starting with \[name redacted\] as she has directed. Firstly, how much did the digester cost?"," **Interviewee**: K650000 for the digest itself, and then I paid another K50000 for the wall building because we built basin around it; both at the outlet and the basin for the digester itself. And, recently I've added the greenhouse construction, but I think that should not be included in this question, right?"
11,2022-07-19,2," **Interviewer**: Uh, no. You can include it."," **Interviewee**: I bought the plastic for K50000, and then we put the frame in, I would have to check the cost, but it's probably another K45000 for the iron, and then one day labor for the guy who welded it, and then three days labor for the tailor who tailored the whole tent together."
11,2022-07-19,3,How much did you pay the tailor?,"The tailor got K22500, and the welder think got around K15000."
11,2022-07-19,4," **Interviewer**: Okay, how many people were involved in the construction of the digester? Did Ecogen only build it? Or, you had your workers as well?"," **Interviewee**: Ecogen advised, so they came for two days. Then, \[name redacted\] and two other people dug the hole. And, then we had a separate person at some point bricklaying. So that is, what are we now, four people? Yeah, four people with the advice from Ecogen."
11,2022-07-19,5,How many people came from Ecogen?, **Interviewee**: They came with a team of three people. \[Picks call and leave\]
11,2022-07-19,6," **Interviewer**: Okay, how long did it take you to dig?", **Interviewee**: It took us two days.
11,2022-07-19,7," **Interviewer**: So you were also responsible for digging, \[name redacted\]?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and because it was weekend, she paid me overtime... I do not work during the weekend."
11,2022-07-19,8," **Interviewer**: Oh, very nice (laugh). How much did you receive?", **Interviewee**: That time I got paid K10000 and the other people received K5000 each.
11,2022-07-19,9," **Interviewer**: So, K10000 for two days?"," **Interviewee**: That was for a day; she paid me K10000 per day, and the other people were paid K5000 per day."
11,2022-07-19,10, **Interviewer**: Why was the rate different?," **Interviewee**: She paid me more because I work here and I was overseeing the other people. Besides, I was person who brought the people here. Moreover, when I brought them to her she asked them how much charge her and they said K5000 per day. As for me I didn\'t charge, she just gave me the rate of K10000 per day. So in two days I pocketed K20000."
11,2022-07-19,11," **Interviewer**: Okay, how would you describe the job itself? Was it tough?"," **Interviewee**: Because we were many, the job turned out to be simple. Also, the place where we dug the holes used to be a keyhole garden, so soil was not compact as it had been tilled before. And, also because of previous watering activities, the ground was not hard. So, it would have taken more time and even more labor if those factors didn't come into play."
11,2022-07-19,12, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't know anything about it."
11,2022-07-19,13, **Interviewer**: So you were surprised to see the digester.," **Interviewee**: Before the installers came, our boss told us about it. She told us that the installers were installing the digesters to cow farmers in the villages. But, she told us that the installers were happy to install the digester here because they thought she could be exemplary to many, and that even people in this community would adopt the technology. Then, she told us that we would learn more about it from the installers when they come. And, when the installers came they told us about some of the things about biogas as they were assembling it."
11,2022-07-19,14, **Interviewer**: What did the installers tell you?," **Interviewee**: They told us the dimensions of the two holes. Usually, a digester has one hole for the digester bag and the other hole for the digestate. So they explained that when it is fed at the inlet the feedstock is flushed out into the other hole as digestate."
11,2022-07-19,15, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: We expected our work to lessen. Before biogas, we used to cook using firewood, so our expectation was that we would stop searching and using firewood for cooking. The other thing is that our boss is big on caring for the environment, so she was expecting us to stop using firewood, even the ones we were gathering after pruning trees within the compound -- she never liked seeing us using trees \[firewood\] for cooking. So, she chose to buy biogas because she wanted to save and protect the environment -- no one cuts a tree here, and that's why if you move around the compound, you would see a lot of trees. Therefore, when we got it we expected to save the environment. Secondly, we were so excited to have a digester to take away the burden of searching firewood in the wet season. Thirdly, as you know smoke cause a lot of health complications, so we expected protection from health issues related to smoke."
11,2022-07-19,16, **Interviewer**: What health problems do you have in mind?," **Interviewee**: It brings cough-- and the installers said that you can't say you don't smoke when you burn litter or use firewood for cooking -- so they labeled as smokers (laughs) -- they said smoking is not only about lighting up Chingambwe \[unprocessed tobacco\] or puffing cigarettes -- So, it mean that any type of smoke make people smokers. So, at the end of the installation we learnt so many things."
11,2022-07-19,17, **Interviewer**: Do you smoke?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I do not smoke. Since I was born I have never smoked, and I have never taken alcohol."
11,2022-07-19,18," **Interviewer**: How did you feel that you were a smoker, when you have never puffed a cigarette?"," **Interviewee**: It did not feel right (laughs). But, it is not bad as smoking a cigarette or something."
11,2022-07-19,19,\[question inaudible\]," **Interviewee**: So, we learnt many things. For example, we realized that some of the things, we thought were good were actually bad. So, without this we couldn't have changed some of our bad behaviors."
11,2022-07-19,20," **Interviewer**: Which things were you doing wrong, and got corrected?"," **Interviewee**: It is about burning waste. At first, I was okay with it, but now I'm not..... The coming of the digester has not only enlightened us but has also helped us in many regards, for example, cooking. Cooking on biogas is very easy and fast. The time we were wasting on searching firewood we now use for other things. As you know, we are given one-hour break at lunchtime, so it was not enough when we were cooking on firewood. So, it meant that we had to take some of our working hours from our boss. Thus, the time we were supposed to be working; we were busy eating or cooking."
11,2022-07-19,21, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: We got trained on its operation. Then, we learned about making feedstock, for example, how to prepare initial feedstock to start it up, and it's not like you feed it, and then it starts working, no. I remember this one took about a month to start up."
11,2022-07-19,22," **Interviewer**: So, you were basically told how to switch it on and off, and feedstock making?"," **Interviewee**: Sure! For example, they also told us the dimensions of the hole, and then make the hole, for example, they advised us to dig a hole of 90 cm deep, 250 cm long and 250 cm wide. They also told us that we needed to build a wall around it to prevent soil from collapsing into the hole as the soil was loose there since the place used to be a keyhole garden. So, we made a wall of 2 layers around it. Then, to start it up with we used 300 liters of water and 8 bags (50kgs) of fresh cow manure, which had no rubbish and sand because that blocks a digester."
11,2022-07-19,23," **Interviewer**: Did they teach you about maintenance, or how to fix some of the issues?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they explained that feeding is what make it block or not. So, they advised us to feed it with food waste, but to be careful because some of the things like raw vegetables end up blocking the inlet. Thus, after some time we made a round thing with hook like things. The equipment we made has no sharp edges because we didn't want it to puncture the digester bag; the thing enters inside the digester bag to gather things that could block the digester; we made this because at some point the digester blocked, and we managed to unblocked the digester with that equipment."
11,2022-07-19,24, **Interviewer**: How prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were?," **Interviewee**: We felt that we could run, and after we started using it, we got more confident because we started understanding it more. And, we have learned new things that we weren't told in the first place. For example, to minimize the issue of blocking by rubbish as well as sand, we soak feedstock and after sometime sieve it with our own made sieve and then we put the feedstock in a clean bucket. Then, we have also made our own funnel to ensure that feedstock doesn't spill over. And, also before feed it we keep the feedstock in a bucket for some time to allow things such as sand to settle at the bottom of bucket. Then also, we feed the digester gently and slowly so that the settled things should remain at the bottom. After that we get the remaining things like the small pieces of grass and use it for composting."
11,2022-07-19,25," **Interviewer**: Okay, why do you think she decided to build a digester there?"," **Interviewee**: She bought the digester to reduce LPG gas and electricity bills, as before the digester we used electricity and LPG gas for cooking. Thus, if we were using two cylinders of LPG gas, now we only use one. And, that time she was using an electric cooker, but now she doesn't use it. Also, before the digester we used to buy organic fertilizer, but now we don't buy the fertilizer anymore, we use our own bio-fertilizer. And also we were told by Ecogen that we could use the effluent as a pesticide, so now we are using effluent as a pesticide in our gardens. This pesticide does not possess any health risks, and it's possible to apply the pesticide in the morning and eat vegetables on the same day - something you can't do with inorganic pesticides, with such pesticides you wait for a week or two for the vegetables to be edible. But, this chemical is not hazardous, because it comes from things we usually eat."
11,2022-07-19,26, **Interviewer**: How do you make the pesticide?," **Interviewee**: First, we dilute the effluent with water in a ratio of 1:2. Then, we add ginger and pepper to make the pesticide stronger. Then, we pour the effluent in a sprayer and start spraying the vegetables."
11,2022-07-19,27, **Interviewer**: Who told you to add ginger and pepper?," **Interviewee**: Ecogen told us that we could use the effluent as a pesticide. And, we make the pesticide stronger by adding ginger and pepper. But, before making the pesticide we even saw that when we used the effluent as fertilizer, pests were moving away especially when the sun was hot. I believe it is effective when the sun is out because the heat facilitates evaporation of the effluent. So, when we made and applied the bio-pesticide, we even saw a greater effect. Previously, we had a big challenge of pest as we compost, and to prevent/control it we used ash. But, it wasn't that effective..... We have always been using compost as fertilizer, and ash as a pesticide, because my boss does not entertain the use of organic fertilizer or pesticides at all. So, even though it wasn't effective we continued doing that because it was an organic solution we knew."
11,2022-07-19,28," **Interviewer**: So you were told by Ecogen to add pepper and ginger, or it's something you thought by yourself?"," **Interviewee**: No, we were told by Ecogen again. They were like some pests are stubborn and can't be controlled by effluent alone, so to overcome them you need to add ginger and paper."
11,2022-07-19,29, **Interviewer**: Apart from using ash was there any other solution you were using to control/prevent the pest?," **Interviewee**: Ah, we were using a traditional method, thus we used to go line by line to kill the pest physically. But, it was very challenging to do this on big garden or where we had multiple gardens, because we were moving from one garden to another. So, the main problem was that pests where moving from a garden you hadn't been to a garden where you had already killed the pests (laughs). Thus, to control/prevent the pests you had to do this all the times, and you couldn't do other work, as you kept moving back and forth."
11,2022-07-19,30," **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? I understand you were using LPG gas and an electric stove, and even firewood, right?"," **Interviewee**: Our boss was using LPG gas and an electric cooker, because she cannot manage to cook on firewood. But, now she uses biogas as well. As for us, we were using firewood -- we couldn't go inside to cook nsima, you know how long it takes to cook a very hard nsima (laughs)... Now, if you are seen cooking on firewood by our boss, you get in serious trouble. The only excuse you can give is that biogas is not working, but other than that there is no other reason that can spare you. And, she would even try the biogas herself to see if it's not really working -- and, if she finds it working, you will get in very serious trouble (laughs)"
11,2022-07-19,31," **Interviewer**: Where were you getting firewood, like you have said you are not allowed to cut a tree?"," **Interviewee**: It's not like we need a lot of firewood because we only work during the day, so we only prepare lunch. Thus, the dead wood we get from the trees is sufficient for us. Sometimes, we use firewood from flower plants and trees after pruning. But, we don't prune all the time, it's only in May and June of every two years. So, after pruning we dry and store the firewood. Then, in the wet season we use the firewood for cooking."
11,2022-07-19,32, **Interviewer**: So you get all the firewood from the compound?," **Interviewee**: We get all the firewood here, and we don't buy anywhere."
11,2022-07-19,33, **Interviewer**: I can imagine that the digester has helped you a lot....," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it has helped our boss to save money, but, I can't say it has helped me save money, no. It has only helped us \[workers\] by reducing our workload (laughs)."
11,2022-07-19,34, **Interviewer**: Do you differentiate the taste of food cooked on biogas and on firewood?," **Interviewee**: No, the taste is the same. But, I can only say that biogas is faster than cooking on firewood. Cooking on firewood is time consuming because it takes a lot of time to find firewood itself, and even for the fire itself to ignite fully. While with biogas, you simply switch it on and then start cooking."
11,2022-07-19,35, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock before the digester?," **Interviewee**: We used rabbit and chicken manure to make compost. I have gone for compost making training before, so I know how to make good compost. So, to make compost we make a square thing made of bamboo tree, and then we put leaves and manure, and then sprinkle water. After that we start another layer with leaves and on top of it we put manure, and then sprinkle water and so on. Now, we don't use water and manure any more when making compost, instead we use effluent, and it's more effective than adding water and manure as it breaks the leaves faster. The effluent in compost works as manure and water itself, and it also facilitates the breakdown of the leaves. And, now since we don't use animal manure for compost, we solely use it for feeding the digester."
11,2022-07-19,36, **Interviewer**: How do you compare the two composts in terms of strength?," **Interviewee**: I haven't used the one made of effluent yet, but I'm planning to take the old vegetables out soon, and then I'll see how effective it is. I can't and haven't used it on old vegetables because it will not be a true reflection of the compost."
11,2022-07-19,37, **Interviewer**: Where did you learn about compost?," **Interviewee**: I have worked as a garden boy for 22 years; 15 years with the owner of this house who went back to his home country, and another 7 years with my current boss. They are friends, so I just moved from one to the other when he was moving. So, this other time my previous boss enrolled me in a compost making training at Chigumula \[Crown Ministries\], and also in agriculture training in Ndirande. I'm very keen in learning things; it's just unfortunate that I don't go with school."
11,2022-07-19,38," **Interviewer**: (Laughs) why did not you finish school? And, how far did you go with it?"," **Interviewee**: It's because of school fees. I only went as far as primary school. So, my English is limited and I feel like if I had gone far with school my boss would have done great things for me. School is very important, but I have just accepted that such is life -- we can't all have degrees. But, I only thank God that I have wisdom and an ability of remembering things. So I hope when I retire I will use the knowledge then."
11,2022-07-19,39, **Interviewer**: How did you know that you could use the effluent in compost as both water and manure?," **Interviewee**: I just thought that myself. When I was making compost using animal manure and leaves, it was taking 30 days. One time I tried to make compost using effluent and leaves to establishing the exact time it takes for the process, and I found out that it takes 20 days to break down the leaves."
11,2022-07-19,40, **Interviewer**: Doesn't the effluent go down the leaves since its all leaves?," **Interviewee**: Oh yeah, I put soil on top of each layer of leaves to prevent effluent from sipping through the leaves. But, I make sure that the soil doesn't contain plastics, rubble and other things."
11,2022-07-19,41, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: I can say since it was installed in January up to now, we have been experiencing cold weather, so we haven't been getting more gas. And, the installers told us that getting this season we would not be getting more gas like in summer because bacteria works well in hot weather."
11,2022-07-19,42, **Interviewer**: So you are still using conventional methods of cooking.," **Interviewee**: It's only the guards who use firewood because they come after we have exhausted all the gas. Since sometimes, we see ash around, so we assume that they use firewood. But we are expecting to get more gas during summer, and then we can have full information of its capabilities. And, someone was doing research and he asked me how much cooking time we are getting from this? I told him that it is difficult to estimate, because we don't track records of how each person uses it. For example, I can't know how much my boss uses it, or how the guards use it. But, we have decided that when the bag gets full to the maximum and reach its full capacity during summer, every user should be recording how much time he or she has used it."
11,2022-07-19,43," **Interviewer**: And, it could be that the guards use the firewood for warming themselves, and not for cooking...."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we can't know whether they use it for cooking or warming themselves because they come after we have left, and they leave before we come. So that's why I'm saying it's hard to estimate the amount of cooking time we are getting from the digester. But, once we start keeping records we will be in a position to know if we are using it for two hours or two under half hours"
11,2022-07-19,44," **Interviewer**: Specifically, when are you starting?"," **Interviewee**: When the bag has fully risen out of the hole in summer, I believe that everyone will be able to use it, so it will be easy to track its capacity. Right now, it is difficult to estimate because sometimes after our boss has prepared breakfast; it goes off while we are making our tea. So, we'll find the actual cooking time in summer."
11,2022-07-19,45," **Interviewer**: You have told me that you used 8 bags (50 kg) of fresh manure and 3000 liters to start up the digesters, where did you get the manure?"," **Interviewee**: We got the manure from Chikwawa \[more than 44 kilometers one-way\], and it was Ecogen that sourced it. Initially, we did find cow manure ourselves, but they said it had a lot of rubbish and wouldn't work. So, we used the manure to make compost. Basically, I was the one who prepared feedstock by just following their instructions. The installers couldn't be around because they said they had overstayed and needed to get back to Lilongwe to do other important things. Of course, we had 10 bags of fresh cow manure, but they told us that if we see the digester retaining the feedstock then we should stop. Then, after fed it, we waited for some time and the digester bag got full, and we were concerned that it would burst. After that, we started it and we were excited to see the fire. And, they told us that at the beginning we will be getting effluent but after some time we will start getting slurry at the outlet. Also, they said the slurry is a better fertilizer than the effluent."
11,2022-07-19,46, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?," **Interviewee**: We used tap water. But, my boss was concerned that we used water from the tap as it contains chlorine. She thought the chlorine would kill the bacteria in the bag (Laughs) -- and I agreed with her! Then, she also told me I think that chicken dung and food waste is the best feedstock."
11,2022-07-19,47, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: Because chicken manure and nsima leftovers contain a lot of bacteria, so it's better than cow manure and even rabbit manure. And, I agreed with her as well, because if you put chicken manure on maize, it wilts the maize. Then, I asked myself why it does happen like that, and then I thought it happens because of the bacteria (laughs). In the same way, if you can take cow manure put it on maize; it does not wilt the maize because it's not that strong."
11,2022-07-19,48," **Interviewer**: Oh it's strong. You have told me that someone asked you about how much cooking time you get from it. I wanted to ask you that question also, I just kept it, but it was coming...."," **Interviewee**: So as I said it is difficult to answer that question because it has different users and we don't track the cooking time. And, sometimes we find the stove going off whilst we are cooking. And our boss told us that if this happens we should go inside the house and use LPG gas. So, now we don't really know how it works, and we can't compare how it works in dry season and wet season. Thus, we can only answer how it works in the wet season."
11,2022-07-19,49," **Interviewer**: okay, do you use it in the morning?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, we do make tea on it. Also, in the afternoon we make tea. But, in the summer that's when we are planning to start cooking nsima -- now, we don't eat nsima at lunch. So, in the summer it would be interesting to see how much time it would take to cook nsima. But now, she uses it for cooking soft things, you know what whites eat. We have also boiled sweet potato there once, but it's always tea all times. So, that's how our cooking looks like in a day."
11,2022-07-19,50," **Interviewer**: The vice president in his campaign was promising that people would be eat three times a day, and you are only eating in the morning and afternoon is tea, what's happening?"," **Interviewee**: The thing is that the one-hour lunch break we get is not enough to cook nsima and clean the dishes. And, I talk with my boss that we should start eating nsima because the digester needs nsima waste to produce more gas, and she said she would think about it."
11,2022-07-19,51," **Interviewer**: Your boss is not always home, she's mostly at work. So, you mean 3 or 4 workers can't manage to cook nsima because of time? You can always share responsibility around that time.... What do you think?"," **Interviewee**: We made the decision have tea at lunch because that's what our boss provides us with -- we are not responsible for buying that! We get free food! So, if we want to be eating nsima then as workers we need to contribute money ourselves to buy maize flour and side dish."
11,2022-07-19,52," **Interviewer**: I see. So, if you are talking about preparing tea twice, then that's about 20 -- 30 minutes of cook time. So, I can estimate that you use it for not more 30 or 45 minutes a day.", **Interviewee**: Yeah. It could be.
11,2022-07-19,53, **Interviewer**: How do you use the gas? Is it only for cooking?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's only for cooking."
11,2022-07-19,54," **Interviewer**: My understanding is that you use the effluent for making compost or fertilizer, and for pest control. How else do you use the effluent?"," **Interviewee**: It's only that. But, just to add we have been using the effluent for vegetables like spinach, herbals, mustard, and strawberries and so on. Now we have bought a 2000-liter container to be storing the effluent for the next growing season, because we want to try it on maize too."
11,2022-07-19,55," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's nice. What are the operational requirements?"," **Interviewee**: The digester needs feeding everyday with 5 kg of feedstock. So every day I feed it with you chicken manure, rabbit manure and food waste from the house. And, in most cases I get food leftovers from my house too. My boss gave me two buckets that I have placed in a compound of my tenants, so I get a fair amount too. So, we feed it roughly 5kg a day, but that's the minimum. Sometimes, we feed it more."
11,2022-07-19,56, **Interviewer**: How much water do you add?, **Interviewee**: We use a ratio of 1:1.
11,2022-07-19,57, **Interviewer**: How many people use the gas?, **Interviewee**: We are six or seven.
11,2022-07-19,58, **Interviewer**: How do you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We get the feedstock and soak it in water for a day or two. After that, we mix the feedstock thoroughly, and then sieve the feedstock. Then, we feed the digester with feedstock without rubbish, and the remaining things we soak again for two days and use it as feedstock again but after sieving again. Then, what remains after that we use it as ingredients for our compost."
11,2022-07-19,59, **Interviewer**: Who is responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: I'm responsible for feeding it, but during the weekends my boss feeds it."
11,2022-07-19,60, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the task of feeding it?," **Interviewee**: The task of preparing feedstock is not that involving. The challenge I see is that it is not easy to source the feedstock. The other thing is that the feedstock produces strong odor that I find a health risk. I feel like the bacteria we need for gas production enters in our body as we are making feedstock; and it has the potential of causing all sorts of problems. So to avoid this I wear face mask and gloves every time I'm making and feeding it with feedstock. And, also when I get home I buy milk to drink."
11,2022-07-19,61, **Interviewer**: How did you know that milk could help you with that?," **Interviewee**: I learnt this in school. Though I did not go far with school, this one stuck in my head. So every time I am involved in any working that involves dust or strong smell, I drinking milk to clear out the dust or the other particles. Moreover, I confirmed this when I was working at Robray, a mattress manufacturer. Every time we were closing business, we they gave us milk to flush out impurities in my body."
11,2022-07-19,62," **Interviewer**: One big challenge in digester management is that what you have pointed out, the challenge of sourcing feedstock. And, most digesters fail because of that. How are you managing to overcome this?"," **Interviewee**: We are able to overcome this because it is not a lot of people who use the gas; secondly, food cooked on the digester does not require a lot of fire; and, thirdly we have livestock like rabbits and chicken; also because I am able to source feedstock from my tenants. So, it's like we have three sources of feedstock, and that's how we have managed to keep it running update. And, now I understand what Ecogen meant when they said it's for farmers. It really needs someone who has a lot of cows and someone who grows a lot of crops to meet its needs. But, now we are planning to buy more chickens because we understand that it produces strong feedstock. I also have chickens at my home, but the chicken coop does not have a floor. So, when we collect the chicken dung it contains a lot of sand. Thus, my boss has told me that she is going to buy a sheet, so that I can lay it on the floor, and come with the manure."
11,2022-07-19,63," **Interviewer**: Oh, she is so serious about it, uh?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but then it will increase my workload. But, she's nice and so understanding. So, I'll be okay."
11,2022-07-19,64, **Interviewer**: How many children and rabbits do you have?," **Interviewee**: We have 8 chickens, and 12 rabbits."
11,2022-07-19,65, **Interviewer**: How many people do you collect food waste from?," **Interviewee**: That's about 24 people, including my family."
11,2022-07-19,66," **Interviewer**: Okay, does the digester meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: Now it is not because we are in wet season. But, we expect it to meet our needs in the summer as the installers assured us that it produces more gas in hot weather."
11,2022-07-19,67, **Interviewer**: What are the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: We just made a thing like a coil so when we move it around the digester it gathers rubbish like grass, and eventually it prevents or unblocks the digester if it's block."
11,2022-07-19,68, **Interviewer**: What else apart from that?," **Interviewee**: It's only that because the main maintenance issue is the blocking of the digester at the inlet. So, when it's block, you can't unblock by hands, because a hand can't go inside the digester and remove rubbish. Thus, that's why we made that special thing for unblocking of the digester."
11,2022-07-19,69, **Interviewer**: What are the challenges?," **Interviewee**: It's only that it blocked once, and that it's not working well at the moment because we are in cold season. And, that's why she has built a green house over it to keep it warm. She just came up with that idea own her own, and it's not like she was told by Ecogen. And, sadly, it has a drawback too; it drops water onto the bag when it's hot. So, we are still trying out different things to make it work better."
11,2022-07-19,70, **Interviewer**: How did you know that it was blocked?," **Interviewee**: When we were trying to feed it, the feedstock couldn't go in."
11,2022-07-19,71, **Interviewer**: When it's blocked how long did it take to fix it?," **Interviewee**: I think it took one and a half week. And, it was after we came with the idea of making the unblocking thing."
11,2022-07-19,72, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to block?," **Interviewee**: We installed it in January, and it blocked on 4^th^ March or April, I think."
11,2022-07-19,73," **Interviewer**: Did you call the installers? And, what did they say?"," **Interviewee**: My boss called Ecogen and reported that the digester was not producing fire, and that it was returning feedstock as we were trying to feeding it. Then, they told her that it blocked at the inlet. Then, they asked us what we were feeding it, so the problem was that we didn't follow the feeding instructions, during weekends she was just getting rabbit manure, add water, and then feed it. So that's what caused it to block. But, in the end we learned something, and that when we started soaking it."
11,2022-07-19,74," **Interviewer**: It's a known fact that white people are organized and do not follow shorts, what happened that? Was she not told how to feed it or something?"," **Interviewee**: That time she fed it with raw pumpkin leaves from the hutch which easily block thing, because of the spines/white thread like things on the leaves, and also because pumpkin leaves don't decompose easily. She didn't know that it was a bad feedstock."
11,2022-07-19,75, **Interviewer**: Was Ecogen coming to fix this?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and even when we unblocked it we called and notified that they shouldn't come because we had already fixed it. That time they were in Lilongwe, now they have their office at \[Blantyre\]."
11,2022-07-19,76," **Interviewer**: Better, what do you think of this kind of information, and do you think it would have helped you?"," **Interviewee**: That's useful information and you have brought an issue we have raised to Ecogen. We have requested them to provide us with a manual. So with that will be able to know what's happening, and get guidance on how to react. For example, we are hoping to get information on how to make it better when it is summer or wet season."
11,2022-07-19,77, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of your digester?," **Interviewee**: I can't explain more about it because we have only used it in wet season. And, you know here in Malawi we have two seasons; the wet season and dry season; so I can only explain what we have seen in wet season in regards to its functionality as well as its props and cons."
11,2022-07-19,78, **Interviewer**: What are its pros and cons in wet season?," **Interviewee**: The one challenge is that it produces little gas in wet season..... The other thing is that it blocks. But, that time it was our fault because we did not feed it properly."
11,2022-07-19,79, **Interviewer**: Why are you making a distinction between wet season and dry season in regards to its functionality? Where are you getting this? Why do you think things will be different in dry season?," **Interviewee**: It's because we were told by the installers that in wet season it produces relatively small gas unlike in dry season. Now, we have decided to feeding it with 10kg of feedstock, we have started last week, so we are waiting to see if things will be different."
11,2022-07-19,80, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Personally, I can say biogas is a very, very good thing for a number of reasons. Number one is that it can help people save money by eliminating the cost of fertilizer in farming. I'm a farmer and I like to grow vegetables, so I think it can help me in this regard very much. I have two fields and I'm planning on using the effluent one farm to see how things will work out. I can't use the effluent on both farms because I don't know how it really works yet, so I can't take the risk."
11,2022-07-19,81,So basically seven people were involved in the construction of this digester. What special items had to be imported from another country?, **Interviewee**: They said they get the things from Mexico.
11,2022-07-19,82," **Interviewer**: Okay, what's the biggest change in your life now that we are using biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Now, I'm very fast in cooking, and I find it very easy to use."
11,2022-07-19,83, **Interviewer**: What do you mean?," **Interviewee**: It's in the sense that you only need a matchstick to light it up the fire\... And the other thing is that biogas can be used as fertilizer, so that another good thing about it."
11,2022-07-19,84, **Interviewer**: Where do you see biogas in Malawi 5 years from now?," **Interviewee**: The challenge to its progression is the cost. But, it has a lot of benefits. For example, if you use two bags of charcoal, which go at K12, 000, you can be saving K24, 000 per month and that is lot. And also, if you buy fertilizer at K50, 000, it means you would stop buying fertilizer. It also has the potential to save the environment because it can make people stop buying charcoal, then charcoal producer will not have customers, and eventually they would go out of business."
11,2022-07-19,85," **Interviewer**: You are saying biogas is expensive, but it is good. So to strike a balance, what do you think is a fair price for a digester for an ordinary person?"," **Interviewee**: when Ecogen came they told us that this thing can cost as much as K900, 000. But, they do allow customers to pay a deposit of K300, 000 and pay the rest later. I feel this is not feasible to an ordinary Malawi -- it's too much. And, that's a lot for anyone, even people living in cities. So, it's only fair for organizations to be giving this to people in the villages, and I think that way we can save the environment big time."
11,2022-07-19,86, **Interviewer**: Some organizations did what you are saying. They gave people the digesters but now not a single one is working....," **Interviewee**: Then, it has to do with management. I think a lot of people in the villages do not know how to manage things. And, from experience I think at household level this thing needs to be fed by one or two person to avoid mismanagement, and should have a proper feeding plan. I think with that this thing can last to 20 years if it's well managed as they said."
11,2022-07-19,87," **Interviewer**: Last question, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: Biogas is good but I found that it's difficult to own it because of its price. So, if someone can have it, and take good care of it, then it has a lot of benefits."
11,2022-07-19,88," **Interviewer**: You have said K900, 000 is a lot of money. What's a fair price for it?"," **Interviewee**: I just think the government or an organization has to provide the money. Then, if given to smart people, it can help a lot and save the environment. And, if I can get a chance to own one, I'm pretty sure I can quit my job and start focusing on farming right away."
11,2022-07-19,89, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) Thanks for the interview. Do you have any last words?," **Interviewee**: I am just excited for this interview, and that I have learned a lot from you."
12,2022-07-20,1," **Interviewer**: First question, who designed this digester?", **Interviewee**: \[name redacted\] from Mzuzu Universities designed this digester.
12,2022-07-20,2," **Interviewer**: Okay, who founded this?", **Interviewee**: UNDP funded the digester.
12,2022-07-20,3, **Interviewer**: How many people from the construction company came?," **Interviewee**: It was only \[name redacted\], who came as a consultant."
12,2022-07-20,4," **Interviewer**: Okay, who built this?", **Interviewee**: COPRED identified local artisan who built the digester.
12,2022-07-20,5," **Interviewer**: How did you identify them? What was the procedure, or you just handpicked?"," **Interviewee**: Oh, no, you know people possess skills, so we identify people with skills in septic tank construction because digesters are more like septic tanks. Therefore, we identified people with experience and the pedigree of constructing strong septic tanks that last for years."
12,2022-07-20,6," **Interviewer**: Okay, what was your role as COPRED?"," **Interviewee**: As COPRED, this was our second digester; the first digester, we constructed in Soche, but did not work. The first was a floating drum biogas, designed by a Japanese man failed - it never worked. So, to advance our agenda on promoting natural resources management, and to reduce the rampant cutting down of trees here, we thought about strategies aimed at protecting the environment. At the same time, we saw people here were cutting down trees carelessly and had a lot of cows that could help them use for cooking. That is when we thought of an alternative source of energy for cooking. Therefore, with our little experience we came with a plan to install a biogas digester here to save as a demo and as center of learning of biogas so that they could adopt the technology. So, in a nutshell, our role was resource mobilization as well as community mobilization for biogas with the aim of reducing unnecessary cutting down of trees."
12,2022-07-20,7, **Interviewer**: When was this? When was the digester built?," **Interviewee**: In 2011, that was when the initial design was made, and it started working in 2012."
12,2022-07-20,8, **Interviewer**: When was the first digester that failed built? Was it built around the same time?," **Interviewee**: No, no, that one was the built in 2010 with funding from [MEET]{.mark}."
12,2022-07-20,9," **Interviewer**: So this one you worked with \[name redacted\] in 2011 and it worked, nice! How did [UNDP]{.mark} select you as a beneficiary? Did you follow any procedure?"," **Interviewee**: We saw an article calling for proposals, so we showed interest and capacity that we could run biogas."
12,2022-07-20,10, **Interviewer**: Was the article in the newspaper?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it was in the newspaper."
12,2022-07-20,11, **Interviewer**: Daily Times?, **Interviewee**: Yes!
12,2022-07-20,12," **Interviewer**: I want to know, what was exactly on that article in that newspaper?"," **Interviewee**: You know there are opportunities for innovative ideas on conservation and protection of the environment. So as [COPRED]{.mark}, we thought of biogas digesters as an intervention that could help conserve and protect the environment, especially cutting down of trees. In addition, we wanted people especially with cows to adopt the technology to help conserve the environment while using their cow manure for cooking as well. So, when we built the digester here five people were using it in a communal kitchen, and in total, people were getting 8 or 9 cooking hours per day, so you can see that people were saving K12,000 to K15,000 which they were spending on firewood. Then, we thought that if five people or more could use the technology, then the use of charcoal and firewood would reduce dramatically thereby protecting and conserving trees. So, biogas was a byproduct of innovative ideas that we came up with."
12,2022-07-20,13," **Interviewer**: (laughs) it was really an innovative idea because for an organization like [UNDP]{.mark} to give you funds, it means you really deserved it."," **Interviewee**: Yes, it was."
12,2022-07-20,14, **Interviewer**: How long was your project?, **Interviewee**: It was for two years.
12,2022-07-20,15," **Interviewer**: So in two years you built this one as a demo and five people benefited from this, nice. Apart from this, did you build another one? Or did anybody built one?"," **Interviewee**: This one was a demo, and as you know digesters come in different sizes depending on the amount of gas one wants to produce and use - So this digester was strictly built for demonstration purposes. However, during that time, there was a certain man who had five cows and was keen on building a biogas digester, but he passed away in the process. Sadly, when he died his family did not show interest like the one he did, so it never materialized. So, to answer your question, this was the only digester we installed and no one else adopted the technology."
12,2022-07-20,16, **Interviewer**: Mmh.,"so had he lived, I would have been saying that one person adopted the technology in this community."
12,2022-07-20,17," **Interviewer**: Apparently, no one adopted your technology, and looking at you objectives, we can say your project one of your objectives did not to live up to your expectation. Why did people not adopt it? And, was there interest in the technology in general?", **Interviewee**: People from this village or other places?
12,2022-07-20,18, **Interviewer**: Anywhere.," **Interviewee**: We have had a number of people coming from Zomba, Ntcheu and even Nsanje."
12,2022-07-20,19, **Interviewer**: How did they know about you? How did they know that COPRED had a digester?," **Interviewee**: We had a quarterly meeting with UNDP partners at Grace Bandawe \[conference centre\], and we gave a presentation on biogas."
12,2022-07-20,20, **Interviewer**: Grace Bandawe in Blantyre?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, so when we made the presentation, people were very interested to learn more from us."
12,2022-07-20,21, **Interviewer**: Which organizations were present at the meeting?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) I cannot remember, but a couple of organizations were there."
12,2022-07-20,22," **Interviewer**: Before, you saw the article in the newspaper calling for project proposals. Did you know anything about biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, as I mentioned, before this one was installed here, we installed another one in TA Nsomba -- Soche, but was not successful. So, I learnt digester more about biogas from the first digester that was funded by MEET. But before that digester, I also learnt from people that, people use animal manure in digesters to produce energy for cooking and lighting."
12,2022-07-20,23, **Interviewer**: Who are these people? Who did you learn from?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I cannot certainly remember where I learned this. But, I think, we learned this from our executive director, who himself learnt about biogas when he went abroad, I think it is when he went to Kenya."
12,2022-07-20,24," **Interviewer**: Okay, so when you saw the article, and with your knowledge, you were like this is it?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they were calling for proposals on sustainable land management, so when we looked at sustainable land management in respect to natural resource management we thought of biogas. And of course, I believe there were many organizations that chose their own way of implementing sustainable land management - and also, it's not that in our project we had only biogas, there were also other components or activities too in regards to sustainable land management."
12,2022-07-20,25, **Interviewer**: Like what components or activities?," **Interviewee**: Like I said, the project was about sustainable land management, so we had activities like construction of control ridges, tillage generation, bushfire controlling as well as tree planting which were intended for reforestation purposes. We wanted people to plant fruit trees particularly, because after selling the fruits people are able to support their families."
12,2022-07-20,26," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were you expectations?"," **Interviewee**: We expected that after the demonstration people would adopt biogas technology. After that, we hoped that the people would stop using charcoal and firewood for cooking thereby conserving the environment particularly by reducing deforestation."
12,2022-07-20,27, **Interviewer**: What did \[name redacted\] say you should expect from the digester?," **Interviewee**: He was only here to provide expertise in the construction of the digester; and he was simply coming back and forth during construction. The last day he came, he just told us to feed it and wait for some time. I have forgotten how long he told us to wait for it to kick-start."
12,2022-07-20,28," **Interviewer**: Mostly, it takes about one month......"," **Interviewee**: Yes, yes, it was around 21 days. We waited for 21 days and after that the digester started producing gas. We had high hopes in him and his work because he told us he had constructed some biogas digesters in Zomba; and when he finished it really worked, and we were very excited."
12,2022-07-20,29," **Interviewer**: Nice, did you receive any training from \[name redacted\]?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, and that is why I'm able to explain everything now (laughs). If this was not done openly; if we were not involved in the construction work; if we were not taught how to manage it, then I wouldn't have been able to explain this to you now (laughs)."
12,2022-07-20,30," **Interviewer**: (laughs) yeah, yeah"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) He trained us and you can even appreciate yourself now; and that's why we were able to keep it running. On the other hand, you cannot learn anything through training, some of the things you learn through experience. For example, the digester did block once and we came up with ideas to unblock it. Also, one time, when we opened the valve, we did not get gas on the burner. But, when we pulled the pipes, we got gas on the burners, and after that we were able to establish the cause as well as the solution for that particular failure. We also learned that during the production of biogas the system also produces bubbles which sometimes accumulates in the system and eventually block the gas. Then, we would think of ways of unblocking, and eventually we came up with an idea of using compressors to unblock the digester (laughs)."
12,2022-07-20,31," **Interviewer**: (Laughs) yeah, yeah....."," **Interviewee**: so it\'s not as if you need to be taught everything, some of the things you learn through experience and adversity."
12,2022-07-20,32," **Interviewer**: Sure. So what kind of training did you receive? And, how many people were involved?", **Interviewee**: 5 staff and 10 community members; so around 15 to 20 people were trained.
12,2022-07-20,33," **Interviewer**: What was said during the training? What was the training like? How many days did it take? And, what type of training was it?"," **Interviewee**: During the training they mentioned several things that I can recall now. Firstly, he explained to us how the digester was designed and how it operates. Then, he talked about feedstock preparation, because if it's not correctly done, it turns the digester bag into a septic tank. He also talked about the benefits of biogas, which were pretty much the same reasons we decided to come up with this innovative idea."
12,2022-07-20,34," **Interviewer**: Nice, nice. How was this done? Is it like it happened in class or on-site?"," **Interviewee**: It was both; first, we sat in a class, and then we had a practical session. During the presentation, he also presented on construction of the digester because not all the people in the class training were present during the construction phase. So, he explained about the reactor, gas chamber, outlet and the digestate, brick wall and all that."
12,2022-07-20,35," **Interviewer**: Oh, Yeah (laugh), I can see you were able to follow -- and that he was serious about the training."," **Interviewee**: (laughs) He explained everything, can you come let me show you \[Stands up and goes to the site to explain the system\] Initially, we thought of making the effluent the floor directly to the garden, but later we decided that will not look healthy, so we made a reservoir there. So, this is where we were feeding the digestate, this was the outlet, and the reactor was here."
12,2022-07-20,36," **Interviewer**: Oh, nice, nice. After the training, how did you feel? Did you feel that you could operate the digester?"," **Interviewee**: I did not only feel like could operate it, but I also felt like I could even provide technical support to others."
12,2022-07-20,37," **Interviewer**: Oh (laughs) it was really successful training, I see...","Yeah, because he was simply directing. For example, he could just say; take the pipes and go to a plumber to put threads on the pipes; go to a welder to fabricate this and that, we what to do this. So, we were doing everything and it was more hands-on, and even the artisans were only provided with technical support and can pretty much do everything by themselves now - and it's good that we still have people who can build this around the community."
12,2022-07-20,38, **Interviewer**: You chose to build this one to conserve the environment as well as to allow people to learn and adopt the technology. You have also said you wanted to provide energy for cooking. Is there anything else that compelled you to build the digester here?," **Interviewee**: Firstly, this was a demonstration. We brought it here because at that time we had cows, so we knew that feeding was not going to be a problem, and as a learning center we hope people would learn and start constructing their own biogas digesters. Also, as you know, in Blantyre city, the cost of living is very high, price of charcoal is also high, firewood is also expensive, and when we saw that people here had cows, we wanted them to use their cow manure for cooking thereby helping them to money. So, we knew if we could make people use biogas, it was going to make them stop using charcoal and firewood which results in deforestation -- and when we considered the large number of people living in this area, we were pretty sure that a lot of trees would be saved."
12,2022-07-20,39," **Interviewer**: Before the digester, what were you doing with cow manure, and how many cows did you have?"," **Interviewee**: Before the digester, we were gathering the cow manure to apply it as manure for our crops and vegetables. Also, COPRED staff was coming to collect the manure for their gardens."
12,2022-07-20,40, **Interviewer**: How were your beneficiaries meeting their energy needs before the digester?," **Interviewee**: When you have nothing you always find a means to survive. But, it was very hard for them, because they were wasting money on charcoal and firewood, so this one helped them to cut their expenditure on charcoal and firewood. Also, as an organization, it helped us save money that we were spending on firewood to boil water for the cows to increase intake. Also, it lessened the work for our workers because it was really hard sometimes for them move around the community looking for firewood - so the coming of the digester helped us a lot."
12,2022-07-20,41," **Interviewer**: Let's look at its operation. In 2012, how did it work after commissioning?"," **Interviewee**: It worked well. There were no major issues like I said. We only started facing challenges when the quantity of the cow manure reduced, because we could not feed it as we used to. All in all, we had no issues and we can be able to say it was producing four cubic meters of gas. At that time, we were in partnership with certain organization called Sustainable something, I have forgotten its full name, and they were in partnership with Renewable Malawi, so the supplied us with a meter. That's why we were able to measure the quantity of gas it was producing per day. We were even able to measure how much gas was used for a specific time. Thus, in a day we were able to know how much gas was produced and used."
12,2022-07-20,42," **Interviewer**: Sure, how did the records look like? On average, how much gas was being used?"," **Interviewee**: I think it was 4.023 cubic meters per day, on average."
12,2022-07-20,43, **Interviewer**: That's produced or used?," **Interviewee**: That\'s used. It was very difficult to measure total gas produced because we did not have any storage. Also, it was difficult to gauge gas produced because gas production is continuously, and is used directly from the digester to the stove."
12,2022-07-20,44," **Interviewer**: Why didn't you buy storage? I mean, as an organization with funding from a big donor, did you see that a gas storage bag was necessary?"," **Interviewee**: The funds which were located for the biogas was not much, and even the funding itself for the whole project was not that much. I think the funding K12 million for the whole project, so we could not have done everything. It was very difficult."
12,2022-07-20,45," **Interviewer**: K12 million for everything, like trainings and other activities?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, the training, construction, other activities, buying of seedlings, everything."
12,2022-07-20,46," **Interviewer**: So, 12 million was for the whole project. Okay, how much money allocated to biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I don't have the figures..."
12,2022-07-20,47, **Interviewer**: What were they operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: There was need of cow manure, water and labor for collection and preparation of the feedstock. Labor was necessary because feedstock preparation is daunting, as manure contain trash that needs to be removed before feeding to prevent blockages, so it need special people responsible for that."
12,2022-07-20,48," **Interviewer**: When you talk of feeding digester, you talk of the initial feed for startup and regular feeding for gas production. How much did you use to start up the digester?"," **Interviewee**: Mmh, it was a lot, close to 10 to 15 wheelbarrows, and we added 2, if not 3 drums (200 liters) of water. After that we started feeding it on regular basis, and sometimes we did notice that when we fed the digester,, it could not take more feedstock as it was full."
12,2022-07-20,49," **Interviewer**: How much were you feeding it, and how regular?", **Interviewee**: We were not feeding it daily. We were feeding it every two days.
12,2022-07-20,50, **Interviewer**: How many wheelbarrows of feedstock?," **Interviewee**: There was no specific quantity. Some days they could put one wheelbarrow, but they would not put more than three wheelbarrows. Mostly, we were feed it twice a week, each time with one wheelbarrow."
12,2022-07-20,51, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add?," **Interviewee**: If it was two wheelbarrows of cow manure, we added 30 liters of water."
12,2022-07-20,52, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?," **Interviewee**: We had dug wells, and sometimes we could get water from the boreholes."
12,2022-07-20,53,\[question inaudible\], **Interviewee**: No far -- each source was less than 100 meters.
12,2022-07-20,54, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare food store?, **Interviewee**: We made a wooden stir for mixing the feedstock.
12,2022-07-20,55, **Interviewer**: Where is it now?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) we used it as firewood in 2014 (laughs). But, we did not lose everything, some of the things are in that kitchen. I think the stoves and some pipes are there."
12,2022-07-20,56, **Interviewer**: (laughs) who was responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: We had workers.
12,2022-07-20,57, **Interviewer**: How many?, **Interviewee**: They were two.
12,2022-07-20,58, **Interviewer**: How did you identify them! Were they part of the organization or something?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, the people who were responsible for managing the cows were also responsible for feeding the digester. We employed them basically to look after the cows, and when the digester came they had to manage the digester as well - and they were even took part in the training because they were interacting with the digester regularly. Therefore, leaving them would have made this unsustainable."
12,2022-07-20,59," **Interviewer**: Initially, how many cows did you have?", **Interviewee**: We had eight cows.
12,2022-07-20,60, **Interviewer**: What happened to the cows? Did they die or you simply sold them?," **Interviewee**: As I said, we were making losses because of diseases and treatment. Also we had issues with the milk; the cows could get mastitis, as a result, we could have issues with our milk buyers, Daily Board."
12,2022-07-20,61, **Interviewer**: What issues? Can you elaborate please.," **Interviewee**: They were saying our milk had low fat. They could talk about mastitis. Yeah, there were lots of problems."
12,2022-07-20,62," **Interviewer**: Lots of problems indeed. We are going to end of our interview. Now, let's talk about maintenance, what were the maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: As far as I'm concerned, maintenance requirements were concentrated on feedstock management as well as on periodic unblocking of the system. There was no need to wait for it block, to unblock it. For instance, after every three months, we were blowing the system with a compressor to ensure that it didn't get blocked."
12,2022-07-20,63, **Interviewer**: Where were you getting the compressor? Was it yours?, **Interviewee**: It wasn't ours. We were hiring.
12,2022-07-20,64, **Interviewer**: At what cost?, **Interviewee**: It was around K3000 that time.
12,2022-07-20,65," **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for maintenance? Was it COPRED, the beneficiaries or the installers?", **Interviewee**: The biogas was not UNDP's. This was COPRED\'s idea (Laughs\].
12,2022-07-20,66," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Okaaay, Okaaay...."," **Interviewee**: This was COPRED\'s and it's not like UNDP came to us to give digester. We sold our ideas to UNDP, and they were impressed, and funded our ideas. So, maintenance and even the identification of the consultant was not done by UNDP, it was COPRED\'s role."
12,2022-07-20,67, **Interviewer**: How did you identify the consultant?," **Interviewee**: You know it\'s a global community and we share ideas. The consultant had worked with one of our board members, and that\'s how we knew him. So, we reached out to him through our board member to come and help us with the project."
12,2022-07-20,68," **Interviewer**: Okay, great. Did the digester meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, there were no gaps..."
12,2022-07-20,69," **Interviewer**: But you had challenges, I'm seeing the problem of feedstock, Uumh? What were the challenges?"," **Interviewee**: The other challenge came when the people responsible for feed it lost interest. As a result, the quantity of gas produced decreased as well."
12,2022-07-20,70, **Interviewer**: Why did they lose interest?," **Interviewee**: It was all to do with the problems with cow management. The cows were getting infected with all sorts of disease, and the cows were not productive. I mean, when we went to Daily Board our milk was selling at a very low price. So, all this caused our workers to lose interest in cows, and eventually it also affected the feeding of the digester."
12,2022-07-20,71," **Interviewer**: But, this was your farm and they were your workers, you would have helped them in the management of cows, or you could have find new workers if they were the problem...."," **Interviewee**: It was not only them, even us were tired with the whole situation, and that's when we decided to sell cow."
12,2022-07-20,72," **Interviewer**: Another thing, who said you had issues with blockages. How did you notice the whole thing?"," **Interviewee**: There were times we opened the gas valve and switch on burners, but we could not get little or no gas - and we knew that the system was blocked.... We did put the gas valve and stove in a closed kitchen to prevent children from going in. We were afraid that children could go and turn the gas valve and switch on the stove and ignite matches and cause an accident."
12,2022-07-20,73, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to stop working?, **Interviewee**: It took three years.
12,2022-07-20,74," **Interviewer**: So, in that time the problems you faced were to do with blockages and feedstock. What other challenges did you encounter?"," **Interviewee**: Those were the big issues. On top of that, we had an issue with the stove. Initially, we were using a clay stove and it was not efficient. It was consuming a lot gas because we could not regulate the gas to the burners. So, when we saw that it was very inefficient, we made a modified stainless steel stove. Nonetheless, the problems continued because we didn't get the modifications right - The standard wasn't as good as a stove made in a factory. Of course, there was some kind of improvement. The modified stove was like and electric stove in a sense that we were able to regulate the amount of gas going to the burners with a control module. While, with the first stove we would not control the gas; we were on switching it on and off, and in the process having no control over output of the gas, hence we were losing a lot of gas at the end of the day. Also, we had issues with the pipes and the connections."
12,2022-07-20,75," **Interviewer**: So when you encountered all these kinds of problems, did you call the consultant? I mean, what did you do?"," **Interviewee**: We were handling all the problems ourselves. The consultant was only involved in the work before commissioning. We only called him when we were commissioning to ensure that everything was okay. Since then, we have never been in contact with him, and he has never visited this place again."
12,2022-07-20,76, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you call him to help you with the stove?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) the problem was not so big since we were still able to use the digester, and we felt that we could handle the problem. Also, when we considered the amount of money we could have spent on him, we thought it was not viable because the funds allocated were no longer there."
12,2022-07-20,77," **Interviewer**: uh, we have this piece of papers, with issues associated with the digesters, their causes and the solutions, were you given something like this."," **Interviewee**: No, we were not."
12,2022-07-20,78, **Interviewer**: What do you think of this information and do you think it would have helped?," **Interviewee**: Yes, the information would have helped to solve issues. But, then, we can't attribute the failure of this digester to lack of this information, because the consultant explained everything to us."
12,2022-07-20,79," **Interviewer**: ... And you had all that information jolted down on a paper, I guess."," **Interviewee**: Yes, and that information became our checklist."
12,2022-07-20,80," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay. We are going towards the end of our interview. How can you describe the current state of you digest?"," **Interviewee**: Since it's not working, I can say it's dead."
12,2022-07-20,81," **Interviewer**: Dead as dead can be? I mean, you have no hope that it can be revamped?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we don't have that idea now, and as you can see, we don't cattle anymore and the farm failed altogether."
12,2022-07-20,82, **Interviewer**: Why did the farm fail?, **Interviewee**: It failed because of the cows.
12,2022-07-20,83," **Interviewer**: We have talked several issues, but I would like to know how it reached this state. Also, in your opinion, what really caused it to reach this state?"," **Interviewee**: Because we had issues with cattle, and I believe that's the only reason we are here today."
12,2022-07-20,84," **Interviewer**: Now, that is not working, what do you think people who were using it as a source of energy i.e. cooking?", **Interviewee**: I think they have gone back to using firewood and charcoal.
12,2022-07-20,85, **Interviewer**: How much did the digester cost?," **Interviewee**: I can say K 1 - 1.5 million. In total, I can say it cost not less than 2 million; the cost was high because of the consultancy. It was also costly to build a cow house. Another thing was that, at first we made the design of the cow house to feeding the digester directly,. But, we abandoned this because the cow manure was containing a lot of trash, so we were worried that it would block the digester. So this is what made the cost high, but I think the reactor itself did cost us less than 1.5 million."
12,2022-07-20,86, **Interviewer**: And all this was paid by UNDP?, **Interviewee**: Yeah!
12,2022-07-20,87," **Interviewer**: We are remaining with four questions. So as COPRED, What did you contribute? Is there anything else you contributed in kind?"," **Interviewee**: We provided land, unskilled labor, bricks, and quarry stone."
12,2022-07-20,88, **Interviewer**: Let's put all this into quantities and costs... How much labor in total?, **Interviewee**: 3 laborers'.
12,2022-07-20,89, **Interviewer**: How much did it cost you?," **Interviewee**: Uumh, I can't remember the cost for all that."
12,2022-07-20,90, **Interviewer**: Masonry?, **Interviewee**: It was two.
12,2022-07-20,91, **Interviewer**: Did the biogas save you any money?," **Interviewee**: As I said, the coming of the digester made it possible for us to stop using firewood. So, biogas digester really helps. I can say, we were saving close to K15000 to K30000. And, it was not only helping COPRED in this regard, it also helped the people who were using it."
12,2022-07-20,92, **Interviewer**: Did you do an analysis to know how much they were saving?," **Interviewee**: No, but it was around the K20,000 to K30,000 per month."
12,2022-07-20,93, **Interviewer**: You said five families were using this. How many in total were you using this?, **Interviewee**: It's a lot -- more than 20 people.
12,2022-07-20,94, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is good but it requires adequate livestock. Also, it needs people who are committed to manage it."
12,2022-07-20,95," **Interviewer**: So, it's good, but it only requires commitment. What do you mean? Can you elaborate on that?"," **Interviewee**: I means, for it to work you need to dedicate your time and effort on cattle management because it's not about the biogas itself; it's also about cow management. Like I said, our digester did not fail because it developed a technical fault. It failed because there was no livestock. You cannot manage it, if you are relying on other people's cow manure, it\'s just not possible. It's not possible to run it when you are buying cattle manure too."
12,2022-07-20,96," **Interviewer**: Oh, you think it\'s not possible...", **Interviewee**: It's not possible you need your own livestock run it.
12,2022-07-20,97," **Interviewer**: Okay, last question, if you were to design your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: In terms of waste management, I would think of an intervention where waste could collected and transferred to a station in order to allow the waste to decompose and use it as manure afterwards."
12,2022-07-20,98, **Interviewer**: How can we develop such a system? And how can it look?," **Interviewee**: The system needs to have waste collection containers like garbage bags and waste bins in places where people dump waste, and from there the waste can be taken to a single dumping point, and then afterwards people can using the waste as manure in their farms."
12,2022-07-20,99," **Interviewer**: In regards to energy, what can you think of?"," **Interviewee**: Windmills, I think that's also good for energy source, I have seen something like somewhere in Chileka. I don't think it produce enough energy like electricity though. Still, windmills are okay, and also are good for water pumping."
12,2022-07-20,100," **Interviewer**: You had your digester in 2011 and in 2014 it failed after 3 years. In your opinion, what is your opinion of biogas in regards to the future of biogas in Malawi?"," **Interviewee**: Most people have not seen how it works, and I can say there is lack of publicity and awareness on biogas. I believe if there was enough publicity people would move away from electricity. People only think of electricity and firewood because there is no publicity on biogas. People are fed up with Escom - look at how Escom is failing to meet demand. If there were alternatives, who would opt for Escom? No one. So, if there can be enough publicity and if people see how this works, I believe people would adopt it, and abandon Escom."
12,2022-07-20,101, **Interviewer**: As COPRED you had funds and one of your objectives was to make people adopt it? Why did you didn't you publicize and create awareness so that people could adopt it?," **Interviewee**: We had the message but we rely on donor fund, so once the funds are exhausted there is nothing you can do. So need partners to beef in the support to help spread the message. On top of this you need to implement this as a model. The organization need to join hands to make this work by giving the digester to a small number of beneficiaries, so that other people can copy and learn from them. So, this thing to work needs money -- not one organization can do this, it needs organizations to pump in money and work together; without that this thing cannot work with funds."
12,2022-07-20,102, **Interviewer**: Last one, **Interviewee**: I thought you said the last one (laughs)
12,2022-07-20,103," **Interviewer**: This is the last one as last one can be (laughs).There is something we did not talk about it's about the digestate, how much was produced?"," **Interviewee**: The slurry which was coming from there we were dying because we couldn't use it for directly as it would kill crops because of its strength. So, we were gathering the manure for growing season, which is one year. Thus, at the end of one year we were gathering two Lorries of the truck you saw at our offices."
12,2022-07-20,104, **Interviewer**: How big is that?, **Interviewee**: It\`s 15 tons.
12,2022-07-20,105, **Interviewer**: That's a lot. Were you using the bio-slurry?," **Interviewee**: some people were coming to buy to use it in their farms, and we were also taking it for our personal use."
12,2022-07-20,106, **Interviewer**: This is the very last one (laughs). How much were you charging on the bio slurry?, **Interviewee**: I think one ton was K8000.
12,2022-07-20,107," **Interviewer**: Oh, thanks for the interview (laughs)",NA
13,2022-07-20,1," **Interviewer**: First question, where did this digester originate from?"," **Interviewee**: I just saw people coming with the digester. Then, they placed the digester in the hole, and then telling us that the bag produces gas for cooking."
13,2022-07-20,2," **Interviewer**: So you do not know them by name... I think this type of digester is from Ecogen. Uh, if you can recall, how many people were there?"," **Interviewee**: I cannot exactly say how many people were there. I just saw people coming with the bag. I think when they came they simply put the bag in the hole because at that point the hole was already dug, so. Nevertheless, I cannot remember exactly how many people were there, I think it was two people."
13,2022-07-20,3, **Interviewer**: Who dug the hole?, **Interviewee**: Hired workers?
13,2022-07-20,4, **Interviewer**: How many?, **Interviewee**: It was two people
13,2022-07-20,5, **Interviewer**: Who funded this?, **Interviewee**: The money came from the school.
13,2022-07-20,6," **Interviewer**: Who built it? I mean, was it only the two individuals from the construction company and the hired workers? Who else was involved?","It was only them; the hired workers dug pit, and the other people assembled the whole thing."
13,2022-07-20,7, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?, **Interviewee**: No!
13,2022-07-20,8, **Interviewer**: Um-hmm, **Interviewee**: I only knew charcoal - I did not know anything about biogas (laughs). I only knew traditional means of cooking -- charcoal and firewood.
13,2022-07-20,9, **Interviewer**: So you have not heard about biogas?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I did not know anything about biogas."
13,2022-07-20,10," **Interviewer**: Okay, what was your role?"," **Interviewee**: When it came, our role was to feed it every day, from Monday to Friday, to keep it running all the time."
13,2022-07-20,11," **Interviewer**: After the digester was installed, what were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: We expected to save money that we were spending on charcoal; I mean, once we learned that it produces gas for cooking, we anticipated to minimize usage of charcoal."
13,2022-07-20,12, **Interviewer**: What else did you expect?," **Interviewee**: We expected to save money that was being spent on charcoal, so we expected to use the money for other things."
13,2022-07-20,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, what things did you had in mind?", **Interviewee**: We hoped to use the money to buy relish for the students.
13,2022-07-20,14," **Interviewer**: When the installers had finished installing the biogas digester, what did they say you should expect from it?"," **Interviewee**: We expected to benefit... They simply gave us information regarding its operation. They said if we fail to feed it, we would not be getting enough gas and flames for cooking; and they said we should be feeding it. Secondly, they said the system produces water that clogs the pipes and stops flows of gas. Therefore, they said when this happens, we should be opening and removing water from the water trap, and then close it."
13,2022-07-20,15, **Interviewer**: You mean water flows in the pipes., **Interviewee**: Gas flows in the system
13,2022-07-20,16," **Interviewer**: So, where does the water come from?"," **Interviewee**: When the digester is not working or when there is no or little gas in the system, water starts accumulating in the pipes. As a result, it stops the flow of gas, and that\'s why we need to feed it all the time to avoid this."
13,2022-07-20,17, **Interviewer**: What is this water?," **Interviewee**: When there is no gas production like now, small traces of water accumulates in the system and then blocks the system."
13,2022-07-20,18," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay.", **Interviewee**: So that\'s the instructions we were given.
13,2022-07-20,19, **Interviewer**: Did you receive any training?, **Interviewee**: We received training on how to operate it.
13,2022-07-20,20, **Interviewer**: Um-hmm, **Interviewee**: \[Talking to students\]
13,2022-07-20,21," **Interviewer**: Okay, what type of training was did you"," **Interviewee**: We did not go in a class. They simply told us what we should be doing; and that if there is a fault, we should do this and that."
13,2022-07-20,22, **Interviewer**: Where was this training?, **Interviewee**: At the site of the digester.
13,2022-07-20,23," **Interviewer**: Okay, so can you remember what they told you? I mean, what is this \`\`do this and that, if there is a problem\`\` you are talking about? Can you elaborate on that, please?"," **Interviewee**: OK, if it's a broken like it is right now, we just need to inform them. The digester is broken right now because of pressure; we failed to harvest the gas for a couple of days, so the gas accumulated in the bag that the pressure was too much and ended up damaging the pipe close to the gas valve, which is close to the bag. However, for problems related to gas production, we simply take out the water from the water trap. In addition, when there is little or no gas we simply need to feed it, so that it can produce gas."
13,2022-07-20,24, **Interviewer**: Were you taught how to disassemble it?," **Interviewee**: Yes, we were told"
13,2022-07-20,25," **Interviewer**: Oh, what were you told?"," **Interviewee**: We have tools and in some places, we use our hands like to remove water from the water traps and replace."
13,2022-07-20,26, **Interviewer**: How many people attended this training?, **Interviewee**: It was my friend and I.
13,2022-07-20,27, **Interviewer**: You and your friend?, **Interviewee**: Yeah - the chef and I. She is not here now; she has knocked off.
13,2022-07-20,28, **Interviewer**: Which problems do you feel you can manage to fix?," **Interviewee**: When there is water in the system, I can manage to remove it, even when my colleague is not around."
13,2022-07-20,29, **Interviewer**: How?," **Interviewee**: When there is water in the pipes, the water stops at the water trap or at a place close to stove, the place I showed you. So, I'm able to remove the water in the system in these places even when my colleague is not available. I simply untie that place and that place too, and then I lift or hit the pipes, so that water backflows in the pipes into the bag or at the water trap."
13,2022-07-20,30," **Interviewer**: So, you are confident that you can remove water from the system when it blocks?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it\`s just those two places. But, in most cases, water is trapped on that place because it's difficult to get to that place as it is raised. Therefore, when it blocks, we open the water trap first and then we remove all the water from there \[where you colleagues is taking a picture\]"
13,2022-07-20,31," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's impressive. Can you manage to fix a leakage or a punch on the bag?"," **Interviewee**: If someone can teach us, we can do it. I do harvest gas from the system when there is too much bag in the system for later use; I manage to do that as well."
13,2022-07-20,32, **Interviewer**: So you were taught how to do that?, **Interviewee**: They told taught us how harvest and store gas; so we can do it; we harvest gas at the stove in the kitchen.
13,2022-07-20,33, **Interviewer**: How do you do that?," **Interviewee**: The storage bag has pipe or opening. So, when we want to harvest gas, we open the gas and connect a pump that uses solar power to help the gas move when there\'s little pleasure. In other cases, we just put a bag of sand to increase pressure instead of the pump."
13,2022-07-20,34, **Interviewer**: Let me be clear on how you harvest gas at the stove. How do you do that?," **Interviewee**: First, we open the gas valve, and then we connect a pump to the storage bag and the digester bag. The pump helps to draw gas from the digester to the storage bag. So, when there is little pressure we connect the pump to electricity or solar, and then it moves the gas from the digester bag to the storage gas. Some time, instead of the pump, we simply put a bag of sand on the digester bag to help move the gas from the digester to the storage bag."
13,2022-07-20,35, **Interviewer**: How does it look like? I mean can I see it?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I can say the pumping device looks like an adapter, and we connect it to solar or electricity to work. You can't see it now because it\`s in the stores room and its locked now."
13,2022-07-20,36, **Interviewer**: I would like to see this device. How many storage bags do you have?, **Interviewee**: We have two bags.
13,2022-07-20,37, **Interviewer**: How big?, **Interviewee**: Like this \[show height\]
13,2022-07-20,38, **Interviewer**: 2 meters," **Interviewee**: It is big and when it is fed, it gets big as that drum \[Points to a 200-liter drum). And, during holidays, I like to take the bags home and use the gas for cooking."
13,2022-07-20,39, **Interviewer**: Do you have biogas at your place?,"No, I just take a stove from this place and use the gas from storage bags. So, I do not need a cylinder or a gas canister, the storage bag contains the gas, which are using on the stove for cooking."
13,2022-07-20,40," **Interviewer**: So after all the training or the instructions, how prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were?"," **Interviewee**: \[speaks to students\] I felt very good, very positive indeed."
13,2022-07-20,41, **Interviewer**: Did you feel you could fix all the problems?," **Interviewee**: Yes, but we cannot fix the problem we have now; we need the installers to come and fix the problem. After that, we will feed and it will start working again."
13,2022-07-20,42," **Interviewer**: But, after the training, you felt you would operate and maintain it...", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
13,2022-07-20,43, **Interviewer**: Did you imagine a problem that you could not solve?," **Interviewee**: No... But, yes, because the installer told us that if there is any issue beyond our capacity we call them to come and fix."
13,2022-07-20,44, **Interviewer**: What problems did you encounter that you required consultation?," **Interviewee**: During the first days, when we were not conversant with the digesters, it was starting and stopping. It was confusing; we would try hard to troubleshoot as much as we could. Then, we realized that it required constant feeding."
13,2022-07-20,45, **Interviewer**: Why do you think chose to build it here?, **Interviewee**: \[student comes\] Can I attend to that one please?
13,2022-07-20,46," **Interviewer**: Yeah, yeah, I will pause the recording. \[After some time\] where were we?", **Interviewee**: We were on why did we choose to build it here?
13,2022-07-20,47, **Interviewer**: Oh yeah.," **Interviewee**: It came here to help us with cooking as well as to save money, which we were spent on cooking. It also came here to conserve the environment."
13,2022-07-20,48," **Interviewer**: Before the digester, what were you using for energy i.e. cooking?", **Interviewee**: We were simply using charcoal.
13,2022-07-20,49, **Interviewer**: No firewood?," **Interviewee**: No firewood, just charcoal."
13,2022-07-20,50," **Interviewer**: In a month, how much charcoal were you using?"," **Interviewee**: In a month, we were using probably three bags of charcoal."
13,2022-07-20,51, **Interviewer**: Are the bags not too little for the whole school? Is it not a boarding school?, **Interviewee**: It's not a boarding school and some students bring food from their respective homes. Some just buy junky foods.
13,2022-07-20,52, **Interviewer**: What do you cook?," **Interviewee**: Chips, eggs."
13,2022-07-20,53," **Interviewer**: and you were only using charcoal? I mean, most people I have seen selling chips use firewood; they say customer like chips cooked on firewood, and it's true the chips tastes better."," **Interviewee**: Sometimes, we could use it, but it was rarely because it involves heavy cutting of trees as a result it causes deforestation; besides, it's tough to gather firewood."
13,2022-07-20,54, **Interviewer**: Charcoal doesn't cause deforestation?, **Interviewee**: It does.
13,2022-07-20,55," **Interviewer**: So, how is it different?"," **Interviewee**: I just don't like seeing people cutting down trees to use as firewood, and it is also tiresome."
13,2022-07-20,56," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Okay, let's move on. What was your feedstock?"," **Interviewee**: Potato peels, slices of cabbage. And, they advised us not to feed hard stuff like maize cobs and stones; we were feeding it with things that easily break and decompose."
13,2022-07-20,57," **Interviewer**: So, it was a strictly food waste?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, food waste strictly, and no papers."
13,2022-07-20,58," **Interviewer**: Sure. Before the digester, what were you doing with the food waste?", **Interviewee**: We were simply throwing away the food waste in a bin.
13,2022-07-20,59," **Interviewer**: So after the digester, that's when you started using food waste productively?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we were not able to cook and serve food using food leftovers."
13,2022-07-20,60, **Interviewer**: When was built it?," **Interviewee**: 2021, or late 2020."
13,2022-07-20,61," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did it work after commissioning?"," **Interviewee**: After we installed it, we tried it with one banner, and it worked. But, before that, we waited for some weeks to start up. Then after that, we started using it for cooking."
13,2022-07-20,62, **Interviewer**: How many weeks did you wait?, **Interviewee**: I think it was two or three weeks
13,2022-07-20,63," **Interviewer**: So after those weeks, how did it work?", **Interviewee**: It worked very well.
13,2022-07-20,64, **Interviewer**: What do you mean?," **Interviewee**: The gas was strong and it was far more powerful than charcoal; the flames were intense and blue. It was easy to cook too as we were using two burners; so we were cooking fast, and then we would turn it off."
13,2022-07-20,65," **Interviewer**: How much gas did it produce? I mean, how much cooking time did you get?"," **Interviewee**: Maybe, we were getting one hour and 30 minutes of cooking time. And, if we were cooking beef, we could use it for two hours."
13,2022-07-20,66," **Interviewer**: How many times were you using it in a day? Were you able to prepare breakfast, lunch, and supper?"," **Interviewee**: We prepare breakfast and lunch, which we prepare around 11 AM. So, after that, we were done for the day; we finished cooking after preparing lunch."
13,2022-07-20,67, **Interviewer**: What food items were you cooking on it?," **Interviewee**: Rice, chicken, vegetables, and beef. The beef was the one that taking longer than the rest."
13,2022-07-20,68," **Interviewer**: So after cooking lunch at around 11:00 AM, were you not using it afterwards?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
13,2022-07-20,69," **Interviewer**: So, you were getting about two hours of cooking time a day?", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
13,2022-07-20,70, **Interviewer**: How many students are here?, **Interviewee**: Many - over 500 students.
13,2022-07-20,71, **Interviewer**: You mentioned that not all the students eat here; some bring their own food; some buy junk foods. Approximately how many customers do you have?, **Interviewee**: I sell food to 30 or 50 students per day
13,2022-07-20,72," **Interviewer**: What did you start it the digester with? And, where did you get the feedstock?"," **Interviewee**: I think we used a half a ton car, if not two tons to start it up; there was plenty of feedstock!"
13,2022-07-20,73," **Interviewer**: Okay, what else?"," **Interviewee**: To start up, we also used added water, and we continued to add water daily."
13,2022-07-20,74, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: We have a dug well. We were also getting water from the tap.
13,2022-07-20,75, **Interviewer**: That is water from the water board?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. We use water from the well for other things and not for drinking. Apart from that, we also have a borehole."
13,2022-07-20,76, **Interviewer**: What about that tank?, **Interviewee**: That's a storage tanks?
13,2022-07-20,77," **Interviewer**: Where is the source? Do you pump water from the ground and store it there, or you simply store water for water board in the tanks?", **Interviewee**: It was Blantyre board water.
13,2022-07-20,78, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We were feeding it with 20 kg of food waste, especially potato peels. To this, we were adding four buckets (20 liters) of water. Then, we were putting the mixture in a drum to decompose, and then pour the feedstock into digester bag. We did wear gloves when preparing the feedstock."
13,2022-07-20,79, **Interviewer**: Why wearing gloves?," **Interviewee**: To protect ourselves from bacteria. And, we were wearing a mask to protect ourselves from bad smell."
13,2022-07-20,80, **Interviewer**: Who has responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: A certain man was helping us in feeding.
13,2022-07-20,81, **Interviewer**: So I can say three people were responsible for feeding it. Who is this other person?, **Interviewee**: His name is Stevie
13,2022-07-20,82," **Interviewer**: I mean, what is his role?", **Interviewee**: He works as a ground labor; he was only feeding it when my colleagues and I were busy.
13,2022-07-20,83, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: To maintain it, we only needed to harvest gas from the digester bag when it was filled to allow it to produce new gas. I think that was the only thing that was needed to keep it working. I'm saying this because I observed that the pipe was damaged because the bag was filled with gas and there was no exit for the gas."
13,2022-07-20,84, **Interviewer**: But you have harvesting bags or storage bags. Why didn\'t you harvest and store the gas?," **Interviewee**: Yes, we have storage bags. But this happened during a school holiday so no one was around to harvest the gas. So the gas needs to be harvested whenever it is full. I mean, when you feed it gas keeps on coming and it needs to be removed to avoid such occurrences."
13,2022-07-20,85," **Interviewer** Okay, does it produce digestate?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it released digestate at the outlet there"
13,2022-07-20,86, **Interviewer**: Where does the digestate go?, **Interviewee**: We use it there in vegetables and other places
13,2022-07-20,87, **Interviewer**: How does it go there? Do you carry it there or does it go there directly?, **Interviewee**: We carry the digestate in a drum to the vegetable garden.
13,2022-07-20,88, **Interviewer**: You have said you carry it to other places as well. Where else do you carry it?, **Interviewee**: We carry it to our homes and use it in our gardens. We also use it as fertilizer for flowers.
13,2022-07-20,89, **Interviewer**: Did you sell the gas?," **Interviewee**: Not when I was around. But, there was a certain time some people were looking for gas. But, I don't know if they came to get the gas."
13,2022-07-20,90, **Interviewer**: Where were you around that time?, **Interviewee**: I was on holiday.
13,2022-07-20,91," **Interviewer**: The time it was working, did it meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we were not struggling; we would simply cut vegetables, put a pot on the stove - it was very easy -- it was easy to cook."
13,2022-07-20,92," **Interviewer**: Were there times you wanted to cook, but you could not do so because there was little or no gas at all?"," **Interviewee**: It was happening when there was little or no gas in the bag. But, we were quick to note problem; we noted that when it was out of feedstock, we could not get enough gas."
13,2022-07-20,93," **Interviewer**: Okay, why were you not feeding it us required? Was it laziness or you were just thinking everything is OK"," **Interviewee**: Just taking things for granted. When we saw it working, we thought that it was going to keep on working at the same pace. Maybe, sometimes, it takes longer for the feedstock to decompose in the drum. So, we couldn't feed it when the feedstock hadn't start decomposed."
13,2022-07-20,94, **Interviewer**: Okay," **Interviewee**: But, it was nothing to do with the feedstock because it was always available."
13,2022-07-20,95," **Interviewer**: Oh, that reminds me, how often were you feeding it?"," **Interviewee**: Every day we were supposes to feeding it. And, we were feeding it every day."
13,2022-07-20,96, **Interviewer**: Everything in life has challenges. What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: Uumh, we had fears that this thing is expensive, so we tried hard to take good care of it and make it last long. At the same time, we were doing everything so that we should not return to use firewood."
13,2022-07-20,97," **Interviewer**: You haven't answered my question. Like I said everything else challenges, what challenges did you encounter or are you encountering with this thing? First, I would say..."," **Interviewee**: The main issue was blocking of the system due to water log. A limitation in its functionality is that, water accumulates in the pipes and blocks the flow of gas, as a result, little or no gas comes at the stove."
13,2022-07-20,98," **Interviewer**: You can go attend to the students... Yeah, you were talking about challenges. You mentioned the water issues in the pipes. How did this problem manifest?"," **Interviewee**: Whenever, there is no fire, we go check - so we knew."
13,2022-07-20,99, **Interviewer**: Where do you check?," **Interviewee**: First, we look at the white thing (water trap). Then, water clogs along the pipes and there is another place at/or close to the stove."
13,2022-07-20,100, **Interviewer**: How many water-clogging problems did you faced? And how many managed to fix?, **Interviewee**: Many times - and we were told to open the water trap regularly to get rid of water in the system.
13,2022-07-20,101, **Interviewer**: Like how many times?," **Interviewee**: Maybe, five times. But, then we started removing water from the water trap even before it is blocked."
13,2022-07-20,102," **Interviewer**: Okay, how long did it take before it stopped working?"," **Interviewee**: Mmh, it has worked before a long time, but I cannot say how long. I think it's been year and some months now."
13,2022-07-20,103, **Interviewer**: OK after a year or so that's when it stopped?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
13,2022-07-20,104, **Interviewer**: Did it stop at once or gradually?," **Interviewee**: It did not stop at once. It was gradually declining. Yeah, and it hasn't really stopped working like it can never be fixed. The problem is the gas pipe burst. It\'s only that. You would have seen the bag fully inflated, if the pipe didn't burst."
13,2022-07-20,105," **Interviewer**: After the pipe burst, what did you do? What have you done?", **Interviewee**: We told our Madam who called them. She told us to leave it as it is because someone will come to fix it.
13,2022-07-20,106, **Interviewer**: When was that?," **Interviewee**: Last week, the person coming to fix it was supposed to come last week."
13,2022-07-20,107, **Interviewer**: When did it stop working?, **Interviewee**: It\`s been a month or two.
13,2022-07-20,108, **Interviewer**: You said you were taught ...., **Interviewee**: Wait! Let me attend to the student.
13,2022-07-20,109," **Interviewer**: (after some time) oh, while you were away, my friend was asking about the ponds behind that block. I said they are fishponds...", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
13,2022-07-20,110, **Interviewer**: Do you have fish there?, **Interviewee**: There is chambo in there -- yeah!
13,2022-07-20,111, **Interviewer**: (Laughs heavily) oh?, **Interviewee**: We have chambo in there. We feed it ourselves and we have its feed. We fish chambo in there.
13,2022-07-20,112," **Interviewer**: Okay, we are on this piece of information. Have you seen something like this?", **Interviewee**: No!
13,2022-07-20,113," **Interviewer**: It has information regard issues associated with digester, and even the issue of water blocking the system you talked about is here. What do you think of this kind of information, and do you think it would have helped?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they talked about water clogging the system. This information could have helped a lot."
13,2022-07-20,114, **Interviewer**: Elaborate., **Interviewee**: We could have learned a lot about problem solving and it could have helped to us solve certain problems.
13,2022-07-20,115," **Interviewer**: What they told you, the training you received; wasn\`t enough?"," **Interviewee**: It was sufficient. But, I feel like I'm the problem that it\`s not working. I'm the one to blame for it stopping to work because I was the one tasked to harvest gas. Unfortunately, when I left for a four-day holiday, I didn't feed it. So gas production continued and had no outlet; and I even conceded that I didn't harvest the gas, when the installers asked me through my boss."
13,2022-07-20,116, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of your digest?, **Interviewee**: It's currently not working but I think it is fixable. \[Stops to pick a call\]
13,2022-07-20,117, **Interviewer**: How did it reach this state?, **Interviewee**: I failed to harvest gas from the digester bag that\`s the reason it's not working today.
13,2022-07-20,118," **Interviewer**: So you are certain that if you had harvested the gas, it could have been working today?", **Interviewee**: I\`m more than certain.
13,2022-07-20,119, **Interviewer**: Is there any other reason or cause it is in this current state?, **Interviewee**: It's only for that one reason -- and now we can\'t feed it because gas will be leaking through the hole. We will start feeding it again once it's fixed.
13,2022-07-20,120, **Interviewer**: When are they coming to fix it?, **Interviewee**: Any day - my boss asked me today if the technicians had come to fix it.
13,2022-07-20,121," **Interviewer**: Now that it is not working, what are you using for energy i.e. cooking?"," **Interviewee**: We are now back to ""Deforestation"" -- We are now using charcoal."
13,2022-07-20,122, **Interviewer**: (laughs) Okaaay, **Interviewee**: Charcoal burners are now our lifesavers -- Biogas stoves are history now.
13,2022-07-20,123, **Interviewer**: What challenges are you facing now since it\`s not working?," **Interviewee**: Uh, We are spending a lot of money (laughs)"
13,2022-07-20,124, **Interviewer**: Like how much?," **Interviewee**: In a week, we are now spending K3000 to K3500."
13,2022-07-20,125, **Interviewer**: What are you doing with the feedstock now?," **Interviewee**: We are just keeping the feedstock; potato peels are not difficult to keep. As for other food waste, we dispose of in a refuse pit."
13,2022-07-20,126, **Interviewer**: Where are the potatoes peels today? I can\`t see them., **Interviewee**: We didn't cook chips today.
13,2022-07-20,127, **Interviewer**: Where are yesterdays or the other days potato peels?," **Interviewee**: We just throw them in the bins, and we will use the later."
13,2022-07-20,128, **Interviewer**: How much did the reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I don't know. But, it was a lot of cash."
13,2022-07-20,129, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: The thing just looks expensive. And, I have not seen people using it, so it much be really expensive."
13,2022-07-20,130," **Interviewer**: But, the money came from school fund?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
13,2022-07-20,131," **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. We need to go, so you can attend to other duties as well. Did you or your organization contribute anything in kind?"," **Interviewee**: Aah, it's only the land -- and the big blue drums."
13,2022-07-20,132, **Interviewer**: Do you know how that much cost?," **Interviewee**: I don't know: maybe K2000 or 3000 each, and we have 3 of them."
13,2022-07-20,133, **Interviewer**: Who built it?, **Interviewee**: Only 2 people
13,2022-07-20,134, **Interviewer**: Did you do any brickwork?," **Interviewee**: I don't know. Maybe, they did. I can't no, because the time they were installing it I was busy with other things. But, I'm sure there s something underneath. They can\'t just say bury the bag without any protection."
13,2022-07-20,135, **Interviewer**: Which special items had to be imported from other countries?," **Interviewee**: The bag - that bag is not from Malawi. I have grown up here in Malawi and I have never heard or seen something like a biogas digester. I also receive visitors who come to see what it is; maybe it's somewhere else. But, as far as I'm concerned, this was my first time to see."
13,2022-07-20,136," **Interviewer**: Tell about me that, who comes?"," **Interviewee**: It\`s mostly people who have heard about cooking using gas. Most people ask me about biogas especially when I carry the storage bag filled with gas. Children get very surprised and alarmed when they see me carrying the storage bag on my back. They even run in fear. But, some grown up people, know that it gas, and they ask where I getting the gas. Then, I tell them we have a digester bag."
13,2022-07-20,137, **Interviewer**: What do people think or say about biogas?," **Interviewee**: People are interested to learn more on how it works. They even come after, and I take them to the kitchen to show them how it works."
13,2022-07-20,138, **Interviewer**: Do they seem impressed?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) I think so. But, money is a challenge. Times are hard!"
13,2022-07-20,139, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) what is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I personally think biogas is very important to us. It helps us a lot in terms of cooking and saving money. Also, it's helping us to conserve the environment."
13,2022-07-20,140, **Interviewer**: Uh-hmm," **Interviewee**: I would like to see it working again to make our cooking easy. We do not struggle to cook as we do at our homes when we have it running. It's fast just like cooking on an electric cooker -- You cannot compare into with charcoal or firewood in terms of quickness. When you put a pot of water on the stove, it doesn\'t take long to boil. It takes only 5 minutes."
13,2022-07-20,141, **Interviewer**: How long does it take the water to boil on charcoal or firewood? And how big are the pots?," Interviewee: It's a big pot that one can use the water adequately for bathing. It takes normally not less than 20 minutes to get the same water boiled on charcoal. Biogas is not like charcoal or firewood, which forces you to constantly blown air to increase the intensity of the fire. With the biogas you just turn the switch control nod left and right, just like you increase volume on a radio. So when we want to cook rice, we just minimize the volume on the stove. To get well-cooked rice you just minimize the gas on stove as I have said."
13,2022-07-20,142, **Interviewer**: You know this thing is good. How are you allowing it stay unfixed for a month or so? We can't say its money. One student's tuition can get this thing working., **Interviewee**: (laughs) we are simply waiting for the installers to come and restore it.
13,2022-07-20,143, **Interviewer**: Why do you think it's taking long?, **Interviewee**: I think it's taking long because of the technician. He is the one taking long. My boss called me to ask if he has come today.
13,2022-07-20,144," **Interviewer**: Last question, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?", **Interviewee**: I can't choose anything else besides biogas.
13,2022-07-20,145, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: I can't say solar panels because it has its own limitations.
13,2022-07-20,146, **Interviewer**: What limitations?," **Interviewee**: Sometimes, the panels get broken, after that is the end of it. As for this, it gets its power from cow dung."
13,2022-07-20,147," **Interviewer**: So you would have no chosen anything else but biogas, the bag can also get damaged."," **Interviewee**: Mmmh, honestly, I don't have options. This is a difficult question for me."
13,2022-07-20,148, **Interviewer**: Why is it Difficult?," **Interviewee**: I can't say charcoal burners. That's eeish. So, I can only opt to use food waste for compost making; it's simple you just put food was in a bag and allow it to decompose. Later, use it as manure."
13,2022-07-20,149, **Interviewer**: Why are you not doing that?, **Interviewee**: Because we are just waiting for the technician -- that's all. He will come.
13,2022-07-20,150, **Interviewer**: Why have made you think it the technician who is delaying this instead of anything else?," **Interviewee**: My boss asked me if the technician had come, and told her not yet. The owner is ready. The technician is the one who has problems."
13,2022-07-20,151," **Interviewer**: Okay, that's my last question. In closing, do you have anything else to say?", **Interviewee**: You asked me about which options I could have chosen instead of this. What options are available? I didn't have options.
13,2022-07-20,152," **Interviewer**: What you said was quite like. You can use the waste to make compost and fertilizer. That\'s a very good option. In terms of energy, you mentioned solar, that's another option. We have electricity cooking option, LP gas"," **Interviewee**: Oh, I forgot LPG gas. We have that. At some point, we used that. It has gas canister that needs refill of gas once it stops working."
13,2022-07-20,153, **Interviewer**: Why did you stop?, **Interviewee**: We just abandoned it.
13,2022-07-20,154,\[question inaudible\]," **Interviewee**: I don't know. But, we have many gas canisters."
13,2022-07-20,155, **Interviewer**: How many?, **Interviewee**: Many. Some even took them home.
13,2022-07-20,156, **Interviewer**: How different is LPG gas from biogas?," **Interviewee**: With LPG gas, you need to go search for the gas when it\'s finished. While biogas needs feeding with waste, which is usually readily available. So LPG is a bit complicated."
13,2022-07-20,157, **Interviewer**: Okay thanks. That end of our interviews.," **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming. I enjoyed the conversation and I have learned one or two things. Thanks, and make sure you call my boss to inform her you came."
13,2022-07-20,158," **Interviewer**: I will, and I called her when I was coming, before I called you.",NA
14,2022-07-20,1,Thanks for the interview. This will be a short interview as you discussed more about the digester with my colleagues. So where did this digester originate?,"This one was, eeh, was originally planted here some five, six years ago"
14,2022-07-20,2,"Okay, who made this design?","This digester right here was design by \[name redacted\], a Japanese man. But, Malawi Industrial Research did the whole technical part of it."
14,2022-07-20,3,"Oh, okay, okay.","Yeah... Yeah, they are the ones."
14,2022-07-20,4,Who funded this?,It\'s MEET \[Malawi Environmental Endowment Trust\] through COPRED.
14,2022-07-20,5,"So, who built it?","With the assistance from the community, we provided casual workers. And, for the building itself we provided a builder -- That is COPRED now."
14,2022-07-20,6,So your role was uh?,To see that this thing is here and that it is functioning.
14,2022-07-20,7,"So, how were you selected as a beneficiary?","We had a project here and we saw that people were suffering in terms of sourcing fertilizer; as a result, they were not harvesting enough. At the same time, we saw the community had many cattle, but it was not been used productively. So, we thought of a way of utilizing the manure to produce renewable energy; gas that people could use for cooking and lighting."
14,2022-07-20,8,Did you know about biogas before?,"Yes, we did."
14,2022-07-20,9,"So, how did you know about biogas?","We had a certain project in a certain area, and we visited people who were doing that; we appreciated a certain project in Chikwawa, an ECD projects which involved school going people, and at the centre they were using gas biogas to prepare porridge."
14,2022-07-20,10,ECD is Early Child Development?,"Yeah, yeah! That is early child development."
14,2022-07-20,11,"So, what were your expectations?","We expected that people in this area would start using gas for energy. Therefore, instead of using firewood for cooking, they would use gas \[biogas\] for cooking."
14,2022-07-20,12,"You said the designer was Japanese, so what did this Japanese person told you to expect? And, even Malawi Industrial Research, what did they tell you that you should expect from this?",He said this digester would produce a lot of gas of which the houses around would use for lighting as well as cooking in this communal kitchen.
14,2022-07-20,13,So this was a communal kitchen?,"Yeah, this is a communal kitchen."
14,2022-07-20,14,"So, how many people were expecting to benefit from this project?",We were expecting 25 families to use this system.
14,2022-07-20,15,Did the beneficiaries receive any training?,"No, we just built it, but it did not reach to a point where we could use it -- It failed after commissioning and did not proceed with the trainings. But, I think if it had worked after commissioning it and seeing that the thing was working well, then that is when we could have started training the beneficiaries."
14,2022-07-20,16,"From my understanding, you chose this one because there was a need, uh?","You sure there was a need. You can see the Soche Mountain there; people from this community were going to Soche Mountain to destroy the trees resulting into deforestation. So, we thought of giving people an alternative to prevent them from destroying trees in the mountain - so this was an alternative. We could not have said, do not go to the mountain if we did not give them anything. Therefore, we gave them this, as an alternative for them not to go to the mountain to cut trees for firewood; and the cutting down of trees in Soche Mountain was heavy; that is why you do not see trees there -- it was very bad."
14,2022-07-20,17,"So, how did people meet there energy needs before this intervention?","They were using firewood for cooking; people were just collecting wood from the Soche Mountain. So, our aim was to lessen that; we wanted them to start using biogas and quit using firewood."
14,2022-07-20,18,How did it work after commissioning? I understand it not work at all. Take me through that.,"It worked nicely on the testing day, but within a day, it stopped."
14,2022-07-20,19,Do you know how much gas did it produce on that day?,"With that, with that (stammers) ... I do not know the actual amount of gas it produced, but I know that we were able to cook for some time on that particular day."
14,2022-07-20,20,"So, could you please quantify it in terms of cooking hours or cooking time?","Some people cooked some beans. There were three families cooked beans on that day, and one family cooked nsima \[hard porridge\] on that day. Therefore, after some time the gas started coming declining, and it went off completely. In regards to lighting, they did not use it for lighting because we did not provide with lightning lamps."
14,2022-07-20,21,"So, all these people you are talking about, where they cooking simultaneously or one after another?",They were cooking one after another because it had one stove.
14,2022-07-20,22,"So roughly, how many hours did it take? 5 hours?","Yeah, it took 5 -- 6 hours."
14,2022-07-20,23,"Okay, okay. Nice. Nice. So for this to run, what were the operation requirements?","For this to run, it required manure and water."
14,2022-07-20,24,"Uumh, which type of manure? Human manure?","No, cattle dung because people here had many cattle, so we thought it could run easily. We felt that it could be easy for the people to bring manure and mix with water for this to run. So, these were the only things that were required."
14,2022-07-20,25,How were you planning to collect the dung from the community? What was the procedure or plan for gathering manure?,"There was a committee, so the members of the committee would have been collecting the manure from the people."
14,2022-07-20,26,How did you prepare the feedstock?,"We have a reservoir there where we gathered water because water is scarce here; people walk a long distance to get water. So, we provided that reservoir there so that people would draw water from the borehole and the river and put in that tank; and then the manure was put in manure in this tank, and then mix them together to ferment for period of 3 days. Thereafter, the mixture would go into the chamber for fermentation and gas production."
14,2022-07-20,27,"So, what was the ratio of cow manure and water?","At first, we started with five wheelbarrows of cow manure and 100 liters of water."
14,2022-07-20,28,"So, can you be clear on this, who was responsible for feeding it? The committee?","Yeah, the committee; there was a chair and secretary alike. We were just supervising."
14,2022-07-20,29,What were the maintenance requirements?,"We discussed with the community that people would need to pay to cooking various foods in the community kitchen. Therefore, the committee and people would have agreed a certain fixed fee for the service; and the money collected during that period was for repairs."
14,2022-07-20,30,"So clearly, this did not meet the needs of the community. What were the gaps?",A lot of them; the challenge of water was another one. People had to walk a long distance to get water. Another challenge was manure; it was difficult to source manure.
14,2022-07-20,31,How many kilometers was that?,"There are two sources; there is a borehole and the river. So, people were to walk one -- two kilometers to get water. Another challenge was dung. You know, sometimes animals get infections sometimes and they die. Therefore, manure was a challenge; to get manure was a challenge."
14,2022-07-20,32,"So, the main problem was when people were cooking, the gas started diminishing?","Yes. - The flames at first was coming out nicely and strongly, but when one woman started cooking been it took longer. Then after that, gas started coming little by little, and it ceased."
14,2022-07-20,33,How long did you use it again?,Only for a day.
14,2022-07-20,34,"Sad, sad! We are 70% of through our interview. So, after that, what did you do? Did you fix it? Or, what did you do?","No, we had no funds. The funds we got from MEET were exhausted. In addition, the community could not have afforded or managed to troubleshoot it. And, the one who designed this went home soon after finishing construction work."
14,2022-07-20,35,You mean the designer was not there when you were commissioning it?,"Yes, he was not there. He was not there. But, there were officers from Malawi Industrial research who tried to troubleshoot it to no avail. Then, as COPRED, we did not continue to fix because we had no funds."
14,2022-07-20,36,What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped?,"Yes, this information would have helped. Moreover, I think they should have given us a manual to see how to operate this... So, this could have been a guiding tool."
14,2022-07-20,37,"So, how would you describe the current state of this digester?","As you can see, right now, this can be maintained. As you are aware now, there are persistent power cuts; and people are crying over electricity; and I'm sure many people from this community can be helped in terms of electricity and cooking, if it can be maintained."
14,2022-07-20,38,Do you think this digester can be maintained?,"It only worked for a day so chances are high that a technician can fix or modify it, and make it."
14,2022-07-20,39,"So, in your opinion, what caused this to fail?","Maybe there is a leakage - I think so. Because, if it there was no leakage, gas would not have been diminishing. I believe there is a leak, and gas was escaping through that leak; otherwise, it would have been working up to this day."
14,2022-07-20,40,"So you have said that, because this did not we work, people are still using wood for cooking, uh?","Yes, now they are cutting down trees for firewood; but now since the trees are finished in Soche Mountain, I do not know exactly where they are getting the firewood, and how they are surviving. I think people are now using trees from their homes; some are using maize stalks from their field for cooking."
14,2022-07-20,41,"In regards to feedstock, you said when you were starting this project you saw that people had plenty of cow dung in this community. So, now since the project did not succeed, what are people doing with the cow dung?",They are just applying in their gardens.
14,2022-07-20,42,You think so?,Yeah - sure.
14,2022-07-20,43,"Yeah, we are 80% through with our interview. We are only remaining with five questions regarding finances. Okay. So how much did this reactor cost?","That one I have forgotten, unless I get back to my books, then I can give you the correct figures."
14,2022-07-20,44,"But, the funds came from ?",The funds came from Malawi environmental endowment Trust (MEET). It is MEET.
14,2022-07-20,45,"That is where \[name redacted\] works, right?","That is where she is, and she knows bout this."
14,2022-07-20,46,"Oooh \[Laughs\] So, how much labor went into this?","Here the main workforce was the builders only. The government research people from Industrial research only got allowances, fuel, and we paid them for transportation of these materials. We purchased some bricks and we paid the builders; the community provided collected sand, water and transported the bricks\... The community also dug the holes too."
14,2022-07-20,47,How many people where involved in digging?,"The community people came simultaneously as it involved the community and the chief arranged for that, so it is hard to know how many people worked on this. But, the chief might know."
14,2022-07-20,48,"So, I can imagine there were a number of people\... Who did the masonry work?","This was a design made by Shikawa, so the builders were just building according to the design."
14,2022-07-20,49,How many builders built it?,They were two of them.
14,2022-07-20,50,What kind of special item had to be imported from another country?,Nothing was imported. Everything was local.
14,2022-07-20,51,What is your opinion of biogas?,"Biogas is good as it is a natural gas and it\`s user friendly. With biogas, you do not damage anything -- you do not damage the environment. Biogas only recycles animal manure, which is very important; and with that, you get gas for cooking as well as fertilizer. Therefore, this \[Biogas\] is nice."
14,2022-07-20,52,"Yes, indeed, biogas is a good thing, but it is not progressing. Why do you think about its failing?","It is about awareness I can say so; because if people could have know this before, and practically see what it does, I think most people would go for this."
14,2022-07-20,53,"If you could have designed your waste intervention, what could you have chosen instead of this one?","They are two; I would have chosen biogas because you get two products from it; you get gas for cooking and fertilizer, so it is more like killing two birds with one stone. In regards to waste intervention, if we had waste collection points in different area, it would have helped us; because people would have been collecting manure, while also we creating a clean environment and make places health. Thus, the waste from these collection points would need to be transferred to a one dumping site for decomposition, and then people could have been getting decomposed waste and apply it as manure, rather than dumping waste anyhow."
14,2022-07-20,54,"Thank you. In closing, do you have anything to say?",I believe and trust that you are going to come again. This is not the end of the journey. I believe and trust that you are going to come back and see how best you can help the community to maintain this biogas plant.
14,2022-07-20,55,"Okay, thank you.",NA
15,2022-07-21,1," **Interviewer**: First question, where did this digester come from?"," **Interviewee**: We got this from a company called Ecogen. They initially distributed flyers of their products and then they came to market their products here. Therefore, after they marketed their product we were interested and thought about trying a digester.... So, yeah, we got it from Ecogen."
15,2022-07-21,2," **Interviewer**: So, they marketed it and that is when you got interested?", **Interviewee**: Right!
15,2022-07-21,3, **Interviewer**: How did they market the digesters? Was it in the newspaper or something?," **Interviewee**: No, it was not in the newspaper. They came at our cow owners group, and discussed about biogas. They mentioned that it is a technology that produces gas for cooking as well as fertilizer, and that's the reason that got us interested \[visitor interrupts\]"
15,2022-07-21,4," **Interviewer**: You can go attend to the visitor... So, it came from Ecogen. Do you know who designed it?"," **Interviewee**: It is Ecogen. They brought everything. They only asked to choose the size of the digester that we wanted... They have all sorts of sizes -- and that time they had digesters smaller than this one. So, after we chose the digester they advised us to dig two holes, and then they promised us to come later to install it."
15,2022-07-21,5," **Interviewer**: How many people were involved in digging? And, how long did it take?"," **Interviewee**: It took a considerable amount of time to dig the holes because it was summer and the ground was dry that time. Four people dug the holes and it took them about one week, because as I said the ground was dry and rocky too. In addition, the installer came with people, who helped us to dig the holes; and that is the reason we finished the work faster than expected."
15,2022-07-21,6, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation came?," **Interviewee**: They came four people, but only three people were involved in the work: two boys and one girl."
15,2022-07-21,7," **Interviewer**: You are saying the installers had different sizes of digesters; and they even had smaller ones, so why did you choose this size?"," **Interviewee**: We considered the quantity of cow manure we generate, because owning a digester depends on how much cow manure you can generate, so since we have a lot of cows we settled for a bigger digester. Moreover, we wanted to get more fertilizer and gas without wasting any cow manure, so we settled for a bigger digester."
15,2022-07-21,8, **Interviewer**: How many cows do you have?, **Interviewee**: We have six cows.
15,2022-07-21,9, **Interviewer**: I understand you learn a lot about biogas when Ecogen came to your milk group...," **Interviewee**: Yeah, SHMPA \[Shire Highlands Milk Producers Association\]"
15,2022-07-21,10," **Interviewer**: Before that, did you know anything about biogas?"," **Interviewee**: I was only hearing about biogas on radio, and I saw it on their \[Ecogen\] flyer. But, then we were not paying much attention to all that. We became interested and attentive to the radio messages after Ecogen came. So, we learned that manure could produce gas for cooking and fertilizer from Ecogen at SHMPA."
15,2022-07-21,11," **Interviewer**: So, how many people were you there?"," **Interviewee**: There were many women, I understand. Maybe, 500 people in total, but I was not there."
15,2022-07-21,12, **Interviewer**: How many people got the digesters out of the 500 people?," **Interviewee**: I only know, four people, if not three, from this side \[Mpemba\]. And, it is not as if the others did not like biogas, no. But, there were three or four reasons that made them not to buy the digesters. First, some people did not believe that cow dung could produce gas and fertilizer via the digester. Therefore, they were skeptical as such, they preferred to observe and learn from their colleagues. Also, when Ecogen mentioned the price of the digesters people found them expensive, and people even thought they could not afford the cheaper small bag digesters. But, I believe the people found the price high because they did not consider their monthly expenditure on cooking -- they could not see that -- they only saw the figure of K600000, and thought it was high. So, the fact that people were not sure about the gas and fertilizer and its price that is why most people did not buy the digesters. But, now many people want this thing in their homes, because they have seen how useful this thing is. And, many people we have seen and heard, that would like to own biogas ask us if it's possible to pay in installments--so that's the number one questionwe receive from people who come from various place to appreciate it. People who come here to appreciate it even think that with the amount of cow manure they generate, they could be making a lot of money from the digester by selling the manure."
15,2022-07-21,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: Our expectation was that our lives would change. I mean, we anticipated that we would stop spending money on some of the things which were buying, for example, firewood and charcoal, and that is K30000 per month. For instance, we use at least three bags of charcoal a month, so you can see that is a lot of money. We expected to save the money, which were spending on fertilizer, and when we considered how high the price of fertilizer has escalated, we thought that we would be saving a lot of money. Also, we expected to stop using pesticides by using the effluent. Again, we expected it to improve milk production -- for example, if we were producing 4 liters of milk we expected to produce 8 or 10 liters. Thus, we expected to attain this by mixing effluent with cow feedstock e.g. maize bran or grass and then feed it to the cows, as this greatly improves milk quality and quantity... In regards to using is it as a pesticide, we dilute the effluent with water, and then we apply the diluted effluent on maize to get rid of weevils and other pests."
15,2022-07-21,14, **Interviewer**: How do you apply it?," **Interviewee**: We normally take effluent and dilute it with water in a bottle or bucket. Then, we drop the liquid at the top of the maze crop, and all the pest goes away. Therefore, effluent is a pesticide as well as an additive for cow feed."
15,2022-07-21,15, **Interviewer**: How do you make the pesticide?," **Interviewee**: We dilute the effluent every time we want to use it, because it is very strong when undiluted. Therefore, we dilute the effluent in a ratio of 1:2. Thus, if we have 20 liters of effluent we dilute it with 40 liters of water."
15,2022-07-21,16, **Interviewer**: What do you feed your cow?, **Interviewee**: We feed it with maize bran and grass.
15,2022-07-21,17, **Interviewer**: How do you specifically make the feed with effluent to improve milk quality and quantity?," **Interviewee**: We add the effluent to the feed. We do not soak or immerse the feed in the effluent. We simply splash or spray the effluent on the feed, so that it does not get watery. We simply splash and the mix feed, and feed it to the cows."
15,2022-07-21,18, **Interviewer**: I talked to someone who is using effluent as a bio-pesticide. He told me that he adds ginger and paper to make a strong pesticide. Do you do that?, **Interviewee**: No.
15,2022-07-21,19, **Interviewer**: Okay! Why not? Have you not heard about it?, **Interviewee**: About putting ginger into the effluent?
15,2022-07-21,20," **Interviewer**: Yeah, about diluting the effluent with water in a ratio of 1:2 as you mentioned, then add ginger or pepper, and then putit in a sprayer, andafterwards sprayit on the maize, vegetables, whatever."," **Interviewee**: No, we have never done that. But, when we dilute the effluent with water, and then apply it as a pesticide it works perfectly -- and it is a strong pesticide."
15,2022-07-21,21," **Interviewer**: Okay, what kind of training did you receive from the installers?"," **Interviewee**: When they came to install it, they trained us. On that day, they showed us how to make feedstock and make the feedstock ourselves. It was basic; they simply asked us to put manure in a bucket, and then add water according to a certain ratio. Afterwards, they told us to wait for five days to allow the feedstock to decompose and produce gas. And, on the fifth day, they came and found the bag full. They told us how to start the fire and how to regulate it. Then, they told us to do this and that when it stops to fix it and that whenever there is a big problem we should be calling them."
15,2022-07-21,22, **Interviewer**: Which issues were you taught how to fix?," **Interviewee**: There are certain times when the digester stays long unused. Since the production of gas continues, it accumulates in the system, and then it turns to water. So, when one wants to use it again, the gas does not come at all or it comes in small quantity, because water blocks the flow of gas. Therefore, they told us that if this happens we should be opening a certain place to remove water in the system. Also, they told us that when it is blocked, water in the cylinder or tube rises up to full, so when we see that, we should know it is blocked. They also told us to unblock it we only need to lift the pipe to make water to flow back into reactor -- and, when we do that, it comes back to life again. On top of this, they informed us that this same thing happens at or close to the stove. They said when we see water or moist at the banner, we should take it out, throw the water away, and then replace the burner on the stove. Lastly, they said in the pipes there is something like a cleaning mesh wire pot scourer \[filter\] which helps to contain foul smell like that of rotten eggs. So, they advised us that when we smell odor like rotten egg odor at the stove, we should know that the filter is broken, and we should quickly replace it."
15,2022-07-21,23, **Interviewer**: Where did they tell you to get this wire?, **Interviewee**: They said we could buy it on our own.
15,2022-07-21,24, **Interviewer**: Is it readily available?, **Interviewee**: Yeah - in the markets.
15,2022-07-21,25," **Interviewer**: If you go to a market, what would you say you want to buy?", **Interviewee**: I will say I want a mesh wire scourer \[used for cleaning pots\].
15,2022-07-21,26," **Interviewer**: Oh, so the filter is pretty much a cleaning mesh wire scourer."," **Interviewee**. Yeah, it is similar. It is basically the same."
15,2022-07-21,27, **Interviewer**: What else were you trained? How was the training? Was it just theory or practical?," **Interviewee**: It was not as if they were fixing it, and they have never come to fix it. They were just explaining like this is what happens, and this is what you do. So, they shared this information during the 5 days when we were waiting for it to start, because they were coming often around that period."
15,2022-07-21,28, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about the training?," **Interviewee**: We were satisfied with the training, and we felt that we could run the digester."
15,2022-07-21,29, **Interviewer**: You did not feel that you would have issues operating it?," **Interviewee**: Yeah and when you look at the equipment you just have to be convinced; if you take a look the plastic basin at the outlet, you will be convinced - it's not like the plastic basins you know, this on is of high quality. You cannot just find it in in any shop. Even when you look at the digester bag, it is not like any other plastic bag, it is a durable plastic bag. Also, they assured us that if any problem arises, we should call them; so we were very confident to run or operate it... And even the pipes, they are not like the pipes you know, and that you cannot buy in Ndirande \[in local market\]"
15,2022-07-21,30, **Interviewer**: What reasons made you buy the digester?," **Interviewee**: We chose to buy a digester because we wanted to save money as much as possible. As you know Malawi is in a financial crisis, and it is very hard to make ends meet. So, at that time, when we thought about the price of fertilizer that was at K35000 to K40000, we saw that we could not manage. We did not only focus on fertilizer, we also looked at everything, for example, food prices, firewood. Then, we thought we could not manage without the digester; we even thought we could not afford to buy fertilizer for our tomato and vegetable garden. Also, when we thought of maize, it was clear that we could not afford fertilizer and pesticides. For example, last year we had many pests, which caused serious damage, but we failed to buy pesticide. So, that is when we thought of Ecogen and of buying a digester."
15,2022-07-21,31, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: We used firewood and charcoal.
15,2022-07-21,32, **Interviewer**: Which was your main source of energy between the two?, **Interviewee**: Charcoal.
15,2022-07-21,33, **Interviewer**: Do you buy?, **Interviewee**: We buy firewood and charcoal.
15,2022-07-21,34, **Interviewer**: How much were you spending on energy before the digester?, **Interviewee**: K40000 -- and that money was enough to use for cooking food and boiling water for bathing.
15,2022-07-21,35, **Interviewer**: How much are you spending on charcoal and firewood now?," **Interviewee**: Now, we do not keep records of how much we are spending on cooking."
15,2022-07-21,36, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: We are not spending a lot... Maybe, we are spending K12000 on a bag of charcoal."
15,2022-07-21,37," **Interviewer**: Before the digester, what were you using as pesticide?"," **Interviewee**: At first, when pest manifested our coups, we bought detergent soap, then soak it in water, and then apply it on our crops. Some other time we were buying small fishing, boil it, and then use the soup as a pesticide. So, instead of the pests eating the crop they were consuming the soup. So we were doing that - and even then, it was not effective, as we could not save all the crops; I can say we were only able to save a quarter of the produce."
15,2022-07-21,38, **Interviewer**: How did you learn those methods?, **Interviewee**: It is what people say and do if they do not use inorganic compounds as pesticides.
15,2022-07-21,39, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: At first, we were gathering the manure to use later as fertilizer. Sometimes, farmers were coming to ask for the manure, and sometimes we could just leave it anyhow."
15,2022-07-21,40," **Interviewer**: In regards to fertilizer, how were you doing it?"," **Interviewee**: We were buying expensive organic fertilizer sometimes; in a growing season, we were buying five, six or seven bags of in organic fertilizer, and even then, we couldn't manage to apply fertilizer to all our crops. So, to cope we were applying inorganic fertilizer added with manure on maize, and on the other side we used to grow crops that do not need fertilizer, for example, bean and soya beans."
15,2022-07-21,41, **Interviewer**: How big is your field?," **Interviewee**: It is very big, close to one \`hectare\` \[a very big land\]."
15,2022-07-21,42, **Interviewer**: Were you selling the manure to the people who used to ask for it?," **Interviewee**: No, we were not, even if we wanted to, no one would buy a bag of 50 kg of cow manure at K1000. People would ask you for K200 a bag and that is nothing if you consider the effort of finding grass and it is not worth selling. So, cow manure before the digester was useless."
15,2022-07-21,43, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: It worked perfectly. And, I can say now its performance is better than it was installed; now, it is better because of the sun, and because we feed it daily -- so it is good."
15,2022-07-21,44," **Interviewer**: How much cooking time did you get after commissioning? Were you able to cook breakfast, lunch and supper?", **Interviewee**: We were able to cook lunch and the boil water afterward (1 hour and 30 minutes)
15,2022-07-21,45, **Interviewer**: What about breakfast?, **Interviewee**: We were also able to prepare breakfast on it (10 --20 minutes)
15,2022-07-21,46, **Interviewer**: How do you use the gas? Is it just for cooking?," **Interviewee**: For the time being, the installers have told us that we can only use it for cooking. But, in the future, they will come and assist us to use it for lighting as well. And, that time if we had tap water, then they would have installed a geyser because they came with one that."
15,2022-07-21,47, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: You just need cow manure, water and sunlight."
15,2022-07-21,48, **Interviewer**: Where is your source of water?, **Interviewee**: We get water from a borehole.
15,2022-07-21,49, **Interviewer**: How far is it from here?," **Interviewee**: Not far, it is somewhere that side."
15,2022-07-21,50,\[question inaudible\]," **Interviewee**: Not too, close as well. That is like half a kilometer."
15,2022-07-21,51, **Interviewer**: How many people do use the gas now?, **Interviewee**: Six people.
15,2022-07-21,52," **Interviewer**: Okay, who is responsible for feeding it?"," **Interviewee**: Everyone feeds it -- everyone has a duty to feed it. But, mostly the person who looks after the cows feeds it. However, when he is busy I myself I feed it; I feel like it is my responsibility as well - and I know how to make feedstock also."
15,2022-07-21,53, **Interviewer**: Don't you feel that it is a daunting task?," **Interviewee**: It does not feel that way because that is our source of energy for cooking, and that is our fertilizer too. And, we feel that the more we feed it, the more effluent and fertilizer we get from it, which we will apply on our crops and even sell as well."
15,2022-07-21,54," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: The source of manure needs cleanliness and well taken care of to maintain it; and it is very necessary to ensure that cow manure does not contain rubbish. Also, the inlet must be covered after feeding to prevent people especially children from dropping unnecessary things in the bag. Further, its feedstock needs to be free from any impurities; if it is cow manure, it has to be cow manure -- and things like diaper should not be part of the feedstock. Plastic and other things should also not be part of the feedstock, because such things block digesters. Also, it is necessary to ensure that the surrounding is clean and the free from sharp objects that can pierce the digester bag. And, we need not to allow children or any other people to play around and on the digester bag; also, no one should be play with the fittings and pipes."
15,2022-07-21,55, **Interviewer**: Why? Is the gas dangerous?," **Interviewee**: No, the gas is safe and cannot cause any accident. So that is only a means of keeping people away from playing with the pipes, or from using sharp objects to cut the pipes, and also to prevent people from twisting the pipe thereby blocking the gas."
15,2022-07-21,56, **Interviewer**: Who is responsible for its maintenance? Do you share the responsibility with Ecogen?," **Interviewee**: Yes, if it stops working it is the responsibility of Ecogen to fix it. We cannot call anyone else to fix it, even a respectable technician. Besides, we do not know anyone who can fix it."
15,2022-07-21,57, **Interviewer**: Has it ever malfunctioned and called them?," **Interviewee**: Aaaah, no!"
15,2022-07-21,58, **Interviewer**: Ummh., **Interviewee**: We have never encountered any problem with it since it was installed.
15,2022-07-21,59, **Interviewer**: Not even a single problem?," **Interviewee**: One problem is that some people do not know how to operate. So, some people end up complaining that it is not working while it is working quite okay. The digester has a certain part \[gas valve\] that needs to be turned on to have gas at the stove, but some people do not open the gas at the gate valve, so it doesn't work -- so, it's just minor confusion. The other challenge comes also when people neglect to feed it."
15,2022-07-21,60," **Interviewer**: You have told me that you feel that it is your firewood, your fertilizer, so why would you neglect to feed it?"," **Interviewee**: You know people, people will always be people -- sometimes laziness creeps in."
15,2022-07-21,61," **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. Let us talk about gaps, are you solely using biogas now? Does it meet your needs?", **Interviewee**: Yes
15,2022-07-21,62, **Interviewer**: You mean you do not use charcoal and firewood anymore?," **Interviewee**: We only use firewood when we choose to use it. But, we are able to cook using biogas throughout the day."
15,2022-07-21,63," **Interviewer**: What times do you chooseto use firewood? And, why?"," **Interviewee**: We do not have specific times. It only depends on the preference of a particular person. In this house, we stay six people and it is not everyone who knows how to use it. So people who don't know how to use it prefer to use firewood. So, some people use firewood because someone who knows how to operate it is not around -- yeah!"
15,2022-07-21,64, **Interviewer**: You mean some people don't know how to use a biogas stove? How?," **Interviewee**: We have people of different age groups, so some are old and they find it difficult to use it. We also have a child who cannot manage to reach and open the gate valve that is located close to the stove."
15,2022-07-21,65," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay. Has there been any time or day where it has not worked?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, no!"
15,2022-07-21,66, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this?, **Interviewee**: No.
15,2022-07-21,67," **Interviewer**: What do you think about this kind of information, and do you think it would have helped you?"," **Interviewee**: I cannot speak for anyone else, but as far as I am concerned, I am okay with the information the installers gave me. I feel like I understand it, I know it, and we know what we are doing. For example, we know that when we feed it and open the gas valves and then switch on the stove, it produce flame and we cook."
15,2022-07-21,68," **Interviewer**: Okay, if this thing could fail today, what would you use for energy?", **Interviewee**: We will return to firewood and charcoal - things will be like theywere in the past.
15,2022-07-21,69," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay, we are remaining with five questions. How much did this digester cost?"," **Interviewee**: I do not know exactly how much we have spent on it. Maybe, we have spent K1.3 million; K1.2 million for the digester and K100000 for other work. For example, the money we paid to the people who collected water during installation phase."
15,2022-07-21,70," **Interviewer**: Did you pay K1.2 million on the spot, at one go?"," **Interviewee**: No, maybe we spent only the K100000 for digging the hole, drawing water and other things. In addition, as for the K1.2 million, we have not settled it yet."
15,2022-07-21,71, **Interviewer**: What is your installment plan? Are you going to pay the money in 6 months or 5 years?, **Interviewee**: It is a 4-year installment.
15,2022-07-21,72, **Interviewer**: How many people were involved in digging and how much did you pay them?," **Interviewee**: They were six people, and we paid them K8000."
15,2022-07-21,73," **Interviewer**: Apart from this work, what other work was involved?", **Interviewee**: Drawing water.
15,2022-07-21,74," **Interviewer**: How many people did you hire? And, how much did you pay them?", **Interviewee**: We hired four women and each one was paid K5000.
15,2022-07-21,75," **Interviewer**: You have said when you look at some of the material you know that you cannot find it in Ndirande, do you think it was imported from another country?"," **Interviewee**: It seems as everything was imported, starting from the digester bag, the plastic basins, the pipes, and even the stove it's not something you can find in Limbe -- the thing looks durable and it's very heavy -- it's something that cannot break after failing down -- it's not the stove you see in town -- it's a thing of good quality material."
15,2022-07-21,76," **Interviewer**: So, but just looking at it you know that it's not from Malawi?", **Interviewee**: Sure.
15,2022-07-21,77, **Interviewer**: We are remaining with three questions. You have said it is helping you in saving money; roughly how much money is it saving you in a month?, **Interviewee**: I can say we are saving more than K60000.
15,2022-07-21,78, **Interviewer**: A month?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and this time we are only saving money for cooking, and during the farming season we are expecting to save more because we are not going to buy fertilizer and even pesticides. We are also saving money on livestock farming - now we do not need boosters to have health cows to produce large quantity of milk and of high quality too -- so you can see that we are saving a lot of money."
15,2022-07-21,79, **Interviewer**: What is the biggest change in your life now that you have biogas?," **Interviewee**: Cooking is simple now. In the past we used to think about igniting and kindling fire, now we do not. And now when we are late for lunch, for example, when it's 11:45 AM, we know for sure that we will eat around 12:10 PM -- And that's not far from eating time (12:00)...... and most people this year are concerned about the price of fertilizer. They do not think they will be in a position to buy fertilizer, but if you ask us, we are not bothered about that."
15,2022-07-21,80, **Interviewer**: We have two questions remaining. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is a very good cooking method. The only problem is that it does not work well when there is no sun -- it does not produce enough gas when there is no sun. Talking of benefits, I can say it has many benefits some of which we never thought of --now the money we were spending on firewood and charcoal we are using to buy cooking oil and other things."
15,2022-07-21,81," **Interviewer**: Last one, if you could have designed your own energy or waste intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I do not think there is nothing else I would choose to replace biogas. In the past, we tried to use cow manure as fertilizer, but it did not fully work out. As a result, we were still adding inorganic fertilizer to make it effective.... You can think of LPG gas, but it is not as good as biogas because with LPG gas you need K30000 a month. Yet, with biogas, you do not need that amount of money. You only need waste, sunlight and water, which are free."
15,2022-07-21,82," **Interviewer**: That was my last question. In closing, do you have anything to say?", **Interviewee**: I have talked enough so I am good.
15,2022-07-21,83, **Interviewer**: Thanks for the interview.,NA
16,2022-07-21,1, **Interviewer**: Are we in Green Corner or Mpemba?,We are in Mpemba
16,2022-07-21,2, **Interviewer**: Where is Green Corner?,It's before Mpemba when coming here.
16,2022-07-21,3," **Interviewer**: Okay, first question, where did this digester originate from?",It came from Lilongwe. The owners' are these \[Stand and take a calendar of Ecogen\]
16,2022-07-21,4," **Interviewer**: Oh, okay. It came from Ecogen, and they even gave you a calendar, wow, nice (Laughs).",Yeah (Laughs)
16,2022-07-21,5," **Interviewer**: So, how did it get here? Did you buy this with your money?","Yes, and it did cost me K600000, and I'm supposed to pay in that in 2 years."
16,2022-07-21,6," **Interviewer**: K600000 in 2 years - Okay, how much are you paying a month? Or, they just said in two years, you should settle the debt?","They said I can be paying according to my financial standing, but up to this point, I haven\'t paid enough. I have challenges paying them because my cows were dry. Recently, they called me to check in on me, and I told them my cows were dry. Luckily, my cow has given birth to a calf, and I will be in a position to continue paying them. As of now, I have only paid K20000."
16,2022-07-21,7, **Interviewer**: I still a long way to go\...,"Yes, none of my cows had calves; only one cow was pregnant though and has a calf now. So, during that time, I couldn\'t milk. Now, since one has given birth, I will be able to milk and pay the debt."
16,2022-07-21,8," **Interviewer**: So now, you will be able to pay your debt?","Yes, yes, and I have to say the digester is helping me a lot, because I'm now able to cook food fast. So, I just have to pay them to show my appreciation."
16,2022-07-21,9,When did you buy this?,Last year.
16,2022-07-21,10,"Okay, okay, who built this?",It's the same people \[Ecogen\]
16,2022-07-21,11,How many people built this?,"They were two, right? \[Asks a son\]... There were two boys and one girl, and it took them about three days to complete. Initially, we were told to dig a hole for the digester but when they saw that the work was not done properly, they dug it themselves. Then after digging, they laid a thing like a blanket under the digester bag. The following day, they dug another hole and assembled the whole thing. In total, it took them 3 days, and they were doing the same work for three other cow farmers in this area."
16,2022-07-21,12,"You said before they came to dig the holes, they asked you to dig a hole or holes to place with the digester bag, and whatnot. How many people did you involve in this process?","The first two holes took two days, and they worked for another extra day to adjust the holes. So in total, it took three days to dig the holes. They gave me the dimensions for the hole to dig \[Goes to take a notebook\]. They give me this."
16,2022-07-21,13,"Okay, so the dimensions are 2.25 by 2.25 m with a depth of 0.9 m... Okay, thanks, I\'m seeing calculations written on the notebook as well. Was this for the digester, something else?","No (laughs). I write all kinds of things in this notebook; things concerning my group and other things, so when you too are leaving you need to sign in this book."
16,2022-07-21,14,"Okay, that's okay. You bought the digester, and you dug the hole. What other role did you play in this?",I was also responsible for water collection.
16,2022-07-21,15,How much water?,"I think it was three drums (200 liters) of water. At first, we used water from the tap, but then decided to use water from the borehole; a lot of water was used. Even now, this thing requires more water for mixing the feedstock."
16,2022-07-21,16, **Interviewer**: What type of drums?,The metal drums.
16,2022-07-21,17, **Interviewer**: I think those drums are 200 liters in capacity.,"Yeah, yeah, it was a lot. At first, we use water from water board, but then we decided to use water from borehole to save water and money."
16,2022-07-21,18," **Interviewer**: How did you connect with them \[Ecogen\], what happened?","We have an extension worker at SHMPA \[Shire Highlands Milk Producers Association\], who connected us with Ecogen. SHMPA is a milk producers group, and I\'m the chair,"
16,2022-07-21,19, **Interviewer**: Is SHMPA an acronym?,"Yes, it\'s a women group involved in cattle management, and it also gives women cattle. So, what happened was, Ecogen got in touch with the extension worker for this area, who came to SHMPA and encouraged us to adopt biogas. He also encouraged them to come here, because people have a lot of cattle here. Then, I had discussions with the extension worker, who asked me to persuade people to come and learn about biogas. He said he was advocating for biogas because people here have firewood and charcoal issues, and with biogas, people would be able to cook using cow manure. Then after some time, Ecogen came to SHMPA and they taught people about biogas. First, they started asking people how much charcoal and firewood each one was using per day or per month, how much firewood and charcoal cost, and they were recording this information on a paper. At the end, they gave a rough figure that the people spend per month and then a year; it was clear that people were not aware how much money they were spending on charcoal or firewood, and they found out that it was a lot that day. Then, they started a cooking demonstration, and said that at the end people would eat nsima cooked on biogas.We had doubts about it. Still two girls, one cooking nsima, and the other cooking side dish continued cooking, and to our amazement, we saw everything cooked, and we ate the nsima (Laughs)."
16,2022-07-21,20, **Interviewer**: Oh nice (Laughs),"Then we were asked, if we were interested, and as a chair of the group, I decided to lead by example and opted to get one. Then two other people, \[name redacted\] and \[name redacted\], both members of SHMPA, followed suit. And, it took the installers a week to install the digesters for the three us here in Mpemba."
16,2022-07-21,21, **Interviewer** Who is this other person? I only know \[name redacted\]....,"It's \[name redacted\]. She stays in Chadzunda, along \[location redacted\]."
16,2022-07-21,22, **Interviewer**: Is it not far from here?,It\'s far - It\'s far.
16,2022-07-21,23, **Interviewer**: You need to give me her number so I can get in touch with her.,\[Calls her son to get the phone to search the contact number from the phone\]
16,2022-07-21,24," **Interviewer**: Okay, I will get it at the end. So, on the day they came, were you able to eat nsima....","Yes, and it was fast."
16,2022-07-21,25, **Interviewer**: Like how fast?,"I didn\'t record the time, but it was fast. After eating, we boiled water and everything went well, the water boiled. Then, they said when it\'s not fast enough, we can put a sand of bag or a heavy stone on top of the digester bag to increase the intensity of the fire.They said if it's on a cold day, as it is now, we should be putting a sandbag on top of the digester bag too."
16,2022-07-21,26, **Interviewer** Why did they say you should be putting a heavy stone or a sandbag on top of the bag when it\'s cold?,To make more gas to travel into the pipes and the stove from the digester bags.
16,2022-07-21,27, **Interviewer**: Okay....,"And even now, when we do have issues with gas, we put sand of bag on top of the bag, and the fire becomes intense, that it then takes a very short time to cook things on the gas."
16,2022-07-21,28, **Interviewer**: I\'m seeing SHMPA - Ecogen meeting session and asking people to buy their product.....,"\[interrupts\] Yeah, they were asking people to buy and tell other people the goodness of biogas."
16,2022-07-21,29, **Interviewer**: How many people attended the training?,"Eh, we were many."
16,2022-07-21,30," **Interviewer**: Roughly, how many people?",Maybe around 150 people - were many.
16,2022-07-21,31," **Interviewer**: And sadly, only a few accepted the offer to buy....","Yes, some thought it was involving because it\'s more like cooking on firewood in the sense that it requires you to source manure and then constantly feed it with manure; and when it is not fed, it does not produce fire."
16,2022-07-21,32," **Interviewer**: You said the meeting session with Ecogen had 150 people and only three people bought the digester, only 3\....","Yes, three people bought the digester. We were then told about bio-fertilizer (Stops to pick a call).... so I get biofertiliser at the outlet. Last time, I grew maize using bio-fertilizer, without adding organic fertilizer, and I was able to harvest three bags of 50 kg of maize. I only used 4 buckets of bio-fertilizer, which I diluted with water to reduce its strength. We were told to add water to the bio-fertilizer because it's too strong and can damage maize if not diluted."
16,2022-07-21,33," **Interviewer**: How do you make the fertilizer? I mean, how much water do you add to the bio-fertilizer?","I add two buckets of water to one bucket of fertilizer, and we used a cup to apply the bio-fertilizer on the maize. We apply the bio-fertilizer two times, one for growth of the maize, and the other for strong kernels."
16,2022-07-21,34," **Interviewer**: Oh, that\'s good. Let me put it to you; you were about 150 people and only 3 people decided to buy with the digester. Why do you think only a small number of people bought it?","Because it was a new thing, and people did not believe that this thing works. But since that time, I have been receiving people frequently to appreciate the digester. You know people; people are always resistant to change and to new things. Also, some people thought they couldn't manage it because of their houses."
16,2022-07-21,35, **Interviewer**: Can you elaborate? Why did they say they couldn't manage it because of their houses?,"Maybe because they have small houses, and don\'t have a structure or don't have space to put the stove. But, I always tell them that they can make a structure of few bricks and plaster it in the kitchen to put the stove on, as in my kitchen. But, people are skeptical about it. Overall, I can say people showed interest, especially after they calculated the money people spend on firewood or charcoal in a year, and I'm sure people did not know that they spend that huge amount of money on firewood and charcoal."
16,2022-07-21,36," **Interviewer**: Based on the calculations, how much money do people spend on charcoal and firewood?",People were spending K1.5 million to K2.5 million per year.
16,2022-07-21,37, **Interviewer**: A single person?,"Yeah, you may ask you how; initially they started by simply asking how much firewood or charcoal we were using; how much does firewood or charcoal cost. We did not even think or know what they were trying to find out. And, when they mentioned how much people were spending, it showed that people were really spending a lot unknowingly, and we were all alarmed... They were like how many packs of charcoal do you use; how much does a pack of charcoal cost? K300! How many times do you cook? Three times! How much time do you spend on cooking nsima, beans so on and so forth? As for me, I sell thobwa (sweet beer), and they asked me questions regarding my business, for example, how much wood do you use a day? K1000 per day and -- K1000 per week! So, they calculated that from the first day of the month to the end of the month, and then to 12 months. After that, they started talking about fertilizer, how much a bag of fertilizer cost? K25000."
16,2022-07-21,38, **Interviewer**: And that was before the price of fertilizer got up...,"Yeah, and they made a total for all that. And, at the end, I was enlightened, eh, and I realized that I spend a lot of money. Talking of fertilizer, we have an extension worker who advises us to use manure or maize bran. But, we don\'t really buy into that, because when we use such manure we still add inorganic fertilizer. However, during the last grow season Ecogen told us to use the bio-fertilizer only, without adding inorganic fertilizer to appreciate its strength and impact on our maize crop. Then, they came with journalists to document the occasion. They filmed us eating maize and all that.On top of that an organization called One Acre visited us. They said they were impressed that our maize did well without using organic fertilizer, so they suggested that we should find a small piece of land to use as a demonstration plot. And, after harvesting, they suggested that we should measure the harvest. In so doing, we will learn the positive impacts of bio-fertilizer on top of other things."
16,2022-07-21,39," **Interviewer**: When you use inorganic fertilizer, how many bags of maize do you produce on that very same plot? Do you harvest the same number of bags, or is it less or more this time?","This was my first time, and they said we should expect more next time since this was our first time. They even showed me pictures and videos of another user who uses biogas bio-fertilizer on a 3-hectare land, and I must say I was very impressed by the maize. I was also told to try applying the biofertiliser on other piece of land, if I was satisfied with the maize I got last time. I will definitely do it, because, if I had not used the biofertiliser last year, I wouldn't have gotten anything because government subsidy fertilizer was very scarce last time. This year, I feel like we don't even have a choice, but to use bio-fertilizer since it will be difficult to get fertilizer as the number of beneficiaries of subsidy fertilizer has been reduced greatly and the price of fertilizer is out of reach now."
16,2022-07-21,40," **Interviewer**: yeah, this year it will be even more difficult to get fertilizer.","Yeah, this is the right time to use our biogas in farming."
16,2022-07-21,41," **Interviewer**: What were your expectations? But before we go to that, did you know about biogas before Ecogen came to SHMPA? How did you learn about biogas?","We learned about biogas when they came. Before that, I was only seeing adverts on TV of people cooking using LPG gas and I was very much surprised to see that happening in Malawi. So, when they came, we told them that we had seen people using gas, but this was different because it used cow manure. We even thought that it was better because it's somewhat free since it uses free cow manure. It's also better than electricity, because electricity is expensive, it can't be accessed everywhere, and it\'s very much unreliable these days because the power outages are something else... Biogas is very easy for me to use, because I have cow manure."
16,2022-07-21,42, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations of biogas?,"I was very happy, and expected my life to change and it has really changed."
16,2022-07-21,43," **Interviewer**: What has it changed? And, how did you expect your life to change?","I go to SHMPA very early as I'm the chair of the group. I go as early as 5 AM, so to look for firewood that time is difficult and time consuming. As a result, that time I was going without eating. Now, I'm able to turn the stove on and cook porridge with ease, as it is in the house. Now, I have also been told that I can use it for lighting as well as a power source for my TV. I did ask them if it's possible to use it for electricity last time when they came, and they told me that."
16,2022-07-21,44," **Interviewer**: What made you ask about that? I mean, how did you learn that? And, what's required for you now to use it for lighting and as a power source?","I was just curious. Talking of what is required; we have never been told what is required. But, next time they are here, I will ask them what we will need to have it produce energy for lighting."
16,2022-07-21,45," **Interviewer**: So far, are you happy with the digester?","Very much so. It is a good thing. I do believe other people like it too, but are put off by its cost; and now that I have seen it work, the cost is not that much, it worth the cost, especially when it\'s paid in 2 years."
16,2022-07-21,46," **Interviewer**: Yeah, K600000 in 2 years is not that much.",\[no response\]
16,2022-07-21,47," **Interviewer**: There two things you were told to expect; one was that you would be using it for cooking, two as fertilizer, and now you have learnt that you can use it for lighting. What else where you told to expect apart from these?","Uh, that's all. It was about using it on TV, radio as well as lighting. And, they did talk about this when I asked them, I think it was around the time they came to see the maize."
16,2022-07-21,48, **Interviewer**: Do they usually come?,"They do come often to see how we are doing. And, they even call to check in on us."
16,2022-07-21,49, **Interviewer**: How many times have they come? And when was the last time you talked with him?,"I do speak with them regularly. They even called me the day before yesterday. They also told me to call them whenever there is the problem, but since it was installed, we have never had any issues."
16,2022-07-21,50, **Interviewer**: Did you receive any training? Or is it just with training you and others received at SHMPA by the installers?,"No, that was it. But, the first time when they came at SHMPA, they were six men and some were from within. I know one is from Thonda, and the other is from Green Corner. At one point, it was producing little gas and we called Ecogen, and they sent those men to come and fix the digester. When they came, they simply replaced the filter and switched on the stove, and it worked out. Since then we have never had issues with it."
16,2022-07-21,51, **Interviewer**: How long did it take for this to happen?,I think it was after 5 months.
16,2022-07-21,52," **Interviewer**: So you only saw how they fixed the filter. Apart from that, is there anything else you were taught how to fix it?","No, that\'s all."
16,2022-07-21,53," **Interviewer**: During the meeting at SIMPA, what training did you receive? What did they say? Did they mention anything about how to fix it?","The just explained about how it works, how to operate it, and its importance. But, they did not teach us how to fix it. They just assured us that we will not have problems with it, and that we will use it for a long time."
16,2022-07-21,54, **Interviewer**: How long did they say it would last?, **Interviewee**: (Laughs) a very long time; 10 to 20 years.
16,2022-07-21,55," **Interviewer**: Mainly, why did you choose to have a biogas digester here?"," **Interviewee**: It was all to do with my waking up time. I wake up very early, and that time whenever I was going to SHMPA, I was going on an empty stomach. As a result, I was taking my high blood pressure medication without food. Then, I thought deep about it, and then came to a conclusion that I need it, since it was going to help me a lot in terms of my health. As we are speaking now, I can't go to SHMPA without eating, and I can certainly not take my BP medication without eating."
16,2022-07-21,56," **Interviewer**: You were going to SHMPA early in the morning and taking medication without food, tell....... \[Interrupted\]"," **Interviewee**: I go early, maybe around five in the morning. So, basically in the morning, I boil water on one burner, and on the other burner, I cook porridge. But, I haven't literally stopped cooking on firewood, because I cook thobwa (sweet beer) and the pot I use for cooking thobwa doesn't fit on the biogas stove."
16,2022-07-21,57, **Interviewer**: What was it like taking medication without eating?," **Interviewee**: It was bad because I was feeling very hungry and weak at the same time. Then, I would soldier on, and come home to eat, or I would buy food from the tuck shops after some time. It wasn't good for my health - it was killing me slowly."
16,2022-07-21,58," **Interviewer**: Before the biogas, what were you using for energy, for example, cooking?", **Interviewee**: Firewood and charcoal
16,2022-07-21,59, **Interviewer**: Where do you get firewood?," **Interviewee**: I get it from mango trees and blue gum trees, which we have around the house. We have lots of bluegum trees because I planted them to use them for construction of cow house. You can't buy bluegum, because it's very expensive these days."
16,2022-07-21,60, **Interviewer**: How much charcoal do you buy or use?," **Interviewee**: I don\'t usually use charcoal. I use firewood because I have enough trees around. Now, I have plenty of firewood in store to use during the rainy season. Nonetheless, I buy theK300 packs of charcoal, which was previously at K200, sometimes."
16,2022-07-21,61," **Interviewer**: Roughly, how many times do you buy charcoal per month?"," **Interviewee**: Maybe 10 times, I don\'t really count though."
16,2022-07-21,62, **Interviewer**: How do you differentiate between cooking on biogas and cooking on charcoal or firewood?," **Interviewee**: I do differentiate. Cooking on biogas is faster than cooking on charcoal or firewood, if you feed the digester properly. Biogas is very fast!"
16,2022-07-21,63, **Interviewer**: What else apart from that? I remember the last time I came alone you told me it doesn't blacken pots with soot.," **Interviewee**: Yes, it doesn\'t produce soot. As a result, you can use a pot three or four times without cleaning it, because it doesn't blackened pots with soot. While, when you use firewood you are forced to clean the pot every time after cooking. I remember one time they came and took a video of us cooking on firewood. After that, they took another video of us cooking on biogas. The pot that was used for cooking on firewood turned out be very black because of the smoke."
16,2022-07-21,64," **Interviewer**: At this time, are you satisfied with the fire you are getting from your digester?"," **Interviewee**: I can say, yes. We onlyget little gas if we don't feed it, and when we feed it again, we get strong flames - and it's not like we need to feed it every day to get strong flames,for example, if we can feed it today, after three days we can still get strong flames."
16,2022-07-21,65, **Interviewer**: How many cows do you have?," **Interviewee**: I have six cows and one calf, which has just been born."
16,2022-07-21,66, **Interviewer**: That\'s like you have seven in total., **Interviewee**: Yeah
16,2022-07-21,67," **Interviewer**: Before thedigester, what were you doing with the cow manure?"," **Interviewee**: Previously, I was using cow manure in my farm as fertilizer, and I was also selling the manure."
16,2022-07-21,68," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay..."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I sell 50 kg of cow manure at K250."
16,2022-07-21,69, **Interviewer**: Only K250? Is that not cheap?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I sell at a give away price. I remember at some point there was a certain manwho was coming repeatedly to buy cow manurefrom me, and then I learned from my friends that person was selling the cowmanure at K500 elsewhere."
16,2022-07-21,70, **Interviewer**: When was that?," **Interviewee**: Last year, and this year alone I have sold K4000 worth of manure."
16,2022-07-21,71," **Interviewer**: Wow, that's like how many bags?", **Interviewee**: (laughs) a lot of bags.
16,2022-07-21,72," **Interviewer**: We have done half of the interview. We are remaining with roughly the same time. Moving forward, how did the system work after commissioning?"," **Interviewee**: It started perfectly, and even the installers who were present on the day it was commissioned were impressed. But, it was difficult for me to operate during the first days. Luckily enough, my daughter who understood it was around. So, yeah, during the first days, I was getting confused, and I was forgetting the information they passed to me, I think because I'm old and I was given too much information at once. Good enough, my son was also there when they were installing it, so he understood it and he was able to operate it and was also able to prepare the feedstock. What happens is, when we get cow manure from the cow house, we soak it in a bucket, and then we start pouring water. Then, we stir it till it gets between thick and runny. Afterwards, we remove trash from the feedstock in order to have feedstock without weeds, stalks that can block it. Then, we pour the feedstock into the digester and start stepping on the bag to kick-start it, and after doing that we get strong flames on the burner, which sometimes ignites the other burner without lighting it with a matchstick."
16,2022-07-21,73," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's strange. How much gas did it produce? I mean, how much cooking time did you get from this?"," **Interviewee**: We are able to cook breakfast, lunch and supper without any problems \[2 hours -- 3 hours\]."
16,2022-07-21,74," **Interviewer**: Even now? Doyou still get enough gas to cook breakfast, lunch and supper? I mean, is it the same? How much cooking time do you get?"," **Interviewee**: It's the same, and there\'s no problem. But, my friend told me that she has a problem with her digester.The gas valve has gotten broken, and it\'s not working. I believe someone must have pushed it with more force than necessary because certain times the gas valve is hard to move, so it makes you move it with unnecessary force just to make it work. She told me that she has contacted the installers and they told her that they would come to fix it. I believe they will go to fix it. But as far as I\'m concerned, since they commissioned my digester, I have only had an issue with the filter, which I communicated to them and they fixed it."
16,2022-07-21,75, **Interviewer**: What is this filter? Where is it located?, **Interviewee**: Let me show you.
16,2022-07-21,76, **Interviewer**: That's okay; you can show me at the end.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it\'s more less like mesh wire scourer, like the one we use for cleaning pots. Our digester stopped, so we only replaced the filter and it worked. Last year during the heavy rainy season, I worried and thought that I might not be able to get enough gas because they said it slows down when it cold. But, that was wrong because it was producing enough gas."
16,2022-07-21,77, **Interviewer**: It didn\'t slow down?," **Interviewee**: It didn\'t slow down as we were feeding it as usual, and when the sun was out the digester bag was able to inflate again. And, even when the bag wasn't full, we were still able to cook."
16,2022-07-21,78, **Interviewer**: Do you use the gas for any other purpose other than cooking? Is it strictly for cooking?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it is strictly cooking."
16,2022-07-21,79, **Interviewer**: Do you store your gas?, **Interviewee**: We don\'t have the material for storing gas.
16,2022-07-21,80, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?, **Interviewee**: We only require cow manure.
16,2022-07-21,81," **Interviewer**: And water, I guess."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we require cow manure, which we mix with water to have suitable slurry."
16,2022-07-21,82, **Interviewer**: Where do you get the water?, **Interviewee**: We have a borehole there.
16,2022-07-21,83," **Interviewer**: 50 meters! Okay, how much do you feed the digester?", **Interviewee**: Two buckets (20 liters) of cow manure and four buckets (20 liters) of water.
16,2022-07-21,84, **Interviewer**: Then you mix?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we mix with our hands."
16,2022-07-21,85, **Interviewer**: You use hands?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we use hands."
16,2022-07-21,86, **Interviewer**: Bare hands?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we use bare hands, so thatwe are able to remove the rubbish from feedstock effectively and efficiently."
16,2022-07-21,87, **Interviewer**: You can at least use groves.," **Interviewee**: It's hard to find gloves. But, yeah, gloves are good -- I agree that gloves are good. Still, you know we interact with cow manure on a daily basis, so we don't find it gross."
16,2022-07-21,88," **Interviewer**: Yeah, when you deal with it on a daily basis, you get used to it."," **Interviewee**: But, we need to find gloves."
16,2022-07-21,89, **Interviewer**: Why do you say?, **Interviewee**: (Laughs) Good hygiene practice!
16,2022-07-21,90, **Interviewer**: Who is responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: My son and daughter, who has gone to the hospital with her child.know when to feed it; they know that after 2 or 3 days, it must be fed."
16,2022-07-21,91, **Interviewer**: How do they about feeding it? Don't they complain?," **Interviewee**: No, no, they do everything quite okay - and as for my son, he knows everything about cows; when cows are on heat, he's able to make them mate; even now, he does clean the tits of the cow and milk; he is also responsible for feeding the cows, even though, he gets help sometimes from other people. He does everything."
16,2022-07-21,92, **Interviewer**: Did he receive training on biogas?,"(call his son) Chris! Chris! Were you taught on biogas? (Son confirms that he was trained) yeah, he was taught. He does everything; feeding and operating it. He\'s able to cook nsima on biogas; He even knows a lot more than I do; He taught me some of the things too, and now mom is good -- Youngsters learn faster that adults, you know!"
16,2022-07-21,93," **Interviewer**: (laughs) yeah, what were and are maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: He and his sister know how to maintain it; when it's not producing gas, they are also able to troubleshoot the problem; they know when it\'s not producing gas it is because of the filter or the feedstock. But, since it was installed, it has never really failed. \[Asks son if it has ever failed and the son confirmed that it has never felt before\]"
16,2022-07-21,94," **Interviewer**: Okay, does it meet your needs?", **Interviewee**: Yes! We cook quit okay.
16,2022-07-21,95, **Interviewer**: What challenges are you encountering now?," **Interviewee**: There is no problem; I am the problem, I\'m failing to pay for it."
16,2022-07-21,96," **Interviewer**: (Laughs) you will pay them, and you have already started paying too -- plus now that you have a cow, which you can milk, you will be good."," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) yeah, I even told them that."
16,2022-07-21,97," **Interviewer**: You have told me you cook thobwa, and you don\'t use the biogas stove because the pot doesn\'t fit. Don\'t you think this is a challenge or limitation with your biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I cook a lot of thobwa at once and I need a big pot. Sadly, it doesn't fit on the stove. Still, I use it when I want to cook a small quantity of thobwa and fast. On the whole, because of my business, I need a big pot, hence I use firewood."
16,2022-07-21,98, **Interviewer**: How big is your pot?, **Interviewee**: It is 60 liters.
16,2022-07-21,99," **Interviewer**: Have you encountered any problem? I mean, I'm thinking of the times you put stones or a sandbag on top of your digester bag. You also mentioned....."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we were advised not to use stones too often because theymay damage the digester bag -- and they made it pretty clear that we should a bag of sand. But, the sack we usually use got damaged because of the rains hence we are forced to use stones."
16,2022-07-21,100," **Interviewer**: What I mean is, using a sack bag to make it work properly is a problem, what do you think?"," **Interviewee**: Putting a bag of sand on top of the digester bag is not a problem, and it's not like we do that all the times. We do that; and we have no problem with that; and it works."
16,2022-07-21,101, **Interviewer**: I remember you said it failed once and you called them to fix it. Take me through that.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, there was a time when we switched it on and it did not produce gas. We tried to find the problem and fix it, but we couldn't, so we called the owner of the installation company who sent his boys. So, when they came they just went straight to the filter and they replaced it. After that, they asked the children to jump on the bag, and then it started working again."
16,2022-07-21,102, **Interviewer**: How long did it take?, **Interviewee**: It did not take long
16,2022-07-21,103," **Interviewer**: I mean, how long did it take this to happen?"," **Interviewee**: When we called them, they came on the same day, and they didn't take long. It rained that day, and I wondered how they even traveled from Green Corner to this place- and when they came, we told them the problem and that\'s when they went straight to the filter."
16,2022-07-21,104, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. Were you given something like this? What do you think about this information and do you think it is helpful?," **Interviewee**: No, we were not; we were only told. But, it seems like they will be here again soon, so I'm going to ask for a handout. People do come to see this and we fail to explain some of the things, so I believe this will help us in that regard... I remember, last month \[name redacted\], an ex employee of Escom came to appreciate the digester. He said he wants to install one at his place because he has cattle. I do not only receive visitors who have cattle, people who don't have cattle come here to appreciate the digester too. They take pictures and all. However, their concern is mostly on cow manure; they wonder if people who have cattle would be willing to share them manure. But, I tell them people would be willing to share manure for three or four times, and after that they will ask for money because they will think you buying firewood from them."
16,2022-07-21,105, **Interviewer**: What do you think of this information?, **Interviewee**: It can help.
16,2022-07-21,106, **Interviewer**: Why and how?," **Interviewee**: Sometimes we do forget some of the things that we been taught. So with this, it can be easy to access the information. Also, whenever there is a problem, one can easily look at the information, troubleshoot, and fix the digester. For example, when it's not working, one can look at the cause, find the solution and act accordingly, and eventually bring the digester back to life with the help of this information\...\... I may forget what I was taught and my children might not be around, and that would be disastrous. But, this can help me in such a case.... Luckily enough now, I have children who can fix this or remind me some of the things."
16,2022-07-21,107," **Interviewer**: Oh, you are really proud of your children. Do you know how to read? Can you be able to decipher this?","Yes, I can read. But, I can only read Chichewa. So, the information needs to be in Chichewa (Laughs). Also, the text needs to be big. I'm old, so the font needs to be like on that calendar \[Calibri 18/20\]."
16,2022-07-21,108," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Okay, what is the current state of your digester?", **Interviewee**: It's working okay; it has no issues.
16,2022-07-21,109," **Interviewer**: Your digester is working okay, but most people's digesters are not. Why do you think people are not able to maintain them? I mean, how have you managed to keep it in this state?"," **Interviewee**: Oh, what type of problems do they face?"
16,2022-07-21,110," **Interviewer**: Some have digester bag punctured, the fitting issues, and leakages.", **Interviewee**: Can the bug get punctured? What can puncture it? Do you mean people puncture it deliberately?
16,2022-07-21,111," **Interviewer**: Accidentally, we have also seen problems associated with connections, especially gas connector.", **Interviewee**: Which kind of digester? This group?
16,2022-07-21,112," **Interviewer**: Not this types though, some other type?"," **Interviewee**: With the experience we have had with it, I don't think that can happen."
16,2022-07-21,113, **Interviewer**: Why do you think you have been able to maintain this up to date? What are you doing?," **Interviewee**: It's about management and following the instructions; If you are told to feed it with cow manure and water, and you do the contrary by feeding it with water only, then you are bringing trouble to yourself when you know what ought to be done. We were also told to ensure that there is no water in the pipes, so if we do not remove water that accumulates in the pipes at the water trap, then we have a problem. We may be feeding it as required, but it may not work. So, you need to follow all the instructions. When it comes to other issues, I'm not concerned, because when I look at the digester bag I don't think it can be punctured easily. And, if it takes a sharp object to puncture it, then it has to be very strong and sharp. But, I only ask myself questions; since we have been feeding it for some time now, is the digester not decomposing underneath? And, if the bag gets damaged, how would we remove the digestate? And, I get surprised that when we step or out a heavy load on the digester, it starts overflowing with slurry at the outlet. And, that's why we have covered with an iron sheet because we don't want the chickens to fall into it.... And, we use the slurry as fertilizer."
16,2022-07-21,114, **Interviewer**: What do you do with the bio-slurry? You said you use it as fertilizer for your crops?," **Interviewee**: We use it in the farm, and in the tomato garden; because we were told that we can use it as manure for our tomatoes."
16,2022-07-21,115, **Interviewer**: Do you sell?," **Interviewee**: Of course, I will start selling because I have seen how effective it is, and people have shown interest as well."
16,2022-07-21,116, **Interviewer**: At what price do you intend to sell effluent or digestate?," **Interviewee**: Considering how high the price of fertilizer has gone up, I will be selling the effluent at K3000 per 20-liter effluent -- and that's even cheap when you consider its benefits and the high price of fertilizer now."
16,2022-07-21,117," **Interviewer**: It's really expensive, K70000 - that's tough. So you said it did cost you K600000 to get this, are you paying on your own?"," **Interviewee**: Yes and my children will support me because for the cow to be on heat again it will take another five months. So, if I get good quality milk, I will be able to pay. But, if the milk turns out sour, then I will have issues paying, because people buy sour milk at a cheap price and with hesitancy."
16,2022-07-21,118," **Interviewer**: There are some things that were brought by Ecogen, and there are some things that you provided to have all that working, which things did you contribute on the digester?"," **Interviewee**: Everything was brought by Ecogen. The only thing that is mine there is the filter. My daughter bought three of them after the original filter failed, just in case the filter fails again. Still, I don't think the original filter failed completely, because it didn't take long, so maybe they just wanted to replace it. On top of the filter, I can say I made this structure where I put the stove. If I had not made that, they would have placed the stove on a brick structure. So, basically I didn't spend money on anything else."
16,2022-07-21,119, **Interviewer**: How much did the filters cost?," **Interviewee**: It's basically the kitchen wire scourer, so it's very cheap. So, she bought three of them at K600."
16,2022-07-21,120, **Interviewer**: How much did the structure for you stove cost?," **Interviewee**: I think it was K12000. I paid the person who built it K2000. I bought of cement at K8000 that time, and the bricks I just got from someone else for free. It wasn't many bricks; it was less than 20."
16,2022-07-21,121, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the five-liter bottle for storing effluent I saw?," **Interviewee**: Yes, they brought that."
16,2022-07-21,122, **Interviewer**: How many?, **Interviewee**: I was given one and \[name redacted\] was also given one.
16,2022-07-21,123, **Interviewer**: How much labour went into this? How many laborers did you provide?, **Interviewee**: I had two boys who did the digging.
16,2022-07-21,124," **Interviewer**: And after the installers saw that the hole wasn't dug as they wanted they made adjustments. Apart from that, was there any other work that was done?"," **Interviewee**: They simply put the digester bag in the hole, but before that they laid something like a blanket underneath."
16,2022-07-21,125," **Interviewer**: Okay, and then the construction made on the stove.", **Interviewee**: Yeah -- right.
16,2022-07-21,126," **Interviewer**: What kind of special items had to be imported from another country? In your opinion, is this something from Malawi?"," **Interviewee**: I even asked myself that question, is this thing from Malawi or another country? But, when I asked the installers if they were from Malawi, they said they are from Malawi. So, maybe they have people outside Malawi who import these things here."
16,2022-07-21,127, **Interviewer**: Why makes you say so? Why do you think people from outside the country are involved?," **Interviewee**: When I looked at the digester bag that day, I doubted if it was made here in Malawi. So, maybe they work with white people since they are educated, just like you are doing now. But, the installer is from Lilongwe..... Right now, I'm starting to think that this thing is from Malawi because of the people you have come with to see the digester. If they had this in their country, then they wouldn't have come."
16,2022-07-21,128, **Interviewer**: (laugh) interesting. How much money are you saving now?," **Interviewee**: I'm saving a lot of money because I no longer use charcoal or firewood for cooking; It is only when I cook thobwa that I use firewood. I have to say that the digester is doing its job and it's helping -- and I truly appreciate Ecogen. I can only show my appreciation by paying the loan as we agreed. I do appreciate their patience as well, because of the way I have not been paying the loan; if it was Escom power, I'm sure they would have come to disconnect it."
16,2022-07-21,129, **Interviewer**: You are now saving the K300s you were spending on charcoal and all that....," **Interviewee**: It's really a lot....... I'm saving! Now, I will be recording all expenses on charcoal to get the exact figure. But, I can't say I spend more than K10000 a month."
16,2022-07-21,130, **Interviewer**: Where do you get the charcoal?," **Interviewee**: I buy packs from the market for cooking thobwa as well. In regards to other expenses on thobwa, I do record. For example, I record the cost maize, sugar and labour, so for that I know."
16,2022-07-21,131, **Interviewer**: What's the main difference now that you have biogas?," **Interviewee**: It was difficult to serve visitors who came and stayed for a short time. Now I'm able to make tea for visitors in very short time. Now my visitors cannot come and go hungry. In the past, it was very difficult for me to ignite charcoal and make tea for my visitors. I also feel happy in my heart now that I'm able to utilize cow manure fully. I'm proud of the extension worker who brought Ecogen here. We are proud of them because they bring things good for community development, and one example is the biogas. As for people who are not developing it's their own fault, but we have people on the ground working to ensure that our community is developing."
16,2022-07-21,132, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I can only say thanks to them and that there is nothing disappointing about the digester. And, I don't think the digester can be broken easily. You said that digester bag gets punctured; I think that can only be done by jealous people. I don't think a person from within can damage this because the plastic bag is durable and to puncture it may need someone to go to a tinsmith to sharpen a knife and cut it on purpose. Nonetheless, I did express concerns that the people may damage it on purpose, because sometimes people do cut my trees without my consent and even steal fruits. But, they assured me that people couldn't manage to cut of the digester bag. The same was also said about the pipes. They said people couldn't manage to cut the pipes with a knife. Then, I also raised concerns that people may steal it since it stays outside. They said it was not easy for people to still it because it's heavy and people cannot manage to carry it, and that also the stove is inside. I had all these questions but when I brought the questions to them, they laughed them off."
16,2022-07-21,133," **Interviewer**: Last question, if you could have designed your waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: In my entire life, I have always wanted this kind of cooking. Of course, people do use LPG gas for cooking, but that also needs money, unlike this. I have free cow manure and I don't need to buy LPG gas for cooking, so I do not envy them at all. I feel very excited and joyful. People have shown great interest in it, but don't have cow manure - and when they think of buying cow manure, they are put off. But as for me, I can only say, I'm very excited with this."
16,2022-07-21,134, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: Though people do show interest, it's not strong enough because of money or cow manure. Now, people from this community have seen how this thing is helping me and can agree that we don't use and need charcoal anymore. So, this is the way to go for Malawians. We have rainfall problems and where do you think that is coming from? It's coming from people who are cutting down trees for charcoal production. Yes, of course, people do plant trees, but they are not planting indigenous trees, which people use for charcoal production. We are destroying the environment -- we are destroying nature....... Biogas has many benefits, and it even works during the rainyseason long as it's fed -- and they say if it produces little gas, we just need to put a bag of sand on top of digester bag, and surely, when we do that we get strong flames and we even wonder where all that gas is coming from."
16,2022-07-21,135, **Interviewer**: Interesting! That was my last question. Thanks for the interview,NA
17,2022-07-22,1, **Interviewer**: Where did this digester originate from?, **Interviewee**: It came from Green Malata.
17,2022-07-22,2," **Interviewer**: Okay, Who designed it?", **Interviewee**: It is Green Malata.
17,2022-07-22,3," **Interviewer**: Okay, who built it?"," **Interviewee**: Green Malata did everything, including the funding."
17,2022-07-22,4," **Interviewer**: When was it built? And, how long did it take to build?", **Interviewee**: It was built in a week. It has been 3 years now.
17,2022-07-22,5, **Interviewer**: How many people from Green Malata built this?, **Interviewee**: 3 people.
17,2022-07-22,6, **Interviewer**: How many people from your side assisted in the construction of this digester?, **Interviewee**: It was 4 people.
17,2022-07-22,7, **Interviewer**: What was your role?," **Interviewee**: Basically, we were only supporting them. They did everything."
17,2022-07-22,8, **Interviewer**: What did you support them in?," **Interviewee**: We supported them in constructing of the whole digester; Thus, we assisted them in digging of the hole, making of feedstock, and assembling of the digester."
17,2022-07-22,9," **Interviewer**: Okay, how were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: The Senior Chief is a friend of the white person at Green Malata. So, the white person thought it wise to build a digester here."
17,2022-07-22,10," **Interviewer**: Okay, nice. How did you participate in the selection process?", **Interviewee**: It was very much the decision of the white man to assist the senior chief with gas for cooking.
17,2022-07-22,11, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't know anything about biogas. We were even surprised what it was. So, after installation of the digester they gave us storage bags to use for harvesting gas."
17,2022-07-22,12, **Interviewer**: How did it feel to get the digester?," **Interviewee**: We embraced it but the only problem was that the storage bag developed a problem; it started leaking gas as it had a puncture, and it was very hard for us to replace."
17,2022-07-22,13, **Interviewer**: How did it start leaking gas?," **Interviewee**: It started leaking gas on its own. So, after harvesting gas from the digester bag, gas was escaping from the storage bag."
17,2022-07-22,14," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were your expectations of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: We didn't expect to get biogas from Green Malata, so it came as a surprise. We didn't believe that we could get a digester, something we didn't know at the time. So, we were worried that we would not manage to operate it. But, after they explained to us about it, we started using it without problems; it was simple, we simply harvested gas, and then used the gas for cooking food on the stove. Thus, we had high expectation of cooking on biogas without challenges."
17,2022-07-22,15, **Interviewer**: Oh nice. What did the installers tell you to expect from the digester?," **Interviewee**: Initially, they told us its feedstock, which was animal manure, or banana leaves mixed with sugar. Then, they told us that after feeding the bag, it would be producing gas and cause the digester bag to fill with gas. So, when we saw that the digester bag full, we were getting the storage bag to harvest gas. After harvesting gas, we used to connect the storage bag to the stove and start using the gas for cooking."
17,2022-07-22,16, **Interviewer**: How big was your storage bag?," **Interviewee**: It was fairly big. But, it was not big as the digester bag."
17,2022-07-22,17, **Interviewer**: Like a 50 kg sack bag?," **Interviewee**: No, it was bigger than a 50 kg sack bag. I think it was similar to 2 sack bags (50kg) \[100 -- 200 liters of gas\]"
17,2022-07-22,18," **Interviewer**: So, you were taught how to harvest gas?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they taught us."
17,2022-07-22,19,How did you harvest gas specifically?," **Interviewee**: We were connecting the storage bag to the digester and a pump. So, gas was moving from the digester to the storage."
17,2022-07-22,20, **Interviewer**: Was it hard?," **Interviewee**: No, it wasn't."
17,2022-07-22,21, **Interviewer**: What type of training did you receive?, **Interviewee**: We didn't have any training.
17,2022-07-22,22," **Interviewer**: Ah, is it possible."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we had no training. They just explained to us certain things, so we were doing what they explained to us."
17,2022-07-22,23, **Interviewer**: What did they explain?," **Interviewee**: They told us that if we wanted to cook or harvest gas, we should be feeding the digester with manure. Then, we should be connecting the storage bag to the stove to cook. So, gas was moving from the digester bag, and then to the storage bag, and then to the stove for usage."
17,2022-07-22,24, **Interviewer**: What else?, **Interviewee**: That was all. I believe we would have learned more if we had training.
17,2022-07-22,25," **Interviewer**: Out of curiosity, what you were told is that not training?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) It's different because at training you learn more. I feel there was a lot more we could have learn, and I'm sure it would have been working today, if they trained us. If we had training, we would have known where to get storage bags, how to fix them or even how to improvise. And, I'm very certain that if we knew where to buy a storage bag, we would have tried our best, even to a point of getting a loan, to buy the storage bag, if we knew where to find them."
17,2022-07-22,26, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you want? What kind of training did you have in mind?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) We expected then to tell us how to fix issues, for example, how to fix leakages on the storage bags; where do we find the storage bags. If they had given us this kind of information, I would have made porridge for you today to see how it works because it could have been working."
17,2022-07-22,27," **Interviewer**: So, the so-called training was basically on operation, and not maintenance.", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
17,2022-07-22,28," **Interviewer**: You know nothing stays forever. Even if you get a bike, it has its own issues with time. Why didn't you ask them to train you on maintenance?"," **Interviewee**: It's true, we didn't ask them, but we should have asked them to. But, after it broke, they came twice so we expected them to tell us where to get the bag or something. But, they never said anything."
17,2022-07-22,29, **Interviewer**: How prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were after all that?," **Interviewee**: We were so confident that we would operate it, and we were really using it. We were able to boil water, and cook on it."
17,2022-07-22,30," **Interviewer**: You had all the right to deny the digester, why did you accept it to be built here?"," **Interviewee**: We accepted it because it saves firewood. With a digester, you don't need to move around searching for firewood. So, we saw that it was good because it would enable us to cook without firewood, and also give us a chance to stop cutting trees in the forests."
17,2022-07-22,31, **Interviewer**: Is it different to source feedstock to make fireand to source firewood to make fire. Isn't that the same?," **Interviewee**: Oh, it's different. With biogas, you simply ask for manure or buy the manure, and then make feedstock. While with firewood, you go to the forest, and sometimes forest officials catch you. Moreover, trees are planted to save the environment, and when you cut a tree, you damage the environment. You can't keep cutting trees and expect things to be okay. So, that comes with serious consequences, for example, rainfall shortages. Also, the dwellings and the environment we live in look pleasant because of trees. So, it's very different."
17,2022-07-22,32, **Interviewer**: What did the people from Green Malata tell you to expect from this? What was your first encounter with them like?," **Interviewee**: They had a discussion with the Senior Chief that they wanted to bring biogas for cooking, so he accepted it. And, it was easy for him to accept it because he is always moving around, so he must have seen this somewhere."
17,2022-07-22,33, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) we were cooking on things that get you in trouble with forest officials \[firewood\]. And, even now, we have reverted to that. It is just like we took a short break! But, we have reverted to firewood, simply because the digester malfunctioned."
17,2022-07-22,34, **Interviewer**: Where do get the firewood?, **Interviewee**: In the forest where the Luchenza river flows.
17,2022-07-22,35," **Interviewer**: Ah, do you have forest officials there?"," **Interviewee**: yeah, the government through the forest department protects it. They protect the forest to keep the river intact because it supplies drinking water to many."
17,2022-07-22,36, **Interviewer**: What's the name of the forest?," **Interviewee**: It's G something... I have forgotten it's full name. But, it starts with a G."
17,2022-07-22,37," **Interviewer**: So, the government protects it."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and when you are caught they give out heavy punishment and huge fines."
17,2022-07-22,38," **Interviewer**: How big are the fines? And, have you been caught?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) Oh, no. We just try to avoid that by not going there. So, we just buy from the people who get the firewood from there."
17,2022-07-22,39," **Interviewer**: Oh, I wouldn't imagine a chief going there to cut and steal trees..."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and at first people were very skeptical about selling us the firewood. They thought we would report them to the officials."
17,2022-07-22,40," **Interviewer**: I would think the same too. So, you rely on firewood in terms of cooking."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that's our reliable source of energy for cooking."
17,2022-07-22,41, **Interviewer**: Charcoal?," **Interviewee**: No, it's not common here."
17,2022-07-22,42, **Interviewer**: Why not?," **Interviewee**: When you compare the price of charcoal and firewood, there is a difference. Firewood is cheaper; a bundle of firewood is at K3000, while a bag of charcoal starts at K8000 going upwards."
17,2022-07-22,43," **Interviewer**: How much firewood do you use or buy in a day, week or month?", **Interviewee**: I don't record that information.
17,2022-07-22,44, **Interviewer**: Just an estimation...," **Interviewee**: Maybe, I use firewood of K1000 per day."
17,2022-07-22,45, **Interviewer**: How much were you saving on firewood that time?, **Interviewee**: I was saving money because I wasn't buying firewood.
17,2022-07-22,46, **Interviewer**: You were not buying firewood at all?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was cooking everything on biogas, excluding beans. I was even warming bathing water on it."
17,2022-07-22,47, **Interviewer**: Why not beans?," **Interviewee**: It was taking long to cook beans, and gas was finishing even before the beans got cooked \[cooking time of less than two hours\]."
17,2022-07-22,48," **Interviewer**: But, you were able to cook nsima...."," **Interviewee**: I was able to cook nsima, light side dishes, porridge for the kids and all that."
17,2022-07-22,49, **Interviewer**: Howdo you differentiate cooking on biogas and cooking on firewood?," **Interviewee**: The good thing with biogas is that you don't need to blow the fire constantly with air to keep it blazing; So, you simply put a pot on the stove and cook your things without doing anything else. It's different. And, it's fast."
17,2022-07-22,50, **Interviewer**: Is the taste the same?, **Interviewee**: The taste was the same.
17,2022-07-22,51, **Interviewer**: Did you have livestock that time?," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't have."
17,2022-07-22,52, **Interviewer**: What were you supposed to feed it again?," **Interviewee**: Cow manure, food waste, banana leaves. So, we used to mix these things together, and then add sugar. I think we had a mix, which was crushing these things together before feeding the digester."
17,2022-07-22,53, **Interviewer**: Like how much sugar?, **Interviewee**: Just a cup of sugar; the common blue cup for drinking tea \[250 g\]
17,2022-07-22,54, **Interviewer**: How did you manage food waste and banana leaves before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: We used to throw them away because we didn't know how to use them productively.
17,2022-07-22,55, **Interviewer**: Okay. How much feedstock did you start it with?," **Interviewee**: I don't know, because I wasn't involved in that process. Men only did the work as they didn't come with any female."
17,2022-07-22,56, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up?, **Interviewee**: It didn't take long; it didn't take more than a month.
17,2022-07-22,57, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: After harvesting gas in a storage bag, we were able to use the gas with no problem."
17,2022-07-22,58, **Interviewer**: How often did you harvest the gas?," **Interviewee**: Usually, we harvested gas once a day. But, when gas was finished in the storage bag, we used to harvest gas again, if we saw that the digester bag had gas. So, we were harvesting gas twice a day sometimes, but it was usually once in a day. But, the gas that we produced, depended on the amount of feedstock that was fed."
17,2022-07-22,59, **Interviewer**: How much cooking time did you get from it? How did yourday look like in regards to cooking?," **Interviewee**: If we filled the storage bag, we were able to cook the whole day. If the storage bag wasn't full, we used to cook in the morning and at lunch."
17,2022-07-22,60," **Interviewer**: What times were you not able to fill your storage bag? Or, why was your storage bag not full sometimes?"," **Interviewee**: During the dry season, we used to harvest more gas because gas production process was happening fast around that time. In cold season, it was taking time tofill the bag because the process was slow."
17,2022-07-22,61, **Interviewer**: I understand digester produce effluent that is used as fertilizer. What did you do with your effluent?," **Interviewee**: We didn't know what to do with it, so we used to dispose of in the field."
17,2022-07-22,62, **Interviewer**: You were told about it?, **Interviewee**: No.
17,2022-07-22,63, **Interviewer**: Seriously?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. If they did, they told only my husband. But, if he was told, he would have told me without a doubt because that's a very crucial thing. So, as far as I know, we weren't told about the digestate."
17,2022-07-22,64, **Interviewer**: What were the operationrequirements?," **Interviewee**: To start it up we used those two containers (100 liters), and 4 other containers that were for collecting water or for mixing the feedstock. In total, we had 6 containers, so 3 were for cow manure and 3 water. So, we mixed it until we got suitable slurry."
17,2022-07-22,65, **Interviewer**: How big were the other 4 containers?," **Interviewee**: I think they contained 4 or 5 buckets of 20 liters. So, they were pretty much the same but different shapes."
17,2022-07-22,66,"Okay, how did you prepare the feedstock?"," **Interviewee**: We were mixing the feedstock together in a bucket until suitable slurry was reached. So, I think we were feeding it with 3 buckets of feedstock and 3 buckets of water every day, I think. I don't really remember because the garden boy was the one doing that. You are just unfortunate today that he is not around, but he is usually around."
17,2022-07-22,67," **Interviewer**: I will get his number at the end, so that I can communicate with him."," **Interviewee**: He doesn't have phone \[he had a very old phone that wasn't working work (boy voice in the background)\]. So, the garden boy knows a lot about feeding, and he can give you better answers on that question."
17,2022-07-22,68," **Interviewer**: Then, I will get your phone, so that when he comes you could notify me."," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) I don't have a phone too. I will write your phone number, so that I Can call you once I have a phone."
17,2022-07-22,69," **Interviewer**: That sounds like a plan. Or, I will use your husband's phone. But, I understand he is always moving. So, who was really responsible for feeding it? Is it the garden boy only?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, the garden boy who was feeding it."
17,2022-07-22,70, **Interviewer**: How did he describe that task?," **Interviewee**: It was a lot of work and he used to complain about it. But, he was motivated because the installers gave him a work suit.... But, on the first day, he complained a lot that he wasn't given money, because he felt the work was huge and hard on the first day. Also, he wanted a monthly salary for feeding the digester. But, we took it as a community thing, so there was no need to pay him money."
17,2022-07-22,71, **Interviewer**: Did it meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: It met our needs, but we can't say 100% because we were not able to cook beans."
17,2022-07-22,72," **Interviewer**: Apart from beans, what else were you not able to cook?", **Interviewee**: That was that!
17,2022-07-22,73, **Interviewer**: Side dish of beef?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we were able to cook that!"
17,2022-07-22,74, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: We had challenges in sourcing cow manure because some people would not share us because people use it for fertilizer. So, that was the only challenge."
17,2022-07-22,75, **Interviewer**: Was the fact that it didn't produce enough gas in cold season a problem?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that's was a challenge."
17,2022-07-22,76, **Interviewer**: How much cooking time did you get in wet season?," **Interviewee**: It was not much as in summer. So, we tried to use the gas economically. For example, we used to warm water on firewood instead of biogas."
17,2022-07-22,77, **Interviewer**: How did it stop working?, **Interviewee**: It stopped when a storage bag started leaking gas.
17,2022-07-22,78, **Interviewer**: How was it leaking gas?," **Interviewee**: It had a gas pipe, so gas started leaking where the pipe and the bag itself joined. I believe it wasn't manufactured properly. So, when we harvested the gas, it wasn't taking time to finish."
17,2022-07-22,79, **Interviewer**: How did the problem manifest?," **Interviewee**: It was taking long when we were cooking, so we knew that the gas was escaping somewhere. And, it even reached a stage where all the gas was escaping from the storage bag right at the point of collection."
17,2022-07-22,80, **Interviewer**: What did you do to fix it? Did you call Green Malata?," **Interviewee**: We reported to Green Malata and they brought a new storage bag. But, it also developed the same problem. And, it only took some months. I think it started leaking gas again after 6 months or a bit less. Then, we thought that we should not bother them again. So, we abandoned the digester."
17,2022-07-22,81, **Interviewer**: You shouldn't have given up....," **Interviewee**: No, we couldn't have been going there all the times. Morally, it's not right. So, we wanted to give them a break."
17,2022-07-22,82, **Interviewer**: Okay. How long did it take to come to fix the issue after you reported?," **Interviewee**: They were so fast; they came the day we reported. So, when they came they tried to seal the area that was leaking gas with seal tape. It worked for a month. So, we called them again, and when they saw that it didn't work, that's when they brought a new storage bag."
17,2022-07-22,83, **Interviewer**: How long did use it before it stopped?, **Interviewee**: We used it for a year.
17,2022-07-22,84, **Interviewer**: \[question inaudible\]," **Interviewee**: So the first storage bag only worked for 6 or 7 months, and then they replaced it with another bag with only worked for 6 months or less."
17,2022-07-22,85," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. Have you seen this \[table of Intervention\]? What do you think about this kind of information, and do you think it would have helped you?"," **Interviewee**: It would have helped because we would have been following the information. So, when there was a problem, we could have know the cause and fix it according to the information given."
17,2022-07-22,86," **Interviewer**: Let me get you on this, my understanding is that you knew the problem, so why didn't you try to fix it yourself?"," **Interviewee**: We tried to fix it using seal tape, but it didn't work."
17,2022-07-22,87, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of your digester?," **Interviewee**: It's not working, and we are not happy about it because we would have liked to use it to this day."
17,2022-07-22,88, **Interviewer**: Why are you not happy?," **Interviewee**: Because it was helping us a lot. Many people used to come to see it and they wanted it too in their houses. So, we were explaining to them what biogas is and all that. So, it's sad to tell them that it's dead."
17,2022-07-22,89, **Interviewer**: Do you think it will work again?," **Interviewee**: It would work again, if an organization can rehabilitate it and bring new storage bags. But, it would need a lot of effort and money because the sun damaged the digester bag, so it would need replacing too."
17,2022-07-22,90, **Interviewer**: How long did it take the digester bag to get damaged?," **Interviewee**: It got damaged some time after we abandoned it because maybe we wasn't using it. So, it could be a year or two after we stopped using it."
17,2022-07-22,91," **Interviewer**: Okay, How did it reach this stage?", **Interviewee**: It's in this stage because a storage bag got damaged.
17,2022-07-22,92, **Interviewer**: Is there anything else?," **Interviewee**: It's just that! But, if the had told us where we could find the bags I'm sure we could have done whatever it takes to buy the storage bag. If the bag was too expensive, we would have asked to pay on layby to get it."
17,2022-07-22,93, **Interviewer**: Why do you keep on saying that you could have gotten it on loan? Do you think you couldn't have managed it?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, we couldn't have afforded it."
17,2022-07-22,94, **Interviewer**: Do you know much it would cost?, **Interviewee**: I just think it\`s expensive.
17,2022-07-22,95, **Interviewer**: Like how much?, **Interviewee**: Maybe K200000 or K300000.
17,2022-07-22,96," **Interviewer**: With this big house, is that much?"," **Interviewee**: It's not our house. It's the government's house. We look respectable when we are there; but when we are moving and you see the furniture, you see that we have nothing."
17,2022-07-22,97," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Now that it's not working, how do meet your energy needs?", **Interviewee**: We still use firewood.
17,2022-07-22,98, **Interviewer**: How do you manage your feedstock now that it's now working?, **Interviewee**: We just throw away the food waste.
17,2022-07-22,99, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the banana leaves?, **Interviewee**: We have bananatrees behind the house.
17,2022-07-22,100, **Interviewer**: How did you manage banana leaves?, **Interviewee**: We just throw them away.
17,2022-07-22,101, **Interviewer**: Where?, **Interviewee**: In the refuse pit.
17,2022-07-22,102, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. How much did the reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: We just received it as a gift. So, we don't know how much was spent on the digester."
17,2022-07-22,103, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: We only contributed our energy in support the installation or construction of the digester.
17,2022-07-22,104, **Interviewer**: The cement?," **Interviewee**: They brought the cement, stove, and everything."
17,2022-07-22,105, **Interviewer**: How many people were involved in digging?, **Interviewee**: It was 3 people.
17,2022-07-22,106, **Interviewer**: Masonry work?, **Interviewee**: 5 people were involved in masonry work.
17,2022-07-22,107, **Interviewer**: Where did you get water?, **Interviewee**: We have a borehole within \[less than 100 meters.\]
17,2022-07-22,108, **Interviewer**: What kind of special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I can't know."
17,2022-07-22,109, **Interviewer**: Are you certain that it was saving you money the time it was working?," **Interviewee**: I'm very sure. As I said, we spend at least K1000 on firewood every day."
17,2022-07-22,110, **Interviewer**: What was the biggest change in your life the time you had biogas?," **Interviewee**: The biggest change was that when I was cooking on biogas I was able to do other things. While with firewood, you need to be there to maintain the fire."
17,2022-07-22,111, **Interviewer**: You seem you don't like blowing fire... what was the other change?," **Interviewee**: You don't need to blow the fire to keep it ablaze. If you are there for cooking, you only do the cooking and not focus on the fire. The other thing is that I'm asthmatic. Since it does not produce smoke, it wasn't exacerbating my situation. Previously, and even now, I struggle a lot with asthma because of the smoke."
17,2022-07-22,112, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. We have two questions remaining. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: To me biogas is helpful, very helpful. The time I had it I saw its benefits. For example, I was able to cook with ease."
17,2022-07-22,113, **Interviewer**: Tell me more how it's helpful..., **Interviewee**: It's easy to use; the other thing is that you don't need to search for firewood to cook.
17,2022-07-22,114, **Interviewer**: What's the future of biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: Biogas has a bright future. But, many people don't know about it. So, we need to publicize it, so that people can know it. I believe once people start to know how helpful to the environment it is, many people would adopt it. And, now you have enlightened me that you could get fertilizer out of it too. So, I would like it even more. Also, there is interest in biogas, because we saw a lot of people coming to see it. But, the only challenge is how to assess it. If the government or well-wishers can bring it to the people, I believe, many people would be willing to adopt it."
17,2022-07-22,115," **Interviewer**: You are saying it has a future.... I'll put it to you. You were given a biogas digester, but now you don't have it. So, where is the future there?"," **Interviewee**: On that, you can say it has no future because I failed to access the equipment. But, if the equipment were there, then we would have continued."
17,2022-07-22,116," **Interviewer**: What kind of equipment are you talking about? I mean, we have buckets, pipe here in Malawi."," **Interviewee**: I'm thinking of the digester bags, because I don't feel like we have them here in Malawi."
17,2022-07-22,117," **Interviewer**: So, for biogas to progress in Malawi it needs some of the equipment like the digester bags readily available. But, you don't think the bags are made in Malawi as well. So, that needs to change if we want biogas to progress as a nation. Last question. If you could have designed your own waste or anything intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I don't have any idea. But, I'll say biogas is a good innovation."
17,2022-07-22,118, **Interviewer**: What about a solar system?," **Interviewee**: We have a solar system here, but we don\'t know how we can make it produce energy for cooking."
17,2022-07-22,119, **Interviewer**: Okay cool.Thanks for the interview.,NA
18,2022-07-25,1," **Interviewer**: First question, where did this digest originate from?"," **Interviewee**: Oh, I'm failing to answer."
18,2022-07-25,2," **Interviewer**: Don't worry there is no wrong answer. I am simply asking and you are telling me what you know or what you think. So, there no problem saying you don't know."," **Interviewee**: I don't have knowledge regarding where it originated from. I'm not aware because the installers came through Machinga District Council. So, I just saw them coming with people from the District Council saying that they wanted to install a biogas digester here. Thus, I can't say with certainty where the installers came from and where this thing came from. It's only now that I heard the boss that it came from Egypt, I don't know."
18,2022-07-25,3," **Interviewer**: But, when they were installing the digester, you were working here?"," **Interviewee**: We just saw them coming -- and on the first day, they introduced us to them. Then, they explained how digesters work. But, they did not go into detail. It was just informal, and even the person who is in charge of maintenance of equipment here was not aware of their presence -- So, we just saw them coming, and we never really interacted with them."
18,2022-07-25,4, **Interviewer**: Um-hmm," **Interviewee**: And even when they finished we did not sit down and talk -- and that's why the digester is not functioning now. There was no problem handover. They just built it and left. So it wasn't a complete process, and with no proper handover. As a result, we just used it for a month - and we had no idea how to maintain it when it malfunctioned. The other problem was that there was no operator responsible for its operation; here at Machinga hospital we have a shortage of cooks. -- And since we were using waste matters, food leftovers and manure, we thought it was not healthy to have a person handling the waste and at the same time cooking food. But, if there was a proper hand over with the administration, I think we could have hired a casual to laborer to look after the digester."
18,2022-07-25,5," **Interviewer**: By any chance, do you know funded it?", **Interviewee**: I don't know. But people from the District Council are in a better position to answer this question.
18,2022-07-25,6, **Interviewer**: When was this built?, **Interviewee**: It was in 2021.
18,2022-07-25,7, **Interviewer**: 2021?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, early 2021"
18,2022-07-25,8, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to build?, **Interviewee**: I think 8 months
18,2022-07-25,9," **Interviewer**: You mean to put everything in place; the drums, the reactors and the equipment took 8 months?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it did not take long."
18,2022-07-25,10, **Interviewer**: Uh-hmm," **Interviewee**: But, it took longer than expected because they wanted to put an extension that could use human manure or any other manure. But, they decided that it was not health and unsuitable for a hospital context in terms of infection prevention. And, that is the reason we only used gas from the reactor that was on this, and not from the other side."
18,2022-07-25,11," **Interviewer**: So, You mean you only use reactors that use food waste and not human waste?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, yeah."
18,2022-07-25,12, **Interviewer**: What was your role as Machinga hospital?," **Interviewee**: Our obligation was to be the sole users of the digester, and I don't know if the administration played any part in regards to money contributions and all that. But, you can get that information from the council."
18,2022-07-25,13,"Do you know how you were selected as beneficiary? I mean, we have many district hospitals; we have Mangochi, Zomba etc. How did they choose this hospital?","As I said, we were only recipients. The council handled all the necessary things. So, I think the council has information regarding this matter."
18,2022-07-25,14,"Before we digester, did know anything about biogas?","No, I did not know anything about biogas."
18,2022-07-25,15,"So, it was a new and odd thing for you? I mean, you were like what is this thing....","Yeah, and we were very excited because it's easy to cook on than firewood. With firewood, you need to go to the woods and cut down trees and at the end of the day cause deforestation. Also, you need quite a lot of energy and effort to cook with firewood; you think of the work involved in cutting of wood, moving and igniting fire. While with biogas, once you switch it on you cook without issues. So, biogas is very good"
18,2022-07-25,16,"Uumh, so what were your expectations?","We expected our work to be simple and light. Because, we hoped to stop searching for wood in order to cook-- and with the prevailing blackouts, we expected to be taken out of that burden."
18,2022-07-25,17,Why did the installers tell you to expect?,"Like I said earlier on, there was no handover. If there was a proper handover, as it was supposed to be, I think we would have been clear on what is it all about. Even now, if you can go to the administrator, I\'m sure he can't tell you anything regarding this digester; He doesn't know anything about this as well. The installers were simply coming and going. And I don't know if the person from the council who was usually coming with them is still at the council. I don't see him around."
18,2022-07-25,18,How many people were coming to build this?,I cannot recall the exact number.
18,2022-07-25,19,Just an estimation...,"It's hard because I wasn't involved in the building process. I was only seeing them coming and working on it. But, I think I was seeing six or seven faces."
18,2022-07-25,20,What kind of training did you receive from the installers?,"It was one day training, but I can't really say it was one-day training; the session was only for hours. I think the training was for 2 or 3 hours, and it only focused on operation issues."
18,2022-07-25,21,"OK, what was the training like? What did they say about its operation?","As I said, we used food leftovers as feedstock. So, we take leftovers to the sorting area to sort and remove unnecessary waste. Then, we were advised to switch the machine to break down waste. From there, we were getting the crashed material, and then placed it in the inlet."
18,2022-07-25,22,"Okay, so the training was only for a day and was on the operation. Did they touch on maintenance?","During the in-service training, there was a certain person who was so much interested in the digester. He asked about feedstock preparation, I think they told him about feedstock preparation."
18,2022-07-25,23,(Laughs) you were not interested?,"(laughs) everyone was. But, he was just on another level."
18,2022-07-25,24,Is he around?,"Yes, he is. But, I doubt if he is on duty today."
18,2022-07-25,25,How many people attended the 3-hour training?, **Interviewee**: It did not last for three hours. We were about eight people
18,2022-07-25,26,"So the training was about feedstock preparation, sorting, and how to switch it on and off?",Definitely.
18,2022-07-25,27,How prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel were? Did you feel that you could operate it?,"Mmh**,** no, and we thought that we were going to have a proper training afterwards. We expected people from our maintenance department to go for training at least."
18,2022-07-25,28,Did it meet your needs?,"The time it worked, we had no problems with it. And, if we can compare that to firewood, I would say biogas is much faster."
18,2022-07-25,29,"So, instead of cooking beans for two or three hours you were taking an hour or so...","Yeah, let me show you the pots \[goes to the kitchen\]. These are the pot. That pot was for cooking nsima and that one was for side dishes."
18,2022-07-25,30,How long did it take to cook in nsima on this spot?,"We never cooked nsima on the pot because the stove was not big enough; to cook nsima on the pot, it would have been taking as at least two rounds. But, as for beans, it was only taking us an hour."
18,2022-07-25,31,"That is so quick -- impressive. Before the digester, what were you using for energy i.e. for cooking?","We were using electric cookers, and firewood in case of black out."
18,2022-07-25,32,Electricity from Escom?,Yeah
18,2022-07-25,33,Where were you getting firewood?,"We used to get wood from a place along the main road to Zomba. There is a certain place where people sell firewood along the road. Sometimes, we were buying wood from the woods; sometimes, we used to go into the villages and peoples fields to search for wood."
18,2022-07-25,34,How much wood were you using per month?,A truck of wood was costing us around K 150000.
18,2022-07-25,35,Transport inclusive?,"No, there was a separate cost for fuel and car hire. I don't know how much it was, but it was a lot -- and wood itself is expensive. I mean, one log was costing us K10000."
18,2022-07-25,36,How far is the place where you were getting wood from?,It's far - Dziwe is far distant from here.... The name of the place where people sell wood is Dziwe.
18,2022-07-25,37,Maybe 20 to 50 km from here?,I think it is around 20 km
18,2022-07-25,38,I can imagine it was involving. How did you manage your feedstock before the digester?,"We were just throwing the waste away, just like now; we were simply collecting waste into waste bins, and after some time people were transferring the waste into big rubbish bins."
18,2022-07-25,39,"After installation how did the digester work? But before that, how did it take to start after the initial feedstock?","The digester worked on the same day. And after it started, the installer told us to feed it regularly."
18,2022-07-25,40,"What did you use to start it up, and what was quantity?","Mmh, I don't know."
18,2022-07-25,41,"What were you feeding it? I don't know if I heard you correctly outside, you said you were feeding it with 20 kg of food waste and 20 liters of water per day?","Yeah, But it wasn't per day; that was simply the ratio of feedstock to water. We were feeding it with four buckets of food waste from time to time."
18,2022-07-25,42,"So, you were feeding it four buckets of feedstock and 80 liters of water a day?","Yeah, but that was at first. After it stabilized, we started feeding it with two buckets and it was working quite well."
18,2022-07-25,43,"Why did you change? Why didn\'t you maintain feeding it with 4 buckets of water? I'm mean, did you start feeling lazy?","As we continued feeding it, some of the feedstock remained intact or unused. So, we were only toping up with only two buckets."
18,2022-07-25,44,"So, the digester filled up to the required point... How did you know that it was full? I mean, how did you know that you only needed two buckets?","We were peeping through feeding chamber and we could see the feedstock. Also, we used to look at the outlet and we could see the waste was flashed out."
18,2022-07-25,45,How did you use the gas?,Only for cooking
18,2022-07-25,46,"How much gas was produced? I mean, how much cooking time did you get? Were you able to cook breakfast, lunch and supper?","We only cook porridge, side dishes and nsima at this place. Thus, on a good day, we used to cook porridge and side dishes. As for nsima, we used to cook it on electric cooker, or on firewood."
18,2022-07-25,47,How much cooking time were you getting?,"Beans were taking about 2 ½ hours. If the digester was not properly feed, beans would take up to three hours to be cooked. But, for other side dishes, I'd say it was taking us about 2 hours."
18,2022-07-25,48,How and why could you not feed appropriately? What times? What was the problem?,"We started using it in December or January, and mostly around that time, there is shortage of food. Thus, when we go into the wards around that time, we usually find little food or food leftovers. As a result, during that time, we had little food leftovers and could not feed it appropriate."
18,2022-07-25,49,"Um-hmm. So you always have a shortage of food in December and January... But, how is that even possible? I mean, this is a government hospital...","Even so, this hospital does not receive many patients and guardians bring their food too. But, most of all, December and January is a food crisis in Malawi -- food supply is scarce. So, majority of guardians who come around in December - March depend on food for the patients provided by the hospital. As a result, they do not waste or throw away food anyhow. For example, if we can go into the wards now, we will find a lot of our nsima leftovers. The patients and guardians prefer to eat food from their homes, and our food is supplementary now. Thus, around this time patients and guardians eat their own food together and a little of our food. But in January and December, you can't find food just waiting around in the wards."
18,2022-07-25,50, **Interviewer: (**Laughs) Malawi is rough; life is tough,(Laugh heavily) it is.
18,2022-07-25,51,How many patients do you serve?,This is a 300-bed facility.
18,2022-07-25,52,"You told me there was person specifically assigned to operating it. So, who was responsible for feeding it?","At that particular time, we improvised. We have ground laborers, who work at the incinerator. They burn waste two times a day, in the morning and in the evening, so they are usually unoccupied with work. So, within their free time we told them to feed the digester. Then, we tried to liaise with administration to hire a special person to operating it. But, they told us that they had challenges with the budget as there were no funds available. Then, we tried to pick one cook from the kitchen department, but it did happen as we had and still have a deficit of staff in this department. So, this was also a major hurdle in the functionality of the biogas."
18,2022-07-25,53,Did this labourer attend the training?,"Yes, he did attend the training, I think."
18,2022-07-25,54,How did you perform? Did he complain about feeding with the digester?,"That is why he withdrew from feeding it because it was a lot of work for him to work at the incinerator, and then come here to feed it."
18,2022-07-25,55,What were the maintenance requirements?,"We have our own maintenance personnel \[name redacted\]. But, as I said, everything was done through the council, so our maintenance personnel were not incorporated in this - he did not attend the training or an workshop, I don't know what to call it. So, if our maintenance supervisor was not involved, it was hard for us to repair it in case of a malfunction."
18,2022-07-25,56,How long did this thing work?,"We used it for a month. I think 2 months. And, we did not use it daily. We only used it in case of power cut."
18,2022-07-25,57,Why were you not using it full time?,"We are used to electricity, plus we did not like the idea of cooking side dish only. Like I said, the pots that were meant for the digester stove were not big enough to cook nsima on at once -- The pots were small and that is why we were using it for cooking side dishes; our big pots we use to cook nsima couldn't fit on it."
18,2022-07-25,58,What challenges did you face?,"We had a problem with an operator. Also, the machine stopped once when a cloth blocked the machine as feedstock mixed the cloth in the sorting or crashing parts; but we remove it."
18,2022-07-25,59,Who removed it?,"One cook removed it. We have a cook who is skilled in fixing electrical gadgets. So, he simply switched off, and removed the cloth."
18,2022-07-25,60,"And, it worked after?",Yeah.
18,2022-07-25,61,"Okay, how did it stop? Did it stop at once or gradually?","No, we just abandoned it. Like I said there was no person specifically assigned to this. As a result, there was no one to manage it; this happened because there was no handover. If there was a proper handover, the administration would have sourced a biogas operator. The person who we improvised was coming to me complaining about working on two jobs. Then, I would go and report the issue to the administration, but they ignored my calls because they didn't understand its dynamics, its origin as well as its outcomes -- its importance."
18,2022-07-25,62,Why do you think there was no proper handover?,"(Laughs) Eeeh, that's a big thing. The bosses know!"
18,2022-07-25,63,"(Laughs) okay - okay**.** So you said you only used it for a month and stopped because there was no operator to manage it. Do you think if there can find an operator and start feeding it, do you think it can work?","If the installers can come and assess it, and feed it after, I think it can work. But, I\'m very sure before we abandoned it, it was working."
18,2022-07-25,64,Did you communicate with the council about this?,The people from the council are aware of this.
18,2022-07-25,65,How did they know?,"I don't know how, but I'm hundred percent certain that they know that it's not working."
18,2022-07-25,66,Why do you think they didn't intervene?,"In a true sense we did not work with them, so they can\'t come or follow up on us like we worked together. And like I said, there was no proper handover."
18,2022-07-25,67,"Have you seen this, and what do you think of this information? Do you think it would have helped you?",The information is crucial because it can give clues to its operation and maintenance -- it can help people know what to do in case of a malfunction.
18,2022-07-25,68,"Okay, how would you describe the current state of this digester?",It\'s 50-50.
18,2022-07-25,69,"What do you mean, it's 50 - 50?","I mean, if the installers can come and start it again, I think it can work. I'm saying this because the digester never got broke. But I'm not sure, if it can stay for a long time unused and then work again. I'm sure the installers can know this. It's like a car -- when a car stays idle for months or years you cannot just start it. It needs a mechanic to make an assessment, apply oil in some parts and do other things are like that. Even after that you can't just get the car on the road; you sit and wait for the sound of the engine; and that's when a decision to move. So it's like that, we need someone knowledgeable to come to assess and revamp it before using it."
18,2022-07-25,70,"Clear, how did it reach this state? What caused it? Is it solely because there is no operator?",It's only that! It's as it is right now because there always no operator. I also think it's in this state because there was a shortage of food and feedstock.
18,2022-07-25,71,So you can't solely blame the handover?,Handover is important. Handover is really important.
18,2022-07-25,72,How important is it to the functionality of it?,"I'll give you an example, I'm in this office as a kitchen head, imagine if they can just bring someone from school or some office to work as a kitchen supervisor here. Where will that person start from?"
18,2022-07-25,73, **Interviewer: (**Laughs) I get you. What are you using now for cooking?,We are back to firewood and electricity.
18,2022-07-25,74,What do you do with the feedstock now the digester is not working?,"We simply dispose of waste in the waste bins. But, we don't handle and dispose of waste; we have ward attendants that do handle and manage waste. Our job is to cook and serve food."
18,2022-07-25,75,We are going to watch the end of the interview. We are remaining with five questions. Do you know how much it cost?,"No, I don't know."
18,2022-07-25,76,Do you think the hospital contributed anything in kind?,Maybe - but the administrator can give a precise answer to that.
18,2022-07-25,77,How many people were involved? You said you saw about six to seven people?,Yeah
18,2022-07-25,78,"What special items had to be imported from another country? I mean, do you think it's from Malawi? When you look at it what do you think?","No, the whole thing is not from Malawi."
18,2022-07-25,79,Why do you say that?,We import everything. Do you think we have companies that can make metal fabrications like that? I don't think so. I don't think we can make the reactors in Malawi. We don't have that capacity.
18,2022-07-25,80,Did it help you to save money the time it worked?,"It saved us money. We spend around K150000 on firewood, but around that time we did not by any firewood. We were saving, and we can save more that K150000 now since the price of everything has skyrocketed, and more so wood is expensive now because it is scarce. But, I can't say the exact amount because there was no handover. I'm saying this because the digester had a flow meter. With that, we could have managed to gauge how many kilowatts we were using a day, and correlated that to electricity charge to know the exact amount of money we were spending. It could have been important to us to know, and it could have motivated us and even the administration because we could have had a clear picture of how much firewood or electricity money we were saving."
18,2022-07-25,81,"Yeah, that's very important. What was your biggest change you notice the in your life or work the time it worked?","It is substantially reduced the workload on our cooks. Secondly, it helped us to save money -- wood is expensive. Also, it was fast to cook on."
18,2022-07-25,82,Who is responsible for sourcing wood?,"It is the cooks. The administration just hires the truck. So, usually, it two cooks who go and search firewood with the truck owners."
18,2022-07-25,83,It sounds like a lot of money and a lot of time. Don't you think it could have been better to use the money to hire an operator?,"Yeah, and that was not the only problem. In the past, we used to give out tender firewood suppliers, but we had many issues with them. They were complaining sometimes that they were going the whole year without supplying us with wood. Then, we decided to take out the tendering thing. Also, we are a government institution and it doesn\'t look good for us to do things that the government is speaking against. We cannot be doing illegal things officially. So we decided to stop making contracts and supporting individuals who cut trees carelessly. But, we still buy and use firewood when there is no electricity. And, we do have struggles with the forest department when catch our trucks full of firewood. They do seize or hold the trucks thereby leaving patients suffering. Some forest officers just let us go out of pity. But, it's always a tussle with the forest department."
18,2022-07-25,84,Do you pay fine?,No way. We are just one big family.
18,2022-07-25,85,"So, you always pass!"," **Interviewee: (**Laughs) But with struggles. We also struggled to transport firewood during the rainy season; the truck used to skid on wet dusty roads, so it took more time. An hour journey takes 3 or 4 hours."
18,2022-07-25,86,(Laughs) Tough! What is your opinion of biogas?,"Biogas is good, like I have said. The time we used it, we saved a lot of money. I would like to urge my bosses to find an operator and revamp the biogas. But before that, there must be a proper handover with the installers. I'm sure with that it can work -- This thing failed because there was no proper handover, and also because they didn't an operator."
18,2022-07-25,87,"Last question, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead of biogas?","We have used all over interventions and that is why we are using electricity. There are three cooking ways we can use, and that is; firewood, electricity and biogas; It is only sad that biogas didn't work, and that's why we are using firewood and electricity."
18,2022-07-25,88,"Thanks, any last words.",There is nothing else. Just thanks for coming.
18,2022-07-25,89,Oh great. Thanks for your time.,NA
19,2022-07-25,1," **Interviewer**: Thanks for granting us an interview. This interview is going to be short, as you have explained and demonstrated to my colleagues most of the things and have taken notes. Without further ado, where did this digester originate from?"," **Interviewee**: It was a donation from a certain NGO through the DC \[District commissioner\] office. The NGO was responsible for funding, sourcing of contractor and everything else to do with the installation of the digester. But everything was coming through the district commissioner's office. And, as Mangochi prison we did not contribute any money -- we got all the money from the DCs office."
19,2022-07-25,2," **Interviewer**: But, I would imagine you were involved in the building process i.e. digging of the digester bag. I mean, who built it?"," **Interviewee**: We did all the work that did not involve very technical skills together with the inmates. For example, we dug the hole and constructed the brick wall that you saw; the brick wall was constructed to prevent soil from collapsing into the hole of the digester bag especially during the rainy season. The inmates and I executed these two activities; I am a builder so have skills bricklaying and that is why I took part in the building process; It wasn't me who had special skills, as you know in prisons we also have people with special skills. We have electricians, carpenters, and I myself am a builder, as I have said. We decided to use local skills because we wanted to minimize the cost for its installation."
19,2022-07-25,3, **Interviewer**: How many people were involved?," **Interviewee**: I was the only warder are involved, and I worked with ten inmates; Five had skills in bricklaying and I supervised them. The other inmates were supporting us by passing mortar -- and they were the ones who essentially did most of the digging."
19,2022-07-25,4, **Interviewer**: How many people were from the construction company?," **Interviewee**: It was two; one boss and his assistant, I guess. They were the ones who connected all the fittings and pipes together."
19,2022-07-25,5, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to build?, **Interviewee**: It took about two months
19,2022-07-25,6, **Interviewer**: We have many prisons and not all the prison digesters. How were you selected as a beneficiary out of the many prisons?," **Interviewee**: They chose Mangochi prison because this district has many environmental issues -- and the digester came to enable us to minimize the cutting down of trees in the district. In an institution like this, we use a lot of wood to meet the high food demand of inmates, as a result more and more trees are cut down on a daily basis. So, the digester came to help us cook food using human manure instead of firewood -- Basically, the digester came to protect trees in this area."
19,2022-07-25,7," **Interviewer**: Okay. So I think almost if not all prisons are facing this kind of ordeal, and when you think of electrics bills, it\`s like everyone prison needs a biogas. What was the selection process? Was it a prison lottery?"," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) No, it was a gift (donation). It was something that came unexpectedly and we did not ask for it. As you know, these things tend to be expensive and not every prison in Malawi can get this, so it was just lucky. But, I think it is an ongoing thing; they started with us and I'm sure they will continue with other prisons as well. I heard there is one in Dedza too (central region)"
19,2022-07-25,8, **Interviewer**: Where did you learn this?," **Interviewee**: From my colleagues, if not it's from the installers."
19,2022-07-25,9," **Interviewer**: And yeah, there is another one in Mulanje as well."," **Interviewee**: You see, so with time, this thing will spread to other prisons -- and we are just lucky that it started here."
19,2022-07-25,10, **Interviewer**: You did mention it came from where DCs office with support from an NGO. Do you know the name of the NGO?," **Interviewee**: It\`s UNDP - everything was done by UNDP in terms of payments, hiring of the contractor."
19,2022-07-25,11, **Interviewer**: Who was the contractor?, **Interviewee**: It was \[name redacted\]
19,2022-07-25,12," **Interviewer**: Oh, \[name redacted\] from Intrinsic was the contractor."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was \[name redacted\]. He is the one who designed and planted our biogas."
19,2022-07-25,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were you expectations?"," **Interviewee**: We were excited just like anyone else would be when receiving a new donation. Even at the village level, people are always excited about new projects and developments because one expects life to change for the better. As a result, our first expectation was that the work, which we were doing in regards to searching of firewood, was going to lessen. So, we expected to protect and conserve the environment like I said earlier on. So, it was really important -- and we expected our work and life to change."
19,2022-07-25,14, **Interviewer**: Where were you getting wood?," **Interviewee**: There are so many ways of sourcing wood. First, we buy, and in certain circumstances people, who want to build a house or anything else, come and ask us to help them cut the trees, and take the wood. But, in most cases our bosses by firewood."
19,2022-07-25,15, **Interviewer**: Where do you buy wood?, **Interviewee**: They buy wood from wood suppliers.
19,2022-07-25,16," **Interviewer**: So, after everything, what were you told to expect by the installers?"," **Interviewee**: They told us that after installation, we would be able to cook food for the inmates using human waste and that was our biggest expectation. They also told us that biogas uses waste that goes through a process that converts the waste into energy through bacteria."
19,2022-07-25,17," **Interviewer**: Nice, what kind of training did you receive?"," **Interviewee**: ah, we did not receive any training. But after they finished the they explained about its operation, just like I said --and it was all basic -- like this is how you switch on and off; when the pipes leak, it's a problem, glue the pipes to stop the leakage. So, we just listened and followed what they were saying. And, it wasn't a training were you would expect person to gain skills, like any other training or learning activity."
19,2022-07-25,18," **Interviewer**: Okay, how many people were involved?", **Interviewee**: I was the only officer appointed to manage the digester as well as participate in the training or discussions; I don't know what to call it.
19,2022-07-25,19," **Interviewer**: Who else was part of training -- orientations, or briefing, I don't what to call it too?"," **Interviewee**: There were inmates who were able to run with the gas in my absence. As you know, you cannot be present at work all the times. So, we had inmates who perform cooking duties that took part in the discussions. But it wasn't training like a class session that one gains knowledge or skill. And, it was the same \[name redacted\] who went to the cooks and told them how to switch the stove on and off, and he told them that I was going to support them in its functionality and operation. Then, I taught them how to switch on and off; and in case of a pipe leakage, I told them what to do. So, I worked hand in hand with the inmates from the kitchen section throughout its life span."
19,2022-07-25,20, **Interviewer**: How many inmates?," **Interviewee**: We had inmates from the kitchen section because they are the ones that go out of the prison to source wood and other items. So, we trained them in its operation since they were the ones to interact with it on a regular basis."
19,2022-07-25,21," **Interviewer**: Approximately, how many inmates? 10 -- 20 -- 30?"," **Interviewee**: In the kitchen section, the number keeps from on changing depending on how many prisoners we have. If we have many prisoners, we choose five or seven inmates to work as cooks. And when we see that there is too much work, we add in some inmates. Then, we had a problem because some of the inmates finished their sentences, but were taught on its maintenance. As a result, the number of inmates briefed on its operation kept declining and it was daunting task to find new inmates who we could trust to work at the kitchen and brief."
19,2022-07-25,22," **Interviewer**: So, some of the inmates you initially briefed were released?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
19,2022-07-25,23," **Interviewer**: Like how many from the initial group, five or seven?", **Interviewee**: Maybe three or four.
19,2022-07-25,24,Did it affect its operation?,"No, it was just a concern. And, the things weren't complicated as you would thing."
19,2022-07-25,25," **Interviewer**: Before the intervention, what did you use for energy i.e. cooking?"," **Interviewee**: Like I've already mentioned, we used firewood."
19,2022-07-25,26," **Interviewer**: Just firewood, no electricity?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, just firewood."
19,2022-07-25,27," **Interviewer**: How much wood did you use in a month, roughly? How much did it cost you to buy firewood in a month?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, we used one ton of firewood for two or three days -- one ton truck full of firewood. And with that, we were able to cook huge amounts of beans, a big pot of nsima, and porridge in the morning for the inmates for three days."
19,2022-07-25,28, **Interviewer**: How much did one-ton truck of wood cost?," **Interviewee**: It's hard to say the actual amount because prices vary a lot depending on the season of the year; firewood becomes more expensive in the rainy season. But, like I said, it's not like we were buying firewood all the times; some of the firewood we got through donations. We only bought firewood when there was no wood in our store."
19,2022-07-25,29, **Interviewer**: How much money were you in paying in the dry season and in the wet season?," **Interviewee**: I don't know, but it wasn\'t less than K50000 for the wood only."
19,2022-07-25,30," **Interviewer**: You told me it was running on human waste and food waste. Before the intervention, what were you doing with the food waste?"," **Interviewee**: When the system was being installed, the installers considered that human waste might not be enough sometimes, so they made a provision for food waste, as the number of prisoners keeps on changing. Sometimes we do have 100 inmates, and as of now, we have 300 inmates. Thus, in a situation where the number inmates were small, we also expected feed to decrease, hence the need for extra feedstock."
19,2022-07-25,31," **Interviewer**: Okay, so before the digester, what were you doing with the feedstock or food waste? Were you just throwing away the food leftovers?"," **Interviewee**: Mostly, it's nsima, beans and vegetables, and it\'s always not that much as inmates normally finish all the food in the plate, and if there is leftover, it's only spillage -- so we were collecting just a small amount -- not enough to feed it."
19,2022-07-25,32,"So, what were you doing with the small food waste?",Just put it in the bin.
19,2022-07-25,33, **Interviewer**: How much did you start it up?," **Interviewee**: After that the digester bag was placed in the hole, we fed it with half a ton of fresh cow manure to start it up, and we add water."
19,2022-07-25,34, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the manure?," **Interviewee**: It was the responsibility of the contractor, so I don't know where he got the manure."
19,2022-07-25,35, **Interviewer**: How much water?," **Interviewee**: Of course, we did not measure the quantity of the water because we simply connected a water pump to the river, and water was going straight into the digester bag."
19,2022-07-25,36, **Interviewer**: You did have a source of water here?," **Interviewee**: We have a borehole, but it could have taken a very long time to collect water since the digester bag is huge."
19,2022-07-25,37, **Interviewer**: Where is the river?, **Interviewee**: We are not far from the Shire River. It is 150 meters away.
19,2022-07-25,38, **Interviewer**: Oh?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it is behind those buildings."
19,2022-07-25,39, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock? And how regularly were you feeding it with?," **Interviewee**: Feeding was dependent on the number of inmates. If the inmates were many, we did not add food waste even for a week. But, when we had a few inmates, the bag could not get inflated enough, so we were adding food waste to boost up the gas."
19,2022-07-25,40, **Interviewer**: What were you doing with the gas?, **Interviewee**: We used it for cooking only.
19,2022-07-25,41," **Interviewer**: How much gas was being produced? Or, how much cooking time were you getting?"," **Interviewee**: We're getting three hours of cooking time. One hour was for nsima, and two hour for porridge and side dishes."
19,2022-07-25,42, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: We had challenges with the pipes; pipes used to get punctured or damaged, and would start leaking gas. Then, we would go buy and replace the pipes to stop the gas leakages."
19,2022-07-25,43, **Interviewer**: Who was doing this?, **Interviewee**: I was doing that together with the inmates.
19,2022-07-25,44, **Interviewer**: Did you have any problems fixing the pipes?," **Interviewee**: No, the pipes were not difficult to repair."
19,2022-07-25,45, **Interviewer**: How was it like to find the pipes?, **Interviewee**: It was not difficult to find the pipes in the markets.
19,2022-07-25,46, **Interviewer**: When did the pipes start to develop issues?," **Interviewee**: The issues of pipes started after 5 or 6 months, before we had no issues with gas leakages."
19,2022-07-25,47, **Interviewer**: Did it meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: At first, it was meeting our cooking needs -- and everything was going on smoothly. Then, as time went on, it stopped meeting our needs. This started happening when the bag was the filled with human waste such that the space that was supposed to be filled with gas was filled with human waste. As you know gas is lighter than water, so when the effluent or digestate filled up the bag, the space that was supposed to be occupied by the gas was filled up with effluent or digestate. As a result, gas production started declining to a point we could not manage to cook nsima but vegetables only. Then, it stopped altogether."
19,2022-07-25,48, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: We did not have the skills to maintain it since we did not receive training; we had limited knowledge and skills to repair and maintain the digester -- and, mostly, we did not have the skills to deal with the big issues. For example, in my case, I failed to find a solution to remove the digestate from the bag - and since we did not have that skill, our digester eventually failed. Secondly, it also needed money regularly to maintain things like the pipes. Thirdly, we had a problem with the gas-pumping device, which was powered by electricity and solar. So, during power cuts, you recall how severe power outages were, it was difficult to use the pump especially when there was minimal sun to use solar power. In regards to the battery of the solar system, that was not much of a problem because we could go to the DCs office and get another battery; the battery you saw is not the one, which came with the pumping device. It's a second one, which replaced the first one. The other problem was that the inverter malfunctioned and the DC\'s office brought us another one -- so, you can see all these need money. Also, it was taking us time to replace these things, as you know; government things tend to take time as they follow long procedures."
19,2022-07-25,49, **Interviewer**: Like how much time was it taking?," **Interviewee**: Two weeks, sometimes one week."
19,2022-07-25,50," **Interviewer**: Let me ask, how did you know or figure that the declining of gas production at gas at the stove was attributed to the digester bag being filled with waste?"," **Interviewee**: We knew that because initially when we cooked and exhausted the gas in the bag, the bag was deflating to the ground level of pit, 1.5 meter under. But, after some time when all the gas was used up, the bag would not deflate to the ground level of the pit. We could note that the bag was not deflating to the ground even when it had no gas to use. -- And, that's how we realized that the digester bag was filled with digestate, because when there is no gas in the bag you expect it is deflate to ground since it cannot stand on its own-- and also when we pressed the bag we felt the pinch of human manure."
19,2022-07-25,51, **Interviewer**: How long did it work before it stopped?, **Interviewee**: It was after two years; gas production stopped after years because the bag was filled with manure.
19,2022-07-25,52," **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this? What do you think about this kind of information, and do you think it would have helped you?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, no. He gave me his number to call when we had a challenge that was beyond my capacity. For example, when the digester bag had filled up, I called him to inform him and he told me to put more water in the bag so that the slurry would become more watery, and then flush it out. Then, in the morning, I asked the inmates to put more water in the digester bags, but nothing happened."
19,2022-07-25,53, **Interviewer**: Like how much water?," **Interviewee**: 15 to 20 buckets of 20 liters. And after that, we were convinced that we had put enough water because even the outlet started overflowing with water; there was too much water at the outlet that everyone was convinced that we had put enough water, still nothing changed."
19,2022-07-25,54, **Interviewer**: What happened next?," **Interviewee**: I told him that it did not work and he said they were going to come to fix it, but they never came."
19,2022-07-25,55, **Interviewer**: Up to date?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
19,2022-07-25,56, **Interviewer**: Why do you think he did not come?," **Interviewee**: Maybe, there was no follow up plan in their agreement -- I don't know"
19,2022-07-25,57, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of the digester?," **Interviewee**: The bags are intact and good. In my mind, even though I have limited knowledge, as I was not trained in this, I think we need a truck like those, which empty pit latrines to come, and empty the bags. That way, there will be space in the bags for the gas to occupy. Then, we would also need money to buy new pipes, because most of them have stayed a long unused, and are damaged. Also, the battery needs replacing, since it has also stayed for two years without working."
19,2022-07-25,58," **Interviewer**: Now that it is not working, how do you meet your needs for energy i.e. cooking?", **Interviewee**: We have returned to cooking using firewood.
19,2022-07-25,59, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of our interview. We have done 85%. Do you know how much the reactor costs?," **Interviewee**: No, I would be a liar if I say I know how much money was involved. Like I said, it was a donation from UNDP through the district commissioners\` office. So, it\`s UNDP and the DCs that has information regarding finances, hiring of the contractor etc.; We were simply told to dig the holes for the digester bags and to build a wall, which I did as I am a builder, and that did not involve money; we did not ask for money because it was our thing. So, if you want to know about finances, like how much it cost, how much money was spent on the contractor, you need to consult the DCs office."
19,2022-07-25,60," **Interviewer**: Sure, what kind of special items had to be imported from another country?"," **Interviewee**: During installation I had a chat with the contractor and he told me he gets in the digester bags from South Africa, as for the stoves gets them from Zimbabwe - The contractor has all the information regarding where the materials came from as well as their cost."
19,2022-07-25,61, **Interviewer**: We are remaining with three questions. What was the biggest difference or changes you noted the time you had the digester?," **Interviewee**: I will say two or three things. First, it helped us to save money, which we spend on firewood as well as procuring costs. Secondly, it stopped us from cutting down trees for cooking; as a result, we were able to reduce deforestation and converse the environment."
19,2022-07-25,62," **Interviewer**: Okay, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Biogas is good a good thing; it\'s not like electricity which requires money to buy vouchers to have power. Also, you don't need application fees to have it installed. So, it is good for people who have money issues because once it is installed, you don\'t buy anything else; you only need human faeces, which are free of charge. Secondly, it's easy to operate; it's not tiresome as cooking using firewood, which requires one to blow air constantly to have strong fire. With biogas, you only need to switch it on, like an electric cooker, thereby saving time which can be used on other things."
19,2022-07-25,63, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: In my opinion, biogas is a good thing considering the fact that as a nation we are facing environmental degradation. As a country, if we can have a number of them, it would help us conserve the environment. It can also help people financially at family level especially those who use wood or electric for cooking. Since, once it is installed you don\'t need to buy anything else."
19,2022-07-25,64, **Interviewer**: Do you see it continuing?," **Interviewee**: I cannot say it will continue or not, but it will depend on how others view it. As far as, I'm concerned, I would like to see biogas continuing."
19,2022-07-25,65," **Interviewer**: You had it for nearly for three years and you wanted it to continue, but today it is dead. Do you it is possible to run it for three years?", **Interviewee**: It\'s possible. It can be maintained.
19,2022-07-25,66," **Interviewer**: You had and have the desire to keep running, and as an institution I believe you had and have resources to keep it going, but if failed. How and why?"," **Interviewee**: That\'s a good question. The problem is that I did not go to a college or to a training class to learn about biogas. So, even if money was there, but without proper training, there was nothing I could have done -- it was hard! There was a need to train me, and then I would have been liaising with the bosses to make provisions in case of failures. Everything else, we were doing that time was trial and error, and that did not help when we had a big problem. Therefore, biogas beneficiaries need to be given necessary skills, because without adequate skills there is no way a person can maintain this"
19,2022-07-25,67," **Interviewer**: So, what could have or be done to improve the skills of operators an institutional level?","I would like to see all biogas operators in institutions to go through a rigorous training. They need to know how to deal with the problems -- they need to know all the information regard maintenance of biogas such as the one you showed me. We need practical skills on that. People need to master that. We need to learn how to deal with all the problems first hand, so that when we return to our respective institutions we can solve every problem."
19,2022-07-25,68," **Interviewer**: Okay, great. Last question, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Instead of biogas, I would have liked this institution to procure electric cookers, so that we can stop relying on wood for fuel. I have also heard people using liquid petroleum gas, but I don't think it's practical here since we have big pots that we use for cooking -- it may need big cylinders, which I don't think are available on the market. Still, instead of biogas, I would have chosen LPG gas or electric cookers."
19,2022-07-25,69," **Interviewer**: In closing, is there anything you\'d like to say regarding biogas."," **Interviewee**: I just want to say thank you for coming. The time you called informing me I was in Makanjira, I'm still there. I\'m on school leave. I'm at Nansawa Technical now doing brick laying studies. But, like you said it was going to be difficult without my presence since everyone who was working here that tome is no longer here. It's far but it was worth it. you have enlightened us on some of the issues regarding biogas. It's important that you have learned about the challenges we faced, and I hope you can use them positively to come with solutions. Many thanks."
20,2022-07-26,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?, **Interviewee**: It came from ministry of energy.
20,2022-07-26,2," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay. Who designed it?"," **Interviewee**: I think it's the same people from Ministry of Energy. But, I'm not quite sure about that."
20,2022-07-26,3, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?, **Interviewee**: It was funded by UNDP.
20,2022-07-26,4, **Interviewer**: What was your role as Nankumba EPA (Extension Planning Area)?," **Interviewee**: As an office, we were trained as change agents to take the initiative to the community. So our role wasto make the people appreciate and adopt biogas technology. Around that time, a number of technologies were discussed, and promoted that time. The notable ones, the one that uses animal dung, but we also learned in theory about digester that use pit latrines. We were told this type of digester was installed at Mangochi prison. But at the end of the day, they implemented digesters that use cow manure as feedstock."
20,2022-07-26,5," **Interviewer**: I think yesterday, I was there. I saw that it. Tell me about demand; did you manage to create demand as expected?"," **Interviewee**: Aah, after seeing one beneficiary using it for two or three days, I can say there was interest from the people to own digesters. People thought that these things were admirable because it was making use of things they normally throw away for cooking. So there was interest from the people to have this type of technology in their homes, but its efficiency is what put people off."
20,2022-07-26,6, **Interviewer**: What do you mean efficiency?, **Interviewee**: Like people saw that it didn't work in other people's houses; like it wasn't producing gas as they would have liked.
20,2022-07-26,7, **Interviewer**: How were you selected as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: It's because we are responsible for overseeing energy and agriculture activities in the community, so they thought it was a good thing promote it while we had as well."
20,2022-07-26,8," **Interviewer**: Apart from that, is there anything else you think why you were selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: The other important thing was that we had the potential to run it. First, we had and we still have a cow house within. Secondly, all of our stuff which where there around that time were trained in biogas. As a result, it's operation and maintenance was easy because most of the people had the technical know how of what it all was about."
20,2022-07-26,9, **Interviewer**: How many cows did you have the time?, **Interviewee**: By then we had nine cows.
20,2022-07-26,10, **Interviewer**: I can only see one (laughs), **Interviewee**: (Laughs) they have gone for grazing.
20,2022-07-26,11," **Interviewer**: So when the installers and the people from ministry of energy came, what did they tell you to expect from this?"," **Interviewee**: Our biggest expectation was concentrated on the end result. We expected that if the digesters worked, then we would protect and maintain trees within the community, which are being cut carelessly to meet energy needs. So our vision was to make people usethis type of renewable source of energy, rather than cut down trees. And you know it takes a very long time for a tree to regenerate, so trees are special and must be taken care of whatever the cost. They also told us that the technology is kind of sustainable because people and even cows always produce manure, so it will always be around. So, we anticipated people to use digestate for purposes of fertilizer. Therefore, the technology was expected to help people in cooking as well farming by simply taking the digestate to their farms. Thus, you can see that we had high expectations,"
20,2022-07-26,12, **Interviewer**: What was UNDP's expectation? I imagine they had the same vision.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I think to them it was about saving the environment."
20,2022-07-26,13, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: Of course, we had training as extension workers. I think 75% of extension workers were trained. But, as for the beneficiaries, I don't think or remember them receiving any training. If they received, I don't think I participated in the training."
20,2022-07-26,14, **Interviewer**: Tell me about the training itself? What was it about? Like how many people were there? What did you do? What did they say and all that?," **Interviewee**: eeh, the training itself was participated by agriculture extension workers together with other stakeholders such as community development assistants (CDAs), Health surveillance assistants, and if I'm not mistaken, teachers were there as well. The training was conducted here at Nankumba EPA. We had people from Mbwadzulu EPA who came to take part in the training. The training itself took a week, 5 days. The training was both theory and practical. During the training, we also learned about solar installation, and at the end of the training, we installed one solar panel within the community."
20,2022-07-26,15, **Interviewer**: Is the solar system working?, **Interviewee**: No.
20,2022-07-26,16, **Interviewer**: Why? What happened?," **Interviewee**: You know it's a challenge to use and maintain development aid things in Africa. There were some disagreements within the school management committee. Some members wanted to use the solar system for charging phones to generate revenue. Some did not want that. So, when the solar system battery failed, they failed to replace it. Of course, schools get funds from the government but there is no provision for procuring of electrical services or products and the like. So at the end of day, it failed. I was part of the group, and I was following up everything that was happening regarding the solar system, but then it started get to my nerve so I just stopped following the whole thing."
20,2022-07-26,17," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, why does development aid fail in Malawi or Africa? For example, we are now here talking about two failures; one is regarding the solar system and the other concerning biogas digesters, why does it fail?"," **Interviewee**: Some work, some don\'t depending on how it was introduced or initiated. If you give a person something that he did not want or envision to have, it\'s hard for that person to maintain that thing. Whereas, if you give a person something that he or she wants, chances are high that that person is going to maintain that thing. I mean, who wants something, must know what and how to handle the thing. So, there is always a problem with top to down approaches, because it ends up giving beneficiaries things they didn't imagine having. For example, if you can give me a car today, I'm sure I would crush in an accident today, because it's not something I want in my heart. But, if I want a car and work towards that goal, I would work hard to take care of it. Thus, if the heart wants something and gets it, you are obliged to take good care of it because you think of the struggle that was involved."
20,2022-07-26,18," **Interviewer**: When it\`s your car, when you see bump, you avoid it (laughs)"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, when you see a bump you avoid it. You even wish to coming out of the car to flatten the bump (laughs)"
20,2022-07-26,19, **Interviewer**: (Right) why did you choose to have this digester here?," **Interviewee**: First, we did consider the movement of waters. As you can see, this is a high ground, so it's easy for water to travel, and to avoid water stagnation. Secondly, we considered the movement of the sun in this area. Of course, now it's cool because of the shadow, but around 2 to 3 PM, the sun is on that side, so there\'s plenty of sunlight here. Thirdly, we installed it here for security purposes. Around here, we have full time security personnel who guard the offices. As you can see also, stuff houses are in the proximity, so was hard for someone to steal the digester because people always looking here. So, that's why it was installed at this particular place."
20,2022-07-26,20, **Interviewer**: How did you use the gas?," **Interviewee**: It's main purpose was for cooking\... This place being a center of different functions, for example, sometimes we do have cooking demonstrations with farmer. So, we thought it wise that it was going to be easy to tell people that it\'s possible to cook using cow manure while they were actually seeing the whole thing. In this way, it's easier to create interest in people, and it\'s an effective way of teaching people regarding biogas. You know there are some things that are different to understand. For example, you cannot just tell a person that it's possible to cook using cow manure; you need the person to see what you are talking about. So, this being a center of the community, which hosts a lot of people through meetings, it was only wise and easy to sell the idea of biogas to them."
20,2022-07-26,21," **Interviewer**: So how did you use the gas? Was it strictly for demonstration purposes as you have mentioned? Or, you were also using it for making tea in your office and alike?"," **Interviewee**: No, it was made for cooking demonstrations and alike just like I mentioned. Also, there are certain times we receive visitors and you want to cook things fast and this was the solution."
20,2022-07-26,22," **Interviewer**: What times in particular talking? And, which visitors?"," **Interviewee**: I\`m think of office meetings... I remember one time; ACB (Anti-Corruption Bureau) came here to sensitize people on corruption. So, people do come here to do for various functions and they even cook during those functions. So, they need energy for cooking. So, instead of them using firewood, it would have been easy to tell them about biogas after using it."
20,2022-07-26,23, **Interviewer**: What do people use now for cooking during cooking demonstrations and other meetings?, **Interviewee**: It's mostly firewood and charcoal.
20,2022-07-26,24," **Interviewer**: Okay, do they buy firewood or charcoal?"," **Interviewee**: People do bring firewood and charcoal. Sometimes, they do buy. But, it all depends on the size of the function."
20,2022-07-26,25, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you use to start it up?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I have forgotten; 2016 is way far back. So, if I answer that I may give you wrong information."
20,2022-07-26,26," **Interviewer**: (laughs) yeah, it's been long. Did you ever use it for cooking i.e. for any cooking demonstration alike?"," **Interviewee**: No, our digester never worked even once. I think the digester was installed for trial and error purposes because of the way it was made. The digester bag was simply made of ordinary plastic paper and two pipes, which were connected on either side acting as an outlet and inlet. Also, the pipes were made of ordinary PVC pipes, which were joined to the plastic bags by a rubber. The basic idea was to feed the bag with feedstock to produce fire for cooking. We were told then that, in the bags, new feedstock was going to push out old feedstock, as it is heavier. And whatever was to come out was fertilizer. Unfortunately, the first digester was made of simple and basic material and didn't work. After some time, that\'s when they brought new digesters made of more durable plastic digesters bags. The digesters had also an outlet and inlet like the first ones. Nonetheless, the second digesters were only given to the people. Some worked; some didn't. But, as for us, we were not given the second digesters."
20,2022-07-26,27, **Interviewer**: Why weren't you given the second digesters?, **Interviewee**: I would be a liar to say I know reason why we were not given the second digesters.
20,2022-07-26,28, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?, **Interviewee**: Cow dung.
20,2022-07-26,29, **Interviewer**: Did you ever feed it?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
20,2022-07-26,30," **Interviewer**: For how long, and in what quantities?", **Interviewee**: We fed it when we were learning about biogas. We also fed it another time after a certain period.
20,2022-07-26,31, **Interviewer**: Uumh.," **Interviewee**: Because after the training, they came again and it was around that time that we fed again. But, it never worked out."
20,2022-07-26,32, **Interviewer**: How long after the training?, **Interviewee**: Maybe a week or two.
20,2022-07-26,33, **Interviewer**: How much did you feed it?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I have forgotten as well."
20,2022-07-26,34," **Interviewer**: Okay, who was responsible for feeding it? Was it you or you employed some people?", **Interviewee**: Everybody who received training was responsible for feeding it.
20,2022-07-26,35, **Interviewer**: How was it like? Didn't people complain about it?," **Interviewee**: No, they spent money on us in terms of training allowances, so it was time for us to pay back (laughs)"
20,2022-07-26,36," **Interviewer**: (laughs) yeah, yeah, I see. What were the maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: There were no major issues pertaining to maintenance. We were simply told to take good care of the digester bags which itself was easy because the plastic digester bags was made of two layers of plastic. In regards to repairing and fixing it, I don't remember them telling us who were responsible or anything like that. If they did, I might have missed it. This is how they constructed it \[takes phone to show pictures of the digester\]; you can see it was just a bag joined with two pipes that were tied to it."
20,2022-07-26,37, **Interviewer**: I think I need these pictures. Please send me on when you are able, **Interviewee**: Okay \[then stop to answer a phone call\]
20,2022-07-26,38," **Interviewer**: Okay, what challenges did you encounter?"," **Interviewee**: The concept of the new technology of biogas was good. But, the fact that it did not work was disheartening; the idea of cooking without firewood was a good idea, but the fact that we had to sweat and put in effort without gaining anything out of it was horrible - it was a major drawback. Also, the beneficiaries expected us to provide information and support to them in all issues regarding operation and maintenance because they saw that we had received training. But in truth, we were blank. We didn't have knowledge and information to pass to them. We did not know what to tell them or what they supposed to doing case of a break down. So, that was also a major challenge. Of course, we were trained and they reported the problems to us; but there was nothing we could have done to support them. And, it was funny that we had more challenges with our digesters than the beneficiaries themselves; so that was a major problem. Eventually, people realized that it was not viable, so some removed the materials, and some used the materials for other purposes like roofing. So that\'s how it was. Another thing is that the project implementers didn't follow up after installing the digesters. Of course, they came once and never came again. They only came this other time with equipment for making briquettes. They told us that they were going to give our office the equipment, but have not brought it and it's been years now; it was chaos, confusion. The same people come again, and they said they were coming with a project of MAREP \[Malawi Rural Electrification Programme\]... So, the major challenge was lack of follow up. Secondly, there was knowledge gap. It was big and I shouldn't make try to downplay it. There was a huge, huge knowledge gap among the beneficiaries and extension worker who were trained. I also feel there was a deficit in the approach itself. I think there was a problem with multi-sector approach that they used. I'm saying this because some of the people who were part of the training did not fully comprehend the whole concept of biogas, and cared less because they felt that it was mainly the responsibility of the agriculture extension workers. So, they pulled out and left the whole thing to one person \[to me\]."
20,2022-07-26,39," **Interviewer**: Why do you think this project failed? I mean, how did UNDP implement such a big project, and eventually fail? I'm sure the follow-ups must have been in the scope of the project. What happened?"," **Interviewee**: It's possible to fail.This was a technical project. Projects that are technical in nature are difficult to implement. The problem wasn't UNDP. There are so many projects that have failed but they are never reported, so you think things are working. But, in truth we just hear about the projects are successful and working."
20,2022-07-26,40," **Interviewer**: You said that this project was try and error. Why do you think this biogas project was in quote ""trial and error""?"," **Interviewee**: I cannot explicitly say so, because I don't have the evidence to back it up. But, I can fully say this project did not work -- it failed. Even then, regardless if it was trial and error, they should have produced a report with proper recommendations based on the findings. With this project, there was no report and there was no follow up. They did not come to explain the whole thing to us. I remember when they came they said similar projects were being implemented in districts like Nkhatabay Salima, Machinga and Mangochi. I think they were implementing this project in lakeshore areas where the temperature is high because all the districts I have mentioned are hot places. So, if it did not work here in Mangochi, do you expect it to work in Salima? What about Nkhatabay? What happened in those areas? Did they fail as we failed? I think it would have been better if they came to explain how the digesters in those areas worked. Then, we could have a picture of this innovation. But, nothing came up; even a mere report of how things were going or how things transpired here."
20,2022-07-26,41," **Interviewer**: So as an office, did you reach out do UNDP, or installers, or the Ministry of energy itself?"," **Interviewee**: We don't know the donor on the communication level. Secondly, I don\'t know whether it was a project or a programme. They didn\'t tell us much about that. I'm sure if it was a project then things would have been better, because we could have had a focal person, a coordinator. What I know is the people from Ministry of energy were running the program and are the ones who were coming. They people were just coming to do their thing and then go. It was like that all the times. But as far as I'm concerned, I cannot explicitly say if it was a project or not. Or, if it was a project or programme, who was funding it, and how much money was involved. If I say I know all that then I would be a liar because I only heard that but it wasn't official communication."
20,2022-07-26,42, **Interviewer**: Did you reach out to the people from the ministry that you failed?, **Interviewee**: They were coming so they knew that they had failed.
20,2022-07-26,43," **Interviewer**: Calling a shade a spade, why do you think caused this digester and the whole project to fail."," **Interviewee**: It's hard for me to say why this thing failed. I would be a liar to say I know why. But one major problem was that, we learnt so many things within a very short time. Like I said we had a five-day training session, but within that time frame, we learnt about biogas, solar installation, and all that. I think the training about biogas itself needed ample time to allow people to become conversant with the technology especially its maintenance. Learning about maintenance of biogas is not easy thing, and it's very involving. It needs time. The installers should have concentrated more on maintenance. So, I feel they just installed the digester for the sake of it; they made it too simple; they just wanted to fulfill their obligation of installing the digester rather than making it work. overall, I can't point out the specific causes for its failure; it\`s just complicated."
20,2022-07-26,44, **Interviewer**: How do you manage feedstock now?," **Interviewee**: Mostly, we use cow manure as fertilizer in our plots. Some of the manure is also picked by people for farming purposes."
20,2022-07-26,45, **Interviewer**: Do you sell?," **Interviewee**: No, I don't."
20,2022-07-26,46," **Interviewer**: So, if someone wants to get manure from your office, what's the procedure?"," **Interviewee**: We feel like it's a community thing. So they just need to come and ask for it. If we don\'t need it, we let them have it."
20,2022-07-26,47, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. How much did the reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: I don't know. We just saw them bringing the pipes, the bags and all the equipment. So, this is the team, which brought the things \[takes phone\]. The person in blue is \[name redacted\] from Ministry of Energy, I remember him."
20,2022-07-26,48, **Interviewer**: Did you or your organization anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: No, not even a glass of water! (Laughs)"
20,2022-07-26,49, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) how much labour was involved?, **Interviewee**: There was a lot of labour. Let me see how many people are there in this picture. More than eight people. We were many!
20,2022-07-26,50, **Interviewer**: How many came from the Installation company or ministry? And how many were you from agricultural office?," **Interviewee**: I think we were five, if not six people from the office. Two or three people came from the ministry."
20,2022-07-26,51, **Interviewer**: Who did the digging work?, **Interviewee**: It was our ground labourer. He was one; the hole was shallow.
20,2022-07-26,52, **Interviewer**: Was there any masonry work?, **Interviewee**: Oh no... I think yeah. The hole was lined with a brick wall.
20,2022-07-26,53, **Interviewer**: Who did that?, **Interviewee**: I can't remember.
20,2022-07-26,54, **Interviewer**: What kind of special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, looks like all the things are from Malawi. Looking at this plastic bag (points to the picture on the phone). It looks like from it's from Malawi. Maybe, I don't know. Maybe, they got that from another country, I don'tknow."
20,2022-07-26,55, **Interviewer**: We are remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: In general, I can say it's good. It's renewable energy. It's user friendly. It produces strong fire and it's fast; and, it\'s smoke free."
20,2022-07-26,56," **Interviewer**: Our study is basically looking at biogas failures, and I must say the failures are enormous. If I can bring the question to you, why do you think biogas digesters are failing in Malawi?"," **Interviewee**: Why? Maybe because it works well in hot weather so it's activities are affected by weather by design -- Maybe that\'s why it\'s failing. It could also be the people we think are expert are not necessarily experts. They too need and have a lot to learn about biogas. Or, maybe because people are just doing it for academy research, so once they defending their papers or dissertation they just let the whole thing go - so, that could be another issue - People are just doing it for the sake of school. Once they get a paper, or after getting a master's in renewable energy, then that's the end of it. So, that's another key issue. People are more eager and focused on getting a paper rather than making a change or on the technology itself to get tangible results on the ground. You know these days everyone can defend a project paper or dissertation, provided there is money. So we are failing because people are more focused on producing a paper instead of making this technology work and helping the people on the ground. So, I think that's the main issue. Personally, I do believe it's possible to implement biogas technology. It seems feasible, tangible and it can work... Maybe, we are doing things too fast in terms of doing things to implement these things to impress others. But, the main issue is that people are doing it to get papers, and not to help people. If you look at our project, you may even be surprised to find out that maybe some student got funding to UNDP to work on biogas, so after getting the his masters it is over."
20,2022-07-26,57," **Interviewer**: (laughs) okay, if you would have designed your waste or energy intervention, what could you have choice instead of biogas?", **Interviewee**: Including solar?
20,2022-07-26,58," **Interviewer**: Yeah, even solar!"," **Interviewee**: It's the same thing, and nothing else! But, it just needs proper input and output. As you know, input affects quality of a product or service. So, for this to work, we just need to change or correct our thinking, and the way we use our things. So biogas is good and feasible. This is to the gas people buy from market (LPG gas). So, even for people to accept and start using LPG it took time. So, biogas needs a good research to make it work and sustainable. But if we keep doing things in haste, it can't work. So, it needs a comprehensive research to make it work better. We can do this..... Imagine, a person in Likuni is making diesel fuel out of papers, so this can also be done.... But, that person needs the government through Ministry of Energy to support him. The government should look into his ideas and provide support when necessary. So, he just needs support from government to make him better. But, the problem with Malawi is it doesn't appreciate talent. We are always after papers, so if a person doesn't have papers, it's impossible to get support from the government - and that\'s why we\'re not developing as a country.... People who are educated need to go to that person and learn from him and government need to give him the equipment to realize his dream..... You know paper is everywhere, so if we can manage to get paper and use it for fuel it could be a good thing, and it's long term. It can also help many people to get jobs. But, the problem is that here in Malawi we don't supporting one another."
20,2022-07-26,59, **Interviewer**: Who is this person? I have never heard of him.," **Interviewee**: Really? Are you here in Malawi? People are doing great things here. Serious, there is a person in Lilongwe who is making diesel fuel using plastic paper. He is even challenging people that his product is good and can't break down a car. But, because we always pull each other down, you will start hearing that it's against policies and that if he continues he will damage people's cars. They will even put him in jail if he continues. But, I have heard the South African government is trying to help him; they have brought in some caterpillars to help to clear the land to open his plant. The Malawi government can't help him because he is from the ghetto. But, if it was some rich kid, you could have heard that the government that is willing to support him."
20,2022-07-26,60," **Interviewer**: Interesting. I will try to look for the story. Yeah, this is the end of the interview. Thanks for the interview, \[name redacted\]!",NA
21,2022-07-26,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: The installers came when I was at school, so I just found it here."
21,2022-07-26,2, **Interviewer**: So you can't know how many people installed it?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I can't know."
21,2022-07-26,3," **Interviewer**: You don\`t even who provided the money, and how much was involved to build it?", **Interviewee**: It's not a lot. We just contributed cow manure.
21,2022-07-26,4, **Interviewer**: How were you selected to as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: I can say it was just lucky or something, because only a few people received the digester here."
21,2022-07-26,5," **Interviewer**: I mean we have many households in this village, so how did it all happen? What made you say it was lucky?"," **Interviewee**: It\`s hard to tell, so I'll just say it was lucky."
21,2022-07-26,6, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas before it came?, **Interviewee**: No
21,2022-07-26,7," **Interviewer**: Okay, so what were your expectations when you find out that it was coming?", **Interviewee**: We expected to see change.
21,2022-07-26,8, **Interviewer**: What change?, **Interviewee**: Like we would be in a position to cook using a modern technology of cooking.
21,2022-07-26,9," **Interviewer**: Apart from that, what else?", **Interviewee**: We also expected to benefit.
21,2022-07-26,10," **Interviewer**: Okay, like how?", **Interviewee**: Like to be able to cook things fast.
21,2022-07-26,11," **Interviewer**: Okay, what did the installers told you to expect from the digester?", **Interviewee**: They told us to expect to cook our things fast especially if we were going to feed it accordingly - They said it works fast if it\'s fed appropriately.
21,2022-07-26,12," **Interviewer**: So, what was the appropriate way of feeding it to ensure that it was working fast?"," **Interviewee**: They told us to mix cow manure with water, like if it was a bucket (20 kg) of cow manure water, then water was supposed less than cow manure."
21,2022-07-26,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, what kind of training were you given by the installers?", **Interviewee**: I think they took my father to some place to learn about the digester.
21,2022-07-26,14, **Interviewer**: Where?," **Interviewee**: He was taken to one of the beneficiary who was given the digester before us to see how they were doing it. In this community, only two people were given the digester, and after they installed it here, the other beneficiary came to learn from us as well."
21,2022-07-26,15," **Interviewer**: So, it was like after installing the digester at the other person's home, you were asked to go there to learn one or two things. Moreover, after finishing installing the digester here, the other digester they were called to learn from your digester?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
21,2022-07-26,16, **Interviewer**: Were you available around that time?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I was."
21,2022-07-26,17," **Interviewer**: I would imagine that you did not go there, did you?"," **Interviewee**: No, my father only went there."
21,2022-07-26,18, **Interviewer**: What did your father tell you about that training?, **Interviewee**: He didn't tell me anything.
21,2022-07-26,19, **Interviewer**: Were you present when they were conducting the training here?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was there."
21,2022-07-26,20, **Interviewer**: So what was the training like? Tell me more about the training?," **Interviewee**: Many people came, and it was good because the installers made it clear that the digester was installed here for others to see and adopt in their home. However, that time people would to play for the digesters. So, yeah, many people from the village that came to see how it works."
21,2022-07-26,21, **Interviewer**: Like how many people came?," **Interviewee**: It was many people, probably around 20 to 30 people."
21,2022-07-26,22, **Interviewer**: What was then the training like? What happened during the session and what did they say?," **Interviewee**: It was about showing people how it works and how to manage it. So, people were shown how to feed it. They also talked about how gas is produced in the digester bag. People were shown how to turn on the gas stove, and people saw the flame on the stove."
21,2022-07-26,23," **Interviewer**: So after the training, how prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel were?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I thought I was going to be able to operate it without issues. Unfortunately, it only worked for some days and stopped."
21,2022-07-26,24," **Interviewer**: Okay will talk about what caused it tofail, how long did it take it to fail. Nevertheless, for the time being, let's talk about the training, how long did the training take?", **Interviewee**: It was for a day
21,2022-07-26,25, **Interviewer**: Like for how many hours?, **Interviewee**: It was from morning to afternoon.
21,2022-07-26,26, **Interviewer**: Like at one point you had to break for lunch break or something?," **Interviewee**: Aah, no. After the training, everyone went home."
21,2022-07-26,27, **Interviewer**: So how long was it specifically?," **Interviewee**: We started in the morning, like 9 AM and stopped before noon."
21,2022-07-26,28, **Interviewer**: So you did not ask for it or wanted it?, **Interviewee**: We did want it because we never knew it.
21,2022-07-26,29, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before this intervention?, **Interviewee**: Firewood.
21,2022-07-26,30, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the firewood?, **Interviewee**: Just searching around the woodlands. Sometimes we buy wood. Sometimes we buy charcoal.
21,2022-07-26,31, **Interviewer**: How much firewood do you buy?," **Interviewee**: We buy wood at K1000 per bundle. We use that to cook everything for a day. But, in truth, we rarely buy wood."
21,2022-07-26,32, **Interviewer**: Charcoal?, **Interviewee**: We buy probably one to three bags of charcoal a month. One bag costs around K5000 now; it was K2000 something that time.
21,2022-07-26,33, **Interviewer**: Where did you get cow manure?," **Interviewee**: At first, we had our own cows, but we sold them. So, we were getting cow manure from someone else."
21,2022-07-26,34, **Interviewer**: How many cows do you have that time?, **Interviewee**: Almost 15 cows.
21,2022-07-26,35," **Interviewer**: So, when you received the biogas you had 15 cows?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we had 15 cows."
21,2022-07-26,36, **Interviewer**: How did you manage cow manure before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: We were using manure in our farms.
21,2022-07-26,37, **Interviewer**: How were you doing all that? Where you just getting the cow manuredirectly to the farm?," **Interviewee**: We were gathering cow manure from the cow house to one place within the house to dry. After sometime, we were getting the manure to the farm."
21,2022-07-26,38," **Interviewer**: Okay,okay. How much manure were you producing?"," **Interviewee**: A lot of manure, maybe 10 bags."
21,2022-07-26,39, **Interviewer**: Within what period?, **Interviewee**: Maybe in two or three months.
21,2022-07-26,40, **Interviewer**: How do you differentiate cooking with biogas from firewood or charcoal?, **Interviewee**: The only difference is speed. Biogas is faster because it produces strong heat - It's different.
21,2022-07-26,41," **Interviewer**: Let's say we are cooking nsima for four people on biogas, how long would it take to get it all done?", **Interviewee**: 15 to 20 minutes
21,2022-07-26,42," **Interviewer**: If we were cooking the same nsima wood, how long would it take?", **Interviewee**: Maybe 30 minutes.
21,2022-07-26,43, **Interviewer**: How many were you in your family then?, **Interviewee**: Four people.
21,2022-07-26,44," **Interviewer**: Ummh, during inspection, my colleague asked you how much manure did you used to start it up, and you said you used 20 buckets of feedstock of which 10 buckets was cow manure, and the other 10 is water. How long did the digester take to start up after that?", **Interviewee**: It took two weeks.
21,2022-07-26,45," **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning? Or, how much cooking time were you able to get after those two weeks?", **Interviewee**: Were able to cook from morning to evening.
21,2022-07-26,46, **Interviewer**: Without issues?, **Interviewee**: We had issues in the afternoons but it was picking up after a short time -- and it's not as if we used it for long; we were only able to cook on it for only a few days.
21,2022-07-26,47," **Interviewer**: How many days specifically? And, what was the problem?"," **Interviewee**: When we started it up it was going off. Then, we would start it up again and it would go off again. Then, we called the extension worker who told us to keep on feeding it more and wait for some time. We did that but it never worked after that - and that was the end of it."
21,2022-07-26,48, **Interviewer**: How many people were using the gas?, **Interviewee**: It was the whole family.
21,2022-07-26,49," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were the operation requirements?", **Interviewee**: We only needed cow manure.
21,2022-07-26,50, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock? How did you make it all work?," **Interviewee**: We used to place cow manure into a bucket and add water. After that, we used to mix the contents. Then, we would pour the mixture in the digester. After that, we would get another bucket of cow dung and add water, and then mix."
21,2022-07-26,51," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay. Who was responsible for feeding it?"," **Interviewee**: It was my mother and I, and sometimes my father."
21,2022-07-26,52, **Interviewer**: How often did you feed it?, **Interviewee**: We were feeling it in the morning and late in the afternoon.
21,2022-07-26,53," **Interviewer**: Oh, like daily?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was daily. It's not as if the first 20 buckets got it full."
21,2022-07-26,54," **Interviewer**: Oh, I'm not clear on this. After you feed it with 20 buckets of feedstock, how often did you feed it after that?"," **Interviewee**: Okay, after feeding it for the first time we waited for two weeks for it to start up. After it started working, we did not feed it. It only worked for few days and after that, it completely stopped. And that's when we were told to feed it heavily and that was a week after commissioning it."
21,2022-07-26,55, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock?," **Interviewee**: They told us to feed it with 30 buckets bag of feedstock of which 15 buckets was cow dung and other 15 was water. And, during this time, we were told not to use it, and wait for it to restart."
21,2022-07-26,56, **Interviewer**: How long did it work before it stopped working?, **Interviewee**: It worked for three days.
21,2022-07-26,57," **Interviewer**: (laughs) and after those 3 days, what happened again?"," **Interviewee**: It never worked -- and that\'s why they told us to feed it week by week, and see how it was going to respond. Sadly, it never worked even after trying to feed it as we are told."
21,2022-07-26,58, **Interviewer**: And that was the end of it. It never worked again?, **Interviewee**: That was the end of it. It never worked again.
21,2022-07-26,59," **Interviewer**: Oh, how many times did you feed it after it stopped working?", **Interviewee**: We fed it four times in 4 weeks.
21,2022-07-26,60, **Interviewer**: How much did you feed it on each feeding?," **Interviewee**: We feed it with 30 buckets of feedstock each time, but it never worked after the four weeks."
21,2022-07-26,61, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?, **Interviewee**: That was the responsibility of the extension worker. We were only advised to call him whenever there was a problem.
21,2022-07-26,62, **Interviewer**: Were you training on maintenance or how to fix it?," **Interviewee**: No, that was the duty of the extension worker - he was solely responsiblefor fixing it."
21,2022-07-26,63, **Interviewer**: How many times did you call the extension worker and for which problems?, **Interviewee**: We only called him after it stopped working.
21,2022-07-26,64, **Interviewer**: How did he respond?, **Interviewee**: He came the very day. He stays around the community. He lives near the trading center.
21,2022-07-26,65, **Interviewer**: That's \[name redacted\]?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, he's \[name redacted\]."
21,2022-07-26,66," **Interviewer**: So after it stopped working, you called \[name redacted\] to come to fix it. He came and told you to feed it once every week for four weeks. And during this time, he told you not to use it?", **Interviewee**: Definitely!
21,2022-07-26,67," **Interviewer**: During the training you had with other people, the installers did not address issues regarding maintenance at all?"," **Interviewee**: No, they didn\'t talk about maintenance."
21,2022-07-26,68, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about feeding it?," **Interviewee**: It wasn\'t a problem; feeding it once in a week wasn't a problem. But, it was only tiresome to gather the manure."
21,2022-07-26,69," **Interviewer**: So, in the three days it worked, did it meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: Only the first day, yeah!"
21,2022-07-26,70, **Interviewer**: The second day?," **Interviewee**: It worked but it went off whilst cooking. Still, we were able to cook side dish of fish \[20 -- 30 minutes\]. It was only okay on the first day."
21,2022-07-26,71," **Interviewer**: Thanks, what challenges did you encounter?"," **Interviewee**: The problem was that it was on and off from the onset; it only worked on the first day. So, that was the problem."
21,2022-07-26,72, **Interviewer**: How did the problem manifest?, **Interviewee**: It stopped producing gas while cooking.
21,2022-07-26,73," **Interviewer**: How did it all stop? I mean it worked on the first day, on the second day you had issues. Take me through the three days? Describe for me those three days, day by day?"," **Interviewee**: On the first day, it worked quite okay. On the second day, it worked, stopped producing gas and then it produced gas, then it stopped. On the third day, it started working then stopped and since then it has never worked again."
21,2022-07-26,74," **Interviewer**: So after it stopped working you called \[name redacted\], who told you to feed and wait for it to pick up. Oh I see. Have you seen something like this before?", **Interviewee**: No.
21,2022-07-26,75, **Interviewer**: What do you think of this information and do you think it would have helped in your case?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it would have helped as it would because it would have given us knowledge on maintenance and most of all it that would have been our reference."
21,2022-07-26,76, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you ask him to give you something like this? Why did you bring the issues of maintenance to them?," **Interviewee**: Because the digester was in its infancy stage. After fixing the problem that killed it, we wanted to ask them to train us on maintenance, so that we could fix some of the problems on our own without needing their help. As you know, they can't always be here all the times. Sometimes they are busy, so in such times we would have been using the knowledge and skills to fix it in their absence."
21,2022-07-26,77," **Interviewer**: Okay, how would you describe the current state of your digester?"," **Interviewee**: The way I see it, it's dead."
21,2022-07-26,78, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: Because the bag is broken, the pipes and stove is scattered, but we still have desulpher bottle."
21,2022-07-26,79," **Interviewer**: I can't see any of that, why did you remove the equipment?"," **Interviewee**: After the bag deflated, it created a hole that became dangerous for the kids who likes to play within the compound. So, it was really dangerous for the kids especially in rainy season when it got filled with water. So to prevent accidents we just removed the digester bag and that\'s you don't see the bag."
21,2022-07-26,80," **Interviewer**: Okay, what do you think caused its failure?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, I can't know."
21,2022-07-26,81," **Interviewer**: Okay, what do you think?"," **Interviewee**: It's hard to know because it just stopped working. So, when it stopped we thought the feedstock was inadequate. But, when we fed it again with large amounts of feedstock, it never worked. So, it's hard to know."
21,2022-07-26,82, **Interviewer**: What makes you say that? What made you think the feedstock wasn\`t enough the first time?, **Interviewee**: It started with low pressure.
21,2022-07-26,83,"But you were told how much you were supposed to feed it. So, do you think the installers gave you wrong information?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) I don't know. But, I just feel like it was not adequate."
21,2022-07-26,84," **Interviewer**: Okay, now that it is not working, how do you meet your energy needs?", **Interviewee**: We have gone back to charcoal. We use charcoal to cook now.
21,2022-07-26,85, **Interviewer**: How do you manage feedstock now that it is not working?, **Interviewee**: We don\'t use cow manure.
21,2022-07-26,86, **Interviewer**: You told me you had 15 cows that time. Where is the cow now?, **Interviewee**: It is all gone now.
21,2022-07-26,87, **Interviewer**: How?, **Interviewee**: We had problems.
21,2022-07-26,88, **Interviewer**: (laughs) what do you mean when you say you had problems?," **Interviewee**: We had no money at some point, so we decided to sell the cows. We couldn't have suffered when we had cows. So, we got cow manure from somewhere."
21,2022-07-26,89, **Interviewer**: (laughs) I'm not clear on this. You said after commissioning it only worked for 3 days right?, **Interviewee**: True.
21,2022-07-26,90," **Interviewer**: After commissioning, you fed it four times in a space of four weeks. I presume you had cows that time. So, why were you getting cow from other people?"," **Interviewee**: After it stopped working, we got our manure from other people, because that time we had sold the cows."
21,2022-07-26,91," **Interviewer**: So, you mean you sold the cows some days prior or after the commissioning it?"," **Interviewee**: We sold the cows the time we started using it because encountered a certain problem, yeah."
21,2022-07-26,92, **Interviewer**: How many cows did you sell that time?, **Interviewee**: We should five cows at once.
21,2022-07-26,93, **Interviewer**: Then?," **Interviewee**: Then, we sold four cows."
21,2022-07-26,94, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you the nine cows?, **Interviewee**: We sold the cows in a space of a week.
21,2022-07-26,95," **Interviewer**: So you mean after they installed this, your had challenges that forced you to sell 9 cows?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
21,2022-07-26,96, **Interviewer**: Is this true?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's true. Do you think I can be lying, what for?"
21,2022-07-26,97, **Interviewer**: What problems you faced?, **Interviewee**: Some family problems.
21,2022-07-26,98, **Interviewer**: Did you consider that selling the cows was going to impact your digester?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but at that time we had no option other than sell the cows."
21,2022-07-26,99, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the cow manure?," **Interviewee**: From \[name redacted\], he lives somewhere there."
21,2022-07-26,100," **Interviewer**: Not far, 200 meter from here. Did you buy?"," **Interviewee**: No, we just gave him K10000 to have unlimited access to the cow manure; and it wasn't like he specifically asked for that. So, I don't see it as we bought him."
21,2022-07-26,101," **Interviewer**: Okay, nice. Where did you get the water for feeding this?", **Interviewee**: We got the water from a borehole
21,2022-07-26,102, **Interviewer**: How far from here?, **Interviewee**: From here to that mango tree
21,2022-07-26,103, **Interviewer**: This is roughly 500 meters. Did you contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: Everything was brought by the installers.
21,2022-07-26,104, **Interviewer**: Which organization?," **Interviewee**: I don't know the organization, like I said, I wasn't around when they brought this. I was a school that time."
21,2022-07-26,105," **Interviewer**: So, you cannot know how many people birth this?"," **Interviewee**: No, I can't no."
21,2022-07-26,106, **Interviewer**: But your dad knows?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, he knows"
21,2022-07-26,107, **Interviewer**: What is the biggest difference now that you don't have there the digester?, **Interviewee**: Things take time to cook now.
21,2022-07-26,108, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?, **Interviewee**: I think it's better if we can bring another digester if it is possible.
21,2022-07-26,109," **Interviewer**: (laughs) if another digester comes, will it not fail as the last one?"," **Interviewee**: Maybe, it can be different from that."
21,2022-07-26,110, **Interviewer**: How different?, **Interviewee**: In terms of its performance; maybe that one will work.
21,2022-07-26,111, **Interviewer**: We have three questions to finish the interview. What is the future of biogas in Malawi?, **Interviewee**: I don't see it progressing so this will make more Malawian to continue using firewood
21,2022-07-26,112, **Interviewer**: Why and what should be done to make this work?," **Interviewee**: As for us, we just need a new technology, because we don't have cows. So, it will need money for us to continue using it. Thus, many people who don't have cow can't manage it because it may need money to run."
21,2022-07-26,113," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own energy or waste intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: Aah, we know people use electricity to cook."
21,2022-07-26,114," **Interviewer**: So, you want electricity?", **Interviewee**: We would choose any technology to use for cooking which does not require electricity.
21,2022-07-26,115, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: Electricity is expensive.
21,2022-07-26,116," **Interviewer**: Okay thanks, that was my last question. Do you have anything to say?"," **Interviewee**: No, thanks."
22,2022-07-26,1, **Interviewer**: Where did this digest originated from?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, the installers said the digester was from China."
22,2022-07-26,2, **Interviewer**: Who built it?," **Interviewee**: \[name redacted\] was responsible for overseeing the installation of the digesters here in Nankumba. But, we cannot recall who else was involved because it has been a long time."
22,2022-07-26,3, **Interviewer**: How long has it been?," **Interviewee**: A lot of time has passed. It\'s been three years, if not four years. They came the first time and installed a biogas digester made of ordinary plastic digester bag which didn't last long. Then, they came a year later with a biogas digester made of very strong and durable plastic. The first digesters didn't work. Then, they came a year later with the second digester that worked, and even the bags stayed for a very long time."
22,2022-07-26,4," **Interviewer**: So in 2018, they came with the digesters made of ordinary plastic bags. Then, they came a year later and installed the digester that we have found?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and they even brought a different stove; the first time they brought a stove made of clay that did not work."
22,2022-07-26,5," **Interviewer**: So, when they came the second time, what was your interaction with them like?"," **Interviewee**: They admitted that the first ones didn't work, and assured us that the new digester was going to work. And, we did really see a difference because we were able to use for some days, and even some months."
22,2022-07-26,6, **Interviewer**: The first ones?, **Interviewee**: We first once didn't work at all. It never produced fire.
22,2022-07-26,7, **Interviewer**: You mean after they installed the first ones you did not even use it for a day?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, not even a second. I didn't even see fire. But, the second digester worked and people were able to come and see it working; many people came including all my neighbors."
22,2022-07-26,8, **Interviewer**: How many people built this one? It was \[name redacted\] and how many other people?," **Interviewee**: It was four; \[name redacted\], a white man, and two other black people, of which one was female."
22,2022-07-26,9," **Interviewer**: When was this, 2018?", **Interviewee**: I believe it was 2018.
22,2022-07-26,10, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to build the digester?," **Interviewee**: First, they gave us dimensions and told us to dig a hole according to the dimensions. After some days, they came to install with the digester. The installation took about an hour, and we also took about one hour to prepare the first to feedstock."
22,2022-07-26,11, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to dig the hole and how many were you?," **Interviewee**: It was two, and it took us a day or two. Initially, they drew a circle on the ground where we were supposed to dig the hole. They told us to dig a hole 1.5 meters deep. The diameter was two meters. The hole we made for the first one was different from the second one; the first hole was very shallow and long."
22,2022-07-26,12," **Interviewer**: Okay, what was you role?"," **Interviewee**: To dig the hole, and to feed it with cow manure and water."
22,2022-07-26,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, we will talk about the feedstock and water at length later. But for the time being let us talk about how you were selected to be a beneficiary. I mean, in this village there are many households, over 100, how were you chosen as beneficiary?", **Interviewee**: (Stays quiet) Laughs
22,2022-07-26,14, **Interviewer**: Is it clear?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it is clear (laughs) \[let me come and help\]"
22,2022-07-26,15," **Interviewer**: Come - we have many households in this community, even more than 300, so how were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: They selected us because we possess certain skills, so they thought we could manage it better."
22,2022-07-26,16," **Interviewer**: Ooh, what skills do you have? We have many skills, so what kind of skills do you possess?"," **Interviewee**: Before giving out these things, they look at all individuals in the community, so they looked at us and felt that we could manage the digester. Maybe, they looked what we had which others didn't have."
22,2022-07-26,17," **Interviewer**: Okay, so which things do you think made you stand out?"," **Interviewee**: I think it is because to run a digester you need a cow house, and they saw that we had cows, so thought they could operate with ease."
22,2022-07-26,18," **Interviewer**: Oh, okay. How many cows did you had that time?"," **Interviewee**: I believe we had three adult cows and two young ones. In total, I can say we had five cows."
22,2022-07-26,19," **Interviewer**: By the way, when you say \[name redacted\], do you mean the extension worker from agriculture?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
22,2022-07-26,20," **Interviewer**: How did the approached you? Or, how did you learn that you were going to benefit?"," **Interviewee**: He just came here and told us that people were going to come and install a digester here, and he asked us if we could be interested and I told him that I was interested. Then, after a week or so, came and asked us to find cow manure. At the beginning, we did not have enough cow manure, so we went to ask from other people, as we had to attain a certain amount of manure to start it up."
22,2022-07-26,21," **Interviewer**: Before \[name redacted\] and his team came, did you know anything about biogas?"," **Interviewee**: No, no."
22,2022-07-26,22," **Interviewer**: So, what were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: We expected people to come, learn and adopt this type of cooking in their homes. We expected to cook with ease, and without using firewood. In addition, we expected to conserve the environment as we anticipated cooking without firewood, but cow manure."
22,2022-07-26,23, **Interviewer**: What did \[name redacted\] and his team told you to expect from this?, **Interviewee**: They basically said we would be using the digester for cooking.
22,2022-07-26,24," **Interviewer**: Apart from that, what else were you told to expect from this?"," **Interviewee**: They told us a few things, but we are humans and it has been a long time, so we have forgotten some of the things. I think they told us that the digester was going to be producing digestate that could be used as fertilizer."
22,2022-07-26,25," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you use the digestate as fertilizer?", **Interviewee**: No.
22,2022-07-26,26, **Interviewer**: Why not?," **Interviewee**: We did not manage to collect the cow manure from the first digester bag because there was no proper setup; the manure (digestate) just spilled over to the ground. In regards to the second digester, they told us about the digestate. But, we expected them to do follow ups and tell us how to know that the digestate was ready, how to collect the digestate, because we did not know how to handle it. Sadly, before they for follow up the rains started, so we removed the bag from the ground so that it could not be rotten and eaten."
22,2022-07-26,27, **Interviewer**: \[no question\]," **Interviewee#2**: I can say the installers had no interest in this project because once the digester was installed it, they never came to see what was happening. We told them about the issues and they never came, so we thought the bag and project was done. Because our assumption was that once we reported a problem, they would be coming to rectify the issues. However, no matter how we tried to report, they just never came - and out of all the digesters that were installed around this community only this one worked, and we had people coming to see it."
22,2022-07-26,28," **Interviewer**: So, out of all the digesters that were installed in area this one outlived the rest?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
22,2022-07-26,29," **Interviewer**: Oh, how long did it work before it stopped?"," **Interviewee**: Close to a year; and the person you first made your visit \[name redacted\], is the one whose digester failed first."
22,2022-07-26,30," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you receive training?"," **Interviewee**: No, we did not."
22,2022-07-26,31," **Interviewer**: If you did not receive training, then how were you able to operate it, or switch it on and off?"," **Interviewee**: We only received simple instructions. For example, they told us how to switch it on; like this is what you do when you want to increase the intensity of the fire; and, if you are cooking with a big pot this is what you do."
22,2022-07-26,32, **Interviewer**: What did they say about cooking with big pots?, **Interviewee**: They showed us the volume control knob and told us to put it on full blast when cooking food in a big part.
22,2022-07-26,33," **Interviewer**: Oh, okay. Did they tell you anything about maintenance?", **Interviewee**: Not really. They only told us to remove soil when it falls into the pit to prevent the bag from getting damaged. We were then asked to build a brick wall around the digester bag to prevent soil from collapsing into the pit.
22,2022-07-26,34," **Interviewer**: OK, did you?"," **Interviewee**: No, we didn\`t have the resources."
22,2022-07-26,35," **Interviewer**: Okay, what else?"," **Interviewee**: They also told us to be extremely careful with the connection at the top of the bag \[gas connector\], where the bag and pipes links, because it is very delicate, and that once it broke we would not be able to get fire."
22,2022-07-26,36, **Interviewer**: How were you supposed to manage that part \[gas connector\]?," **Interviewee**: When the gas connector was bent, we were required to straighten it up; when the bag was deflated, we had to keep the joint straight; when the bag was full, we had to keep it straight as well me."
22,2022-07-26,37," **Interviewer**: How long did so-called training take? And, how many of you were involved?"," **Interviewee**: We were three: wife, my son and me. And they told us all this when they were installing it."
22,2022-07-26,38," **Interviewer**: So it was three of you, just like you are now -- and they simply told you how to switch it on; that you would need to take care of your joint at the top of the bag; and that you should ensure that soil did not fall into the pit...", **Interviewee**: Yeah
22,2022-07-26,39, **Interviewer**: What else apart from that?, **Interviewee**: That was all
22,2022-07-26,40, **Interviewer**: Did you feel you were prepared to operate it?," **Interviewee**: Since it was our first time to see and use it, we simply accepted and acknowledged what they told us. We did not feel or know if the information was wrong or inadequate - We trusted them. They were like our teachers -- and you do not doubt or question your teacher - and that is why when it failed, we reached out to them, as our teachers, to help us solve the problem."
22,2022-07-26,41," **Interviewer**: So, you basically trusted them and felt the information you received okay and that you could operate it?", **Interviewee** Yeah
22,2022-07-26,42," **Interviewer**: Why did you build the digester here? I mean, when they came you could have just said thank you, but I don\'t need it. Why did you accept the digester?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but we were convinced by their explanation in regards to meeting our cooking needs. So, we thought that once we had it, we would no longer search for firewood to cook."
22,2022-07-26,43, **Interviewer**: Where do you get wood?, **Interviewee**: From those mountains \[points to mountains from far distant\]
22,2022-07-26,44," **Interviewer**: Eh, that is far"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we go there in the morning around 6 AM and we return around 12 or 2 PM."
22,2022-07-26,45," **Interviewer**: Do you buy for firewood there? Or, you just get it free?", **Interviewee**: We do not buy.
22,2022-07-26,46," **Interviewer**: So, before the digester came you were just using firewood."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we go to the mountains to source firewood. When we have firewood, we don't go there - Once we have run out of firewood, we go there to find firewood. So, yeah, the mountain is our only source of firewood."
22,2022-07-26,47," **Interviewer**: Okay, how much firewood do you get from the mountains? Or, how often do you go there?"," **Interviewee**: We do get a lot of firewood from the mountains, usually enough for a week. It's far but we still go there; when we go there, we stop and rest for three or four times - we even get sick upon returning."
22,2022-07-26,48, **Interviewer**: You told me that one of the reasons they chose you to be a beneficiary is because you had cows and that sounds like a valid reason; it does not make sense giving a digester to a person who does not have cows. What were you doing with cow manure before the digester?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we used to use it as fertilizer; we keep cow manure and use it later as fertilizer in our farms."
22,2022-07-26,49, **Interviewer**: I have not seen any cow around. Do you still have cows?,"Yeah, we have two now."
22,2022-07-26,50, **Interviewer**: What happened to the rest?, **Interviewee** We sold them.
22,2022-07-26,51, **Interviewer**: Do you differentiate food cooked on biogas from food cooked on firewood?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it does"
22,2022-07-26,52," **Interviewer**: Oh, it does, how?"," **Interviewee**: The food cooked on firewood taste like enough heat did not go through it when you compare it to food cooked on biogas. Thus, food cooked on biogas feels like it\`s sufficiently cooked because enough heat goes into the food. In addition, pots tend to get black with soot when food is cooked on firewood. But, it stays clean after cooking on biogas."
22,2022-07-26,53," **Interviewer**: Okay, the way I understand the biogas, before you start using it, you need to feed it with huge amount of manure and water, then you proceed feeding it continuously, but with less feedstock. How much feedstock did you start with?"," **Interviewee**: It was a lot of cow manure; we started with 3 bags of cow manure, and I remember clearly, we added 10 buckets (20 liters) of water.... We filled it with one drum of water (200 liters). Then, we were told to feed it with three buckets (20 liters) of manure again, if it did not get inflated. So, after we saw that the bag was not getting inflated, we added 3 buckets. And as we were told the first time, we covered the outlet and inlet. I have also remembered that they told us that the digester flushes out digestate when it is full and they advised to use it as fertilizer."
22,2022-07-26,54, **Interviewer**: Did you get the digestate?," **Interviewee**: It only happened once. One day, it got full with pressure and flushed out the digestate. But, it was not as much, and it was not as much as they said it produces, so we did collect and use it as manure -- it only flushed out once after it filled with pressure."
22,2022-07-26,55, **Interviewer**: How was the outlet like?," **Interviewee**: We dug a small round hole for collection of digestate at the outlet pipe. And, we used to wrap and cover both the outlet and inlet pipe with a plastic sheet. So, when it flashed out digestate it took out the plastic sheet at the outlet."
22,2022-07-26,56, **Interviewer**: Why did you cover the inlet and outlet pipe?, **Interviewee**: We used to cover it to enable gas to build up in the digester bag.
22,2022-07-26,57, **Interviewer**: Did you ever use the digestate?," **Interviewee**: No, because it only flushed out once."
22,2022-07-26,58, **Interviewer**: Did you get liquid things at the outlet?," **Interviewee**: No, we never did."
22,2022-07-26,59, **Interviewer**: So you started it up with 3 bags of manure and the 200 liters of water.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, three bags of 50 kgs."
22,2022-07-26,60, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water and manure?," **Interviewee**: We got fresh manure from people's cow houses around village and some manure we got from our cow house; and after gathering all the manure, we mixed the manure with water in a bucket."
22,2022-07-26,61, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?, **Interviewee**: We mixed the whole thing in a bucket using our own hands.
22,2022-07-26,62," **Interviewer**: Iih, why didn't you use a wooden stir, a stick or something?"," **Interviewee**: They told us not to use that because it does not break the manure as required -- and to remove trash from feedstock, you need hands as well (Laughs heavily). Some people said they would not do that -- Imagine going to be people's houses to collect fresh cow manure - it was gross -- and they made it perfect clear that we should use manure that had not stayed for more than a day. But, for the first digester we used dry manure, so that was better (Laughs)"
22,2022-07-26,63," **Interviewer**: (laughs) that was gross. So, with the first digester, did you feed the same three bags of manure and water to start it new up?"," **Interviewee**: No, it was a small bag."
22,2022-07-26,64, **Interviewer**: How many bags?, **Interviewee**: 2 buckets.
22,2022-07-26,65, **Interviewer**: Water?, **Interviewee**: Maybe 5 buckets (20 liters)
22,2022-07-26,66, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up?," **Interviewee**: That one never worked. The digester did not show anything. It was only producing a hissing sound, and when we tried to light it up with matchstick, it was only giving a very quick but low sparkling or snapping sound."
22,2022-07-26,67, **Interviewer**: Were the installers there?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they were there, and for three days, it was giving a very low snapping sound -- but after three days, it stopped completely. We went to the agriculture office to report, but they never came - the problem was that when we reported a problem, they never showed up - and it is not as if we were calling them on the phone, but we used to go there in person to meeting \[name redacted\] and he never came. The installers even gave us their cell numbers, but they said we should report to \[name redacted\] to come and fix."
22,2022-07-26,68, **Interviewer**: Oh (laughs)," **Interviewee**: (laughs) you see, he never showed up."
22,2022-07-26,69, **Interviewer**: What was he saying you go there?, **Interviewee**: He was just saying that he would find time to come but he never did.
22,2022-07-26,70," **Interviewer**: Okay, so next time you saw him was when he came to change in the bags?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, he came to explain that he was coming with me new digesters. After that, he came to install it, but after since then he has never showed - \[name redacted\] has never come since then. When we reported to him, he never came."
22,2022-07-26,71," **Interviewer**: Oh, okay. Talking of the second digester, you said you used 3 bags of fresh cow manure and 200 liters of water. How long did it take to start up?"," **Interviewee**: It took time to start up the as the sun was not shining as it is now then. But, after two weeks, the bag got full. Then, they came with a stove and pipes, connected everything together, and it worked. As for our friends, their digester bags got full, but when they tried to start the gas, they did not produce gas. As for ours, once it was installed, it produced very strong fire."
22,2022-07-26,72, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to stop?," **Interviewee**: We used it for a year - close to a year. And, when it stopped we reported to \[name redacted\]."
22,2022-07-26,73," **Interviewer**: How much gas did it produce? Or, how much cooking time did you get?", **Interviewee**: We were able to cook nsima and beans and even boil water (2 hours).
22,2022-07-26,74, **Interviewer**: Without any problems?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
22,2022-07-26,75, **Interviewer**: For almost year?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
22,2022-07-26,76, **Interviewer**: How often were you feeding it?," **Interviewee**: They advised us to feed it daily. So, every morning we used to mix cow manure and water, and feed it in the bag -- Everyday. However, we were feeding it according to the cow dung we had -- 2 buckets every day"
22,2022-07-26,77," **Interviewer**: Usually, you were feeding it with 2 buckets. Still, it was dependent on the cow manure you had collected on a particular day; it was not as if you were feeding it a certain amount of manure every day. It was not as if you were feeding it with two buckets of manure. Take me flew that one?"," **Interviewee**: It was mostly two buckets; sometimes, just a bucket. But, they told not to miss a day. So, when we fed in the morning, we were able to cook around this time \[11 AM\] without issues."
22,2022-07-26,78, **Interviewer**: Where were you getting feedstock? How did you manage to fitted?," **Interviewee**: For this one we were able to use cow manure from our cow house. But for the first feedstock, we had to ask other people because we needed a lot once. In addition, we even hired people to help us draw water during the first feed."
22,2022-07-26,79, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water to start up?," **Interviewee**: I do not know if we used water from the well or borehole -- But, I believe it was water from a borehole; and they said we shouldn't use salty waters."
22,2022-07-26,80, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: Because it damages the bag.
22,2022-07-26,81, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you use the public tap behind the house?, **Interviewee**: It was not installed at that time. It has only been planted this year.
22,2022-07-26,82," **Interviewer**: Oh, where is the borehole?", **Interviewee**: It there (points)
22,2022-07-26,83, **Interviewer**: That was like 400 meters. How did you use the gas? Was it only for cooking?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was only for cooking"
22,2022-07-26,84, **Interviewer**: You didn't use it for lighting?, **Interviewee**: No.
22,2022-07-26,85, **Interviewer**: Did they explain that is possible to use biogas for lighting?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they explained that it could be used for lighting"
22,2022-07-26,86, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you ask you for that?," **Interviewee**: They explained that if it worked, they were going to install lights. And, that's how we knew that biogas can also be used for lighting. So, we expect them to come one day so that we could use it for lighting; so we waited and waited but they never came."
22,2022-07-26,87, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements? Did you only require water and cow dung?," **Interviewee**: They did not talk about pig manure. They only talked about chicken and goat manure, and they said we only needed to break the manure thoroughly. In addition, they advised us to make sure that there was not trash in the feedstock to prevent blockages and damages."
22,2022-07-26,88, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding?, **Interviewee**: Only me
22,2022-07-26,89," **Interviewer**: Father, you were not helping her? (Laugh) Why?"," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) she cooks, so it was one."
22,2022-07-26,90," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did you feel about feeding it? Was it not gross or tough?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we did not feel bad or gross about it; the digester was here to help us with cooking. So we had to feed it, and we couldn't have done otherwise."
22,2022-07-26,91, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: We were not told about maintenance. Maybe, if they had come when we reported, they could have told us in how to maintain some of the issues. They only told us how to switch it on, and how to take care of it as I have explained."
22,2022-07-26,92, **Interviewer**: Like trash should not be in feedstock because it blocks with the digester and not use salty water...," **Interviewee**: Yeah, yeah"
22,2022-07-26,93," **Interviewer**: If it broke down, what was supposed to happen?"," **Interviewee**: They told us to inform \[name redacted\], and then \[name redacted\] would do inform them."
22,2022-07-26,94," **Interviewer**: Okay, did it meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah it was not bad and we were happy with it. People used to come here to admire it. And, most of them were saying if it was going to last for a year or so. They were going to adopt the technology in their homes."
22,2022-07-26,95," **Interviewer**: You said it wasn't bad, which makes me think you were not fully satisfied with it"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) at first it used to meet all needs, but after some time it started misbehaving."
22,2022-07-26,96," **Interviewer**: At first it was working, were you using firewood for cooking?"," **Interviewee**: No, we were not."
22,2022-07-26,97, **Interviewer**: Zero?, **Interviewee**: Yeah (Laughs)
22,2022-07-26,98, **Interviewer**: She's laughing -- is she being truthful?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) at first we had no issues, But after some time it was not as effective; you could leave it working, but after going for a very few minutes you would find it off. So, it was like we were starting cooking on biogas, and finished cooking on firewood."
22,2022-07-26,99, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start having these issues?, **Interviewee**: It took a fair amount of time; it took some time. It worked for seven months and we started facing the issues maybe in the fifth or sixth month.
22,2022-07-26,100," **Interviewer**: OK, you have talked about various problems. I mean, we have discussed many issues. Specifically, what were the challenges?"," **Interviewee**: As I have said, we worked hard to feed it, and you have understood that we did put a lot of effort and commitment on this. But, I feel like we didn't get its full value, as it was not durable enough; it was not stable and reliable -- it's not dependable. We did put a lot of effort on it, but it did not last long enough."
22,2022-07-26,101, **Interviewer**: Then main issue is that it started producing little gas after 5 - 7 months. How did this problem manifest? What did you see apart from the fact it was producing little gas and eventually stopped?," **Interviewee**: The bag was deflating fast, and was only inflating when there was too much sun light; without the sun, it was deflating. Thus, even when the bag was full, we were not using it for a long time as at the beginning. At first when it was inflated, we could use it even during the evening because it was containing a lot of gas."
22,2022-07-26,102, **Interviewer**: Was the bag punctured?, **Interviewee**: It looked as if there was a puncture underneath at the connection.
22,2022-07-26,103, **Interviewer**: Where? Not at the gas connector?, **Interviewee**: Yeah! Not at the gas connector.
22,2022-07-26,104," **Interviewer**: Oh, there was also another connection?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, there was also a connection between the bag and the outlet pipe. There was a leak around that connection, just before here the rubber strips were rolled. It looked like there was a leak because when we were feeding it, we could see water leaking and it was even producing bubbles when gas was escaping from the bag... However, before this we had another leakage too."
22,2022-07-26,105," **Interviewer**: Uumh, okay what did you do when you saw that gas is leaking?"," **Interviewee**: We reported the issue to \[name redacted\], because at that time the bag was filled, so it was difficult for us to take out the bag from the pit. The bag was heavy that people could to lift it out of the pit. Imagine how much the bag would weigh after being fed with manure daily for 7 months. It was heavy for us to bring it out. We need there skills to take the bag out and fixed that connection."
22,2022-07-26,106, **Interviewer**: You said you had another leakage before this take me through that one.," **Interviewee**: We also had a gas leakage at the gas connection a month or two prior to this. It happened when the bag was very full that it caused the gas connector to separate. After this, we bought super glue, and then glued the connection and gas never leaked on that part again. However, the real problem was the leakage that happened at the connection between the bag and outlet pipe."
22,2022-07-26,107," **Interviewer**: How did you figure out it was leaking gas? Moreover, how did you figure to solve the problem?"," **Interviewee**: It was producing gas bubbles just like the second issues, and when we checked the gas connection, we saw that a patch had detached from the bag. So, that\`s when we bough super glue and glued the patch to the bag."
22,2022-07-26,108, **Interviewer**: When did this happened?, **Interviewee**: Maybe 3 or 4 months after it was installed.
22,2022-07-26,109," **Interviewer**: Okay, Have you seen something like this? \[Intervention sheet\]", **Interviewee**: No.
22,2022-07-26,110," **Interviewer**: What do you think of this kind of information, and do you think it could have helped you?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, it would have helped us see to find the solutions on various issues. In addition, we would not have been reporting everything. We could have been reporting issues after failing to deal with them ourselves first."
22,2022-07-26,111, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of your digester?, **Interviewee**: It is dead; it malfunctioned and it is now finished.
22,2022-07-26,112, **Interviewer**: Do you think it can be revamped?, **Interviewee**: You have given us some kind of hope that we may use it again.
22,2022-07-26,113, **Interviewer**: How?," **Interviewee**: This one cannot work again. It is finished; some of the items are lost, and some of the items are completely damaged, for example, the digester bag."
22,2022-07-26,114, **Interviewer**: In your opinion what caused it to fail? What went wrong?," **Interviewee**: In my opinion, the problem was initially minor, but the fact is that we reported to them and they did not come to solve the problem, made the problem worse. I also feel it failed because we did not receive training, so when that issue arose we could not solve"
22,2022-07-26,115," **Interviewer**: What do you think, father? What went wrong?"," **Interviewee**: It is the same issues. Without the installers, we could have done nothing to solve the problem. Had it been the problem was at gas connection, we could have solved ourselves... So, when it leaked the first time, we reported the issue, but they did not come. Therefore, we took the mother in our own hands; we simply used sand paper to rub the two surfaces and glued them with super glue. And, when the bag got inflated, it did not leak anymore. Nevertheless, the leakage that occurred at the connection between the bag and outlet pipe, was too big for us and that is why it kept on deflating when it got gas, and eventually failed. We tried to report it, but they did not come. One time, I met him just along the main road, he just said he was in going to come but he never did. Then, we just decided to abandon it."
22,2022-07-26,116," **Interviewer**: Now that is not working, what are you using for cooking? Are you back to using firewood?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
22,2022-07-26,117, **Interviewer**: Charcoal," **Interviewee**: It is tough to source money for charcoal. However, sometimes when we have money we do by charcoal."
22,2022-07-26,118, **Interviewer**: How often do you buy charcoal?, **Interviewee**: We do not really use charcoal it is expensive; we rarely use charcoal.
22,2022-07-26,119," **Interviewer**: OK now that is not working, what do you do with the feedstock?", **Interviewee**: We take the manure to the farm as fertilizer.
22,2022-07-26,120, **Interviewer**: How many bags of manure do you make from your two cows in a month?, **Interviewee**: We make three bags of dry manure
22,2022-07-26,121, **Interviewer**: Which crops do you use it on?, **Interviewee**: It is only for the maze.
22,2022-07-26,122, **Interviewer**: Do you know how much the digester cost?," **Interviewee**: No, they just said it's expensive."
22,2022-07-26,123, **Interviewer**: Do you know who paid for it?," **Interviewee**: They said it was a donation from white people; we do not know where the white men are from though. In addition, one of them came too."
22,2022-07-26,124, **Interviewer**: What was his reaction together with the other installers?," **Interviewee**: We told them about the first digester and they knew you the problem. They said agreed that the first digester was not good and the plastic bag was not up to standard. And, that was why they brought the second digester. So, I talked with them just like we're talking now; the white man wasn\'t involved in the conversation. Therefore, we do not know if they told him about the first digester."
22,2022-07-26,125, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything?, **Interviewee**: Nothing
22,2022-07-26,126," **Interviewer**: How many did you hire, and how much did you pay them?"," **Interviewee**: For the first day digester, I did not hire people because the bag was small. But the second digester I had four people which I paid them K8000 for drawing water."
22,2022-07-26,127, **Interviewer**: Digging?," **Interviewee**: I did the digging. It took me a day or two. Initially I was told to dig a hole, but when they came they said it was not a good one. So, they asked me to dig another one at a different place."
22,2022-07-26,128, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) what was the problem?, **Interviewee**: (laughs) they said the hole wasn\'t round.
22,2022-07-26,129, **Interviewer**: (laughs) how did you feel?," **Interviewee**: It was OK, you know the expectation and excitement of owning something that people do not have, but wish to have. You are willing to go all the way."
22,2022-07-26,130, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?, **Interviewee**: I think it's not from Malawi. I have only forgotten but they said it is not from Malawi... They said it is from China - They bought it if from China. I think they said something like that.
22,2022-07-26,131, **Interviewer**: You said you were covering the outlet and inlet pipes what were you covering it with?, **Interviewee**: There were two pieces of plastic made of the same material as the digester bag. We just put them on top of the pipes and wrap with rubber strips in order to allow the digester to produce gas.
22,2022-07-26,132, **Interviewer**: You said you do not buy firewood. Do you think you saved money the time it worked in any way?," **Interviewee**: No, since we do not buy firewood."
22,2022-07-26,133, **Interviewer**: What was the biggest difference in your life the time it worked?, **Interviewee**: It was a joy to have; many people were coming to see is the digester; it was as if we had an electric cooker.
22,2022-07-26,134," **Interviewer**: We are remaining with two questions, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: It's good, but I have a problem with because it didn\'t last long. Still, it is a good thing; you do not worry about your pot getting black soot -- the pot stays clean. It is easy to use. It's not tiresome to use. It also saves the environment, and if many people start using it, then we are going to save the environment."
22,2022-07-26,135, **Interviewer**: What can be to make the things last long?," **Interviewee**: We just need a robust a technology and the installers need to be serious and interested in the technology itself. The installers are crucial to this because they are the ones to go to for maintenance issues. Of course, some problems people can solve on their own, but some problems that need the installers themselves. Therefore, when a technology like this is introduced, they need to be available to provide necessary support."
22,2022-07-26,136, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi? Do you think it is manageable?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it is possible to have people to manage -- very much."
22,2022-07-26,137," **Interviewer**: I will put it to you, the project installers gave you not one but two digesters and none of them are working now? Do you think you deserve to say it is manageable?"," **Interviewee**: There was nothing we could have done to solve the problem. You have to analyze carefully; you have to think about who is to blame. The blame is on the project implementers. It has been two years now, but they come since the time the departed this place. When you give something to people, you need to follow up; and when you receive a complaint, you suppose act accordingly. It\`s surprising that they didn't follow up; they were suppose to come back -- we even fail to understand why they didn't come."
22,2022-07-26,138, **Interviewer**: Why did they project implementers did not come? What do you think?, **Interviewee**: I cannot think of a reason why they didn't come; I don't understand even today why they did follow up.
22,2022-07-26,139," **Interviewer**: If you have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I hear people talking using solar panels for cooking and lighting. Apart from that, I do not have any other option."
22,2022-07-26,140, **Interviewer**: Why solar panels?, **Interviewee**: Because it can be used as electricity.
22,2022-07-26,141," **Interviewer**: Then people should just bring electricity, not solar", **Interviewee**: (laughs) no.
22,2022-07-26,142, **Interviewer**: Do you have electric lines here?, **Interviewee**: We do not. What you saw are transmission lines.
22,2022-07-26,143, **Interviewer**: Okay," **Interviewee**: We can also still want biogas, but we need directly supported from project implementers. Or, even phone conversations can work; we can just be telling them our issues and get advice from them. Some of us have skills so I am sure we can be fixing the issues with just advice from a phone call. But, we can do this with support from project implementer. I believe if we can be handling issues on our own with advice from them, we can be making the problems even worse as we do not fully understand it. So, we don't need their physical presence, we just need communication."
22,2022-07-26,144," **Interviewer**: Last question, in the beginning we said you think you got this because you have skills a different people different places and skill. Now, you are telling me the same, only that this time you think it could have helped you to maintain and save it. What skills do you have?", **Interviewee**: I have a lot of talent and skills -- A lot.
22,2022-07-26,145, **Interviewer**: What skills?," **Interviewee**: I fix motorcycles, maize mills."
22,2022-07-26,146," **Interviewer**: Oh, that is impressive"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I am a mechanic. I can fix diesel powered maize meals."
22,2022-07-26,147, **Interviewer**: Where did you learn this?, **Interviewee**: I learnt this from my brother who stays in Chamtulo.
22,2022-07-26,148," **Interviewer**: Then if they could have trained you, I believe you would have managed it. I mean, If you are able to fix a diesel engine, this could have been easy peasy for you.", **Interviewee**: Yeah
22,2022-07-26,149, **Interviewer**: Let us just say they were not serious. That\`s the end of our interview. Thanks for interview.,NA
23,2022-07-26,1, **Interviewer**: Where did this digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I do not know where it came from."
23,2022-07-26,2," **Interviewer**: No, you do not know."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it has been long"
23,2022-07-26,3," **Interviewer**: Let me see between you and your daughter, so that you can help each other in answering questions. Let me put it this way, who brought it here? Was the agriculture extension worker, who has come involved?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it came with the individual you are with, \[name redacted\]."
23,2022-07-26,4, **Interviewer**: Did he come alone? How many people did he come with?," **Interviewee**: There were five people; two females, one of which was pregnant; \[name redacted\] and two other male people."
23,2022-07-26,5, **Interviewer**: You said it has been long. How long has it been? When was it built?, **Interviewee**: It was in 2016. I remember that time I was pregnant with those twins.
23,2022-07-26,6," **Interviewer**: So, they were born in 2017?", **Interviewee**: It was the same year. They were born on 28 August 2016.
23,2022-07-26,7, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to build?, **Interviewee**: It took one month from the time we started digging to the point we started using it.
23,2022-07-26,8," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. How were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: The extension worker simply told me that I was going to be given a digester. After some days, I saw him coming with people and the digester bag."
23,2022-07-26,9," **Interviewer**: So you were just told that you were getting a digester. Okay, did you ask him why they brought it to you out of all the people in this village?"," **Interviewee**: No, I did not ask."
23,2022-07-26,10, **Interviewer**: Why? What if it were bringing a bomb?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) we know the extension worker and he always comes with good news. So, we saw their coming as a blessing, and that is why we did bother to ask questions."
23,2022-07-26,11, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) what was your role?, **Interviewee**: Our role was to find cow and water.
23,2022-07-26,12, **Interviewer**: \[question inaudible\], **Interviewee**: We got water from the borehole.
23,2022-07-26,13, **Interviewer**: How many people were involved in this?, **Interviewee**: It was three people.
23,2022-07-26,14, **Interviewer**: It was three people... It sounds like you did not take part?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that time I was pregnant with my twins."
23,2022-07-26,15," **Interviewer**: Oh, yeah, yeah. It must be some years back indeed; look at them they are all grown up. Did you know anything about the digester?"," **Interviewee**: No, I did not know about digesters, and I had never heard of it too."
23,2022-07-26,16," **Interviewer**: Oh, I can imagine it was tough to explain all that to you."," **Interviewee**: No, they just say they were bringing a thing, which I was going to use for cooking."
23,2022-07-26,17, **Interviewer**: OK what were you expectations?, **Interviewee**: I was excited because I expected to stop fetching firewood.
23,2022-07-26,18, **Interviewer**: What else did you expect?, **Interviewee**: We expected to benefit.
23,2022-07-26,19, **Interviewer**: What do you mean?," **Interviewee**: We expected people to be happy when you using it, so it was a blessing (gift) to us."
23,2022-07-26,20," **Interviewer**: After installation, what did the installers say you should expect from the digester?", **Interviewee**: They just said we would be using it for cooking.
23,2022-07-26,21, **Interviewer**: Uumh, **Interviewee**: Uh
23,2022-07-26,22, **Interviewer**: Cooking what?, **Interviewee**: Cooking all types of food.
23,2022-07-26,23, **Interviewer**: Beans?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, beans. But, I did not cook beans on it, only vegetables."
23,2022-07-26,24, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: We thought it was going to take time to cook beans on it.
23,2022-07-26,25," **Interviewer**: You thought, or it took long when you tried to cook beans?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it took long when we tried to cook beans."
23,2022-07-26,26, **Interviewer**: Like how long?," **Interviewee**: eh, we did not manage to cook beans because when it run out of gas. So, to use it again we had to feed it again for it to start producing gas."
23,2022-07-26,27," **Interviewer**: Mmh, okay. What kind of training did you receive?"," **Interviewee**: We did not receive any type of training. They only came to install it, and they did not train us whatsoever."
23,2022-07-26,28," **Interviewer**: If they installed it without training, then how were you able to switch it on and off?"," **Interviewee**: They only told us how to prepare feedstock. For example, how much water we were supposed to add to the cow manure, and how to switch it on and off. So, when we wanted to cook we simply switched it on. And when we saw that the stove was switched on but no gas was not coming after feeding it we just stooped because know what to do as we did not receive training."
23,2022-07-26,29, **Interviewer**: Anything else?, **Interviewee**: That is all
23,2022-07-26,30, **Interviewer**: What did they say about feedstock?," **Interviewee**: They said the digester needed feedings. It needed to be fed with fresh manure. And, we needed to mix with feedstock with water before pouring it into the bag."
23,2022-07-26,31," **Interviewer**: Okay, we will talk about that in detail later. Did you feel you could operate with a digester with what your told training?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we thought we could operate it."
23,2022-07-26,32," **Interviewer**: You were just told how to switch it on and off, and how to make feedstock, so how?"," **Interviewee**: Because after everything, the installers only told us that it only needs feeding to produce fire, and they told us how to feed it."
23,2022-07-26,33," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay. They told you how to feed it and you were doing it accordingly?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, yeah."
23,2022-07-26,34, **Interviewer**: Some of the people I have visited were given the digester twice. How many times did you receive digester?, **Interviewee**: We only received money once.
23,2022-07-26,35," **Interviewer**: I understand the first time they installed digester bags of low-grade plastic that did not work. Then, after a year or so the installer installers this kind of digesters..."," **Interviewee**: No, they only installed this one here. It is only this one."
23,2022-07-26,36," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?", **Interviewee**: We were very much struggling and we are still struggling because we source wood from a very far please.
23,2022-07-26,37, **Interviewer**: Where?, **Interviewee**: The Mountains you are seeing; that is where we get wood.
23,2022-07-26,38," **Interviewer**: When you leave at 10 AM, what time do you return?", **Interviewee**: We return at 10 AM when you go there.
23,2022-07-26,39, **Interviewer**: After leaving what time?, **Interviewee**: Five in the morning.
23,2022-07-26,40," **Interviewer**: Oh, is that true?", **Interviewee**: Yeah \[strong affirmative\]
23,2022-07-26,41, **Interviewer**: All that time to find firewood?, **Interviewee**: (laughs heavily) yeah -- we return around this time; it is far and the paths are winding and bad.
23,2022-07-26,42," **Interviewer**: You have trees here, why cannot you just get what from here?"," **Interviewee**: Getting firewood from mango trees? No, that's our fruits, and they save us some other times."
23,2022-07-26,43," **Interviewer**: In a week, how many times do you go source firewood?"," **Interviewee**: Firewood is very scarce these days, so we got there three times a week."
23,2022-07-26,44, **Interviewer**: How many people?, **Interviewee**: Two; me and my little sister here.
23,2022-07-26,45, **Interviewer**: Why do you leave that early as you are going to the farm? Don't you feel vulnerable?," **Interviewee**: We go early to escape from the scorching heat. Also, we need to go there early, so that we can come in time to cook morning food."
23,2022-07-26,46, **Interviewer**: Did you pay for firewood there?," **Interviewee**: No, we do not."
23,2022-07-26,47, **Interviewer**: Do you use charcoal?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
23,2022-07-26,48, **Interviewer**: Do you buy?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
23,2022-07-26,49," **Interviewer**: In a month, how many bags of charcoal do you use?", **Interviewee**: We use three bags since our family is huge.
23,2022-07-26,50, **Interviewer**: How many people are you in this family?, **Interviewee**: We are 16.
23,2022-07-26,51," **Interviewer**: Oh, that is a lot of people; you may need the three bags or even more. Do you differentiate cooking on firewood and biogas?", **Interviewee**: It's faster to cook on biogas than on firewood.
23,2022-07-26,52," **Interviewer**: How do you exactly compared the two in terms of cooking time, let's take nsima for example?"," **Interviewee**: It takes less than 30 minutes to cook on biogas, and it takes about 45 minutes to cooking nsima on firewood, and it take even longer to cook nsima on charcoal. It takes one hour or so to have everything ready on charcoal."
23,2022-07-26,53, **Interviewer**: Do you difference the taste of food cooked on biogas and on firewood? Some people say chips fried cooked on firewood taste better than that cooked on charcoal or a cooker., **Interviewee**: It tastes the same.
23,2022-07-26,54, **Interviewer**: Where did you get manure for your biogas?, **Interviewee**: From our cow house.
23,2022-07-26,55, **Interviewer**: How many cows do you have?, **Interviewee**: I have 16 cows.
23,2022-07-26,56," **Interviewer**: Oh, that\'s a lot. How many did you have when the digester came?", **Interviewee**: We had 10 cows. We could have had more than 16 cows but we have sold some of them.
23,2022-07-26,57, **Interviewer**: How did you manage feedstock before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: We used the cow as fertilizer in our fields.
23,2022-07-26,58, **Interviewer**: Where are your fields?, **Interviewee**: Within in the house.
23,2022-07-26,59," **Interviewer**: In a month, how many bags where you making the time?", **Interviewee**: It's a lot of manure.
23,2022-07-26,60, **Interviewer**: Like how much?, **Interviewee**: A lot and it's not like I am the only person who get manure from the cow house. A lot of people within the community come to get manure from my cow house -- a lot of them.
23,2022-07-26,61," **Interviewer**: Okay, do you sell?"," **Interviewee**: No, we just give them free."
23,2022-07-26,62, **Interviewer**: Why? That's a business opportunity.," **Interviewee**: No, we just feel like helping others so that they can be assisted with their crops too (Laughs)"
23,2022-07-26,63," **Interviewer**: (laughs) you are missing a business opportunity, I'm just saying. Do you add organic fertilizer to boost the manure?", **Interviewee**: We don't add inorganic fertilizer.
23,2022-07-26,64, **Interviewer**: Say you don't buy fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, our fields are fertile so cow manure is sufficient."
23,2022-07-26,65, **Interviewer**: Have you ever used inorganic fertilizer before?, **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
23,2022-07-26,66, **Interviewer**: Is it possible to grow maize in Malawi without fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. But at one point, we were growing tobacco and that's when we were using inorganic fertilizer."
23,2022-07-26,67, **Interviewer**: Why did you use inorganic fertilizer instead of cow manure for tobacco?," **Interviewee**: Cow dung as fertilizer is not suitable for tobacco. It's not strong enough for tobacco. But, it suits perfectly with maize."
23,2022-07-26,68," **Interviewer**: Before the digester starts working, you feed it with a huge amount of feedstock and water to start up. How much money and water did you start it up with?", **Interviewee**: I can only remember the amount of water that we added to the feedstock. It was 5 basin of water.
23,2022-07-26,69, **Interviewer**: Which basin?, **Interviewee**: That one
23,2022-07-26,70," **Interviewer**: Oh, a 6- liter basin. How much manure did you use?"," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I don\'t know."
23,2022-07-26,71," **Interviewer**: How come you remember the amount of water that you used, and not the manure you used?", **Interviewee**: It\'s because my husband was the one responsible for preparing the feedstock; I did not take part in the mixing. I was only involved in gathering the water.
23,2022-07-26,72, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start it up?, **Interviewee**: It took two weeks.
23,2022-07-26,73," **Interviewer**: Okay, so after two weeks you started using it. How did it work after commissioning?"," **Interviewee**: But, before commissioning it, we were told to wait for the bag to produce gas. After two weeks, the bag got full, then we tried it, and it produced fire."
23,2022-07-26,74," **Interviewer**: Who tried it? Were you just told me how to start it up, or installer were there too?", **Interviewee**: The installers came to try it and to give us a heads up.
23,2022-07-26,75," **Interviewer**: Okay, so after commissioning how did it work? How much cooking time did you get? Were you able to cook three times a day?"," **Interviewee**: Not the whole day, it had time limits."
23,2022-07-26,76, **Interviewer**: What was the limit?," **Interviewee**: It was starting to work after 10 AM because around that time the bag was full and had gas to use for cook dish lunch. And, at around 1 or 2 PM, the bag would deflate that it was producing very, very little or no gas, and then it would not produce gas any more."
23,2022-07-26,77," **Interviewer**: And, this was after commissioning. You were able to cook lunch. How much cooking time are we talking about?", **Interviewee**: Around 1 or 2 hours of cooking time.
23,2022-07-26,78, **Interviewer**: Were you able to use after 1 or 2 PM?," **Interviewee**: No, after those 2 hours we were waiting for the following day to use it again, around 10 or 11 AM."
23,2022-07-26,79, **Interviewer**: You said you couldn't remember the amount of manure you use to start it up. But you remember to used five basins (60 liters) of water to start it up. Where did you get the water and the man?," **Interviewee**: We got the water from a borehole within the community, and as for the manure, we got from our cow house."
23,2022-07-26,80, **Interviewer**: How far are you from the water source?," **Interviewee**: Not far, it's just there \[100 -- 200 meters\]."
23,2022-07-26,81," **Interviewer**: After commissioning, how often did you feed it? And, how much did you feed it?"," **Interviewee**: We were feeding it every morning because they told us to use cow manure. So, every morning before the cows went for grazing we were getting the fresh manure for feeding it."
23,2022-07-26,82, **Interviewer**: Daily?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, everyday."
23,2022-07-26,83, **Interviewer**: Yow much feedstock?, **Interviewee**: Five or six buckets (20 liters) of fresh cow manure.
23,2022-07-26,84, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add?, **Interviewee**: We usually used 3 or 4 buckets of water.
23,2022-07-26,85, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We were mixing cow manure and water with hands, and then feed the thoroughly mixed slurry into the digester."
23,2022-07-26,86," **Interviewer**: So, you were doing that with gloves?"," **Interviewee**: No, just with bare hands -- there installers didn't bring gloves."
23,2022-07-26,87, **Interviewer**: Did you feel gross?," **Interviewee**: Ah, on, we wanted development."
23,2022-07-26,88, **Interviewer**: Do you have to do uncomfortable things in the name of development? Should development be a burden (Laugh)?, **Interviewee**: (Laughs) No.
23,2022-07-26,89, **Interviewer**: You are saying you were mixing the feedstock with water. Who was responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: My husband.
23,2022-07-26,90," **Interviewer**: (Laughs) that's why you are saying you go the extra mile when it\`s development because it wasn't you handling the feedstock, right? (Laughs)", **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
23,2022-07-26,91, **Interviewer**: Was it only him?," **Interviewee**: No, the children supported him as well."
23,2022-07-26,92, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about it?," **Interviewee**: It was not a problem too, because most of the times we were drawing water."
23,2022-07-26,93, **Interviewer**: How many people used the gas?, **Interviewee**: It was 16 people
23,2022-07-26,94," **Interviewer**: This thing produces fertilizer, did they tell you about fertilizer?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, they did."
23,2022-07-26,95, **Interviewer**: What did they say?," **Interviewee**: They said when it is a full it produces digestate, and indeed when it was full, it was producing digestate which we used as fertilizer in our farm."
23,2022-07-26,96, **Interviewer**: How often was it releasing digestate?, **Interviewee**: When the bag was full.
23,2022-07-26,97, **Interviewer**: Daily?, **Interviewee**: It was producing the digestate daily long as it was feed and full. So we used to get the digestate and use it in our farms.
23,2022-07-26,98, **Interviewer**: How was your outlet like? Was it just a hole or you put a basin?, **Interviewee**: We simply dug a hole so that digestate would fall into the hole.
23,2022-07-26,99, **Interviewer**: How big was the hole?," **Interviewee**: I think it was one meter. So, we were waiting for the hole to fill up to take the digestate to the farm. Mostly the hole was the filing up in two or three days."
23,2022-07-26,100, **Interviewer**: Were you selling the digestate?, **Interviewee**: No people were just coming to get it.
23,2022-07-26,101," **Interviewer**: Oh, you people are givers. How did the people feel about feeding it?", **Interviewee**: They were not complaining because they wanted the innovation.
23,2022-07-26,102, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?, **Interviewee**: It just requires constant feeding like I said earlier on.
23,2022-07-26,103, **Interviewer**: What else?, **Interviewee**: Nothing else.
23,2022-07-26,104, **Interviewer**: What was to happen if there was a pipe burst or a leakage?, **Interviewee**: They did not train us anything regarding that. They just said that if there was a problem we should consult the extension workers.
23,2022-07-26,105, **Interviewer**: Did it meet your needs?, **Interviewee**: It did not meet our needs because we were not able to cook some of the things.
23,2022-07-26,106, **Interviewer**: So you were using both firewood and the digester?,\[response inaudible\]
23,2022-07-26,107," **Interviewer**: Oh, that was tough. What were the challenges?"," **Interviewee**: The challenge was that sometimes when we put the pot on the stove; it could not even heat up. Therefore, we used to go around searching for firewood so that we could continue cooking. Sometimes, around 11AM we could see the bag was full, but no gas was coming at the stove despite feeding it with manure and loads of water. Sometimes, it would produce very little gas would make the food became uncooked. So, they fire could come, but it was very weak just like of a candle light."
23,2022-07-26,108, **Interviewer**: So what were you doing to make the gas strong again?," **Interviewee**: On some particular day, you would just put a pot and you would get strong fire. So, it depend on what particular day it was. So, yeah, sometimes we could cook nsima on it. However, sometime even if we fed it and the bag was full, it could not just produce gas."
23,2022-07-26,109, **Interviewer**: How long did it work before it stopped working?, **Interviewee**: Two years.
23,2022-07-26,110," **Interviewer**: So in two year you were just using it in the afternoon? And, sometimes you could not even cook on it because there was no gas?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
23,2022-07-26,111," **Interviewer**: Was there a day you used it in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening?", **Interviewee**: No. That's was just not possible. It was starting to work after the sun was out around 10:00 and 11:00 in the morning.
23,2022-07-26,112, **Interviewer**: What days were you able to cook? Was it random or there was something about those days?," **Interviewee**: It was just random. Sometimes, it would work for a straight one week without problem \[just in the afternoon\]."
23,2022-07-26,113," **Interviewer**: So general in the 2 years, most times the gas was coming at the stove, it is just that some days the fire was very, very weak; and on some days, and sometimes the fire was good?", **Interviewee**: Spot on!
23,2022-07-26,114," **Interviewer**: But, after 2 years, that is when it stopped producing gas?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it stopped producing fire completely."
23,2022-07-26,115, **Interviewer**: When it was not working properly like the times it was producing little gas did you call the project implementers?," **Interviewee**: We reported the issue to the extension worker and he told us that he would inform the installers. But, they never came up to the point it completely failed."
23,2022-07-26,116, **Interviewer**: Did you follow up again?, **Interviewee**: No.
23,2022-07-26,117, **Interviewer**: Why did you not keep on follow up?," **Interviewee**: Aah, we thought the message was clear, and you cannot go to their office all the time because they were occupied with other work as well."
23,2022-07-26,118, **Interviewer**: What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?, **Interviewee**: The information would have helped us because you could just have been referring to it whenever we had a problem to fix it. And maybe if we had that information it could have been working even today.
23,2022-07-26,119, **Interviewer**: Why are you so confident?," **Interviewee**: Because we were very committed to feed it, and our feeding was perfect. And, when we had no cow manure, we were going to our uncle, that house there, to get feedstock to feed it."
23,2022-07-26,120, **Interviewer**: How do you describe the current state of digested today?, **Interviewee**: It is no longer in existence. It is not there.
23,2022-07-26,121, **Interviewer**: How did it reach this stage?," **Interviewee**: The way it was behaving, it was as if we were working for nothing; also, the bag got a hole. Then after that, it got buried in the ground. So the time it was producing very little gas it had no hole anyway?"
23,2022-07-26,122," **Interviewer**: How did it get punctured? And, what kind of hole was it?"," **Interviewee**: The bag got puncture on its own underneath while it was in the hole. So, when we were feeding it the bag was not getting full."
23,2022-07-26,123, **Interviewer**: How did you know that it had punctured?," **Interviewee**: It was because the bag could not get full even after feeding. Previously, we wanted to find out how much gas was in the bag, we used to ask the children to jump on the bag. So that time when the children jumped on it, they stopped bouncing and they were going down with it."
23,2022-07-26,124, **Interviewer**: Who told you that children should be stepping on it to check if there was gas?, **Interviewee**: They did not tell us but we started doing that ourselves to know if there was gas in the bag or not.
23,2022-07-26,125," **Interviewer**: (laughs) why do you think it got punctured? Or, what specifically punctured it?"," **Interviewee**: Mmh, we do not know."
23,2022-07-26,126, **Interviewer**: You cannot think of anything?, **Interviewee**: We cannot.
23,2022-07-26,127, **Interviewer**: How to meet your energy needs now that it is not working?," **Interviewee**: We use the firewood and charcoal. Nowadays, we eat very late because it takes us time to find firewood; we eat very late these days."
23,2022-07-26,128, **Interviewer**: (laugh) is there anything wrong with eating late?," **Interviewee**: There is problem, because when we go to farm in the morning we go with empty stomachs, so we expect that we should eat right after returning -- so we see that as a problem."
23,2022-07-26,129," **Interviewer**: I am having lunch here today, what time are we eating?", **Interviewee**: We have already eaten.
23,2022-07-26,130," **Interviewer**: You are telling me you eat late, but this is 1:30 PM and you have already eaten.", **Interviewee**: (laughs) we didn't go to the farm today.
23,2022-07-26,131, **Interviewer**: How many times do you eat in a day?, **Interviewee**: We eat twice.
23,2022-07-26,132, **Interviewer**: How do you manage the feedstock now that it is not working?, **Interviewee**: It's in the cow house now waiting to be taken to the farm.
23,2022-07-26,133," **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview, how much did the reactor cost?"," **Interviewee**: We don't know how much it cost, but it must be a lot. And, on our side, we lost a lot of money too in terms of paying the people who dug it, and also for building a wall around it. On top of that, we built the kitchen to block the wind from the stove."
23,2022-07-26,134, **Interviewer**: Who paid for the kitchen?, **Interviewee**: It was them.
23,2022-07-26,135, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything any kind?, **Interviewee**: The cow manure was ours.
23,2022-07-26,136," **Interviewer**: What else, bricks?", **Interviewee**: The bricks were ours.
23,2022-07-26,137, **Interviewer**: How much money did you spend on that?, **Interviewee**: It was K6000.
23,2022-07-26,138, **Interviewer**: Did it save you money the time it was working?, **Interviewee**: Yeah... It helped us to save the money that we were spending on charcoal.
23,2022-07-26,139," **Interviewer**: So, you reduced buying charcoal?"," **Interviewee**: No, we stopped completely. We were using firewood and biogas only; when it stopped, that's when we started using charcoal. And, because we want to cook fast, we put one pot on firewood for side dish, and another pot on charcoal... So we started using charcoal when it failed."
23,2022-07-26,140," **Interviewer**: You said you were only using it in the afternoon, so how were you cooking that time?", **Interviewee**: We were using firewood when biogas was not working.
23,2022-07-26,141, **Interviewer**: So your primary source of energy is firewood?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
23,2022-07-26,142," **Interviewer**: So, that time you were saving three bags of charcoal?",\[response inaudible\]
23,2022-07-26,143, **Interviewer**: How much was a bag of charcoal that time?, **Interviewee**: It was K4500.
23,2022-07-26,144, **Interviewer**: How much is it now?, **Interviewee**: It's K6000 or K7000
23,2022-07-26,145," **Interviewer**: Oh, things are expensive now, uh. What was the biggest difference in your life that time it was working?"," **Interviewee**: This were a bit easy that time; and our school going kids were finding food ready after knocking off from school. It was like after knocking off at 12 noon they would find food. But now it's tough. And, one thing about the digester is that we knew its cooking time, so we were forced to cook within that particular time, and that\`s why the children always found food ready."
23,2022-07-26,146," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. We are remaining with two questions, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: If you could bring another biogas, then you should take us to training so that we should learn about it. And, the training should focus on how to fix it, and even how to make it work in the evening. I think that way it can work."
23,2022-07-26,147, **Interviewer**: What are its props and cons?," **Interviewee**: The good thing about it is that you eat on time. The other thing was that it was a new thing in this community. So, to have it was special because we felt that we were above everyone. And, it made this house like a learning center, because many people were coming to learn about it, and they admired it. The main challenge though is the feedstock, sometimes we had to get a bucket or too from our uncle."
23,2022-07-26,148, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi? Is the future bright or groom?," **Interviewee**: The future is bright, like I said many people were coming to see it, and they showed interest."
23,2022-07-26,149," **Interviewer**: We are in 2022, you had it in 2016-17, and you are telling me that people wanted it but no one today has it, even you yourself don't have it. So, how is the future bright?"," **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us that after it has stopped working, we could buy it in the shops, or what can we do after. Also, we didn't go for training, so we can't advocate someone to buy it because we may fail to help him or her if it fails.... So, it's hard."
23,2022-07-26,150," **Interviewer**: So, for it to have a future there must be training?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, because after that that's when you can be telling people to do this and that, and only them you can spark the interest in people. People were asking a lot of questions but we were failing to answer, so how could we tell them to buy it or how could they have been convinced by us when we seemed not to understand it."
23,2022-07-26,151, **Interviewer**: What questions were you receiving?, **Interviewee**: People were asking us how we got it; and what they can do to get it; and where to get it -- lots of questions. But we had no responses to these questions. We were just telling them that they told us to feed it with cow manure (Laughs). And then we would take them to the stove to show them the gas.
23,2022-07-26,152," **Interviewer**: (laughs) if you would have design your on the waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?", **Interviewee**: We are not educated so we don't know which technologies we can use or are available... we only saw them bring this technology and we accepted it.
23,2022-07-26,153, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) you don't electricity?, **Interviewee**: We want that.
23,2022-07-26,154, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you tell me that?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) yeah, electricity can help a lot too."
23,2022-07-26,155, **Interviewer**: That was my last question. Thanks for the interview.,NA
24,2022-07-26,1,Where did this digester originate from?,"It came with \[name redacted\], the agriculture extension worker -- When he came, he identified a place and told us to dig a hole for the digester to be placed. Simply put it came with me our extension worker, \[name redacted\]."
24,2022-07-26,2,When was this?,"It has been three years. It was 2018, if not 2017."
24,2022-07-26,3,Who built it?,"Four people built it; they line the digester with a brick wall; prepared the feedstock to start it up, and of course, draw water to feed it and other things."
24,2022-07-26,4,Who were these four people?,"It was two us, and two other people; we hired them to assist us with the work."
24,2022-07-26,5,How much did you pay them?,We paid them K5000.
24,2022-07-26,6,How long did it take to build the digester?,"Firstly, they told us to dig a hole, and then build a brick wall around it. Then, they told us to wait for a day to allow the brick wall to dry. The following day, they came and installed the digester bag. They also made a structure for the stove on the same day. All this took three days."
24,2022-07-26,7,"I take it that it was not just the four of you, who were involved in the building process. I believe the four of you worked with the people who brought the digester. How many people from the installation of company were involved in the construction or installation process?","There was \[name redacted\] and two other extension workers of which one was short and dark in complexion. On top of this, there were two other people. They were not from this community nor extension workers."
24,2022-07-26,8,"Okay**,** what was your role?","Our main role was to find people to make a hole for the digester bag and to prepare feedstock to start it up. Besides this, we were also responsible for sourcing bricks for making a brick wall around the hole. Therefore, we went around the community to find a broken bricks for the wall. Nowadays, you cannot do that."
24,2022-07-26,9, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: People do sell broken bricks these days. It is just not possible to find broken bricks going free of charge like in the past
24,2022-07-26,10, **Interviewer**: What has changed really?," **Interviewee**: Everything is about money now. In the past, we could go to a brick clamp or a house construction, and get broken bricks free and build a pit latrine. Now people ask for money even for broken bricks."
24,2022-07-26,11," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. How were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: It was \[name redacted\], the extension worker, who identify us. In this community only two people were given the digester, it \[name redacted\] and I."
24,2022-07-26,12," **Interviewer**: Why do you think you were chosen? I mean, you are too many people in this community, why you?"," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) they chose us because we had cows, I think. There was a cow house there. That is my mother."
24,2022-07-26,13," **Interviewer**: Hello, mom. Yeah, we are doing a research about biogas. I came in June in preparation of this visit. I hope you were told. Right now, we are just chatting about your experiences with the digester."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they give me this digester. However, after commissioning, I could only cook porridge and vegetables. After a little time, it stopped producing gas; it was on and off."
24,2022-07-26,14," **Interviewer**: Okay, then you can join us. I understand it has been many years, so it would be wonderful if you can join us and remind each other some of the things. I was asking my sister here why they chose you to be a beneficiary, and she told me it is because that time you had cows..."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and that is true. It was because of the cows."
24,2022-07-26,15, **Interviewer**: How many cows did you have?," **Interviewee**: We had 10 cows, but I was not the sole owner."
24,2022-07-26,16, **Interviewer**: what do you mean?," **Interviewee**: Out of the 10 Cowboys, four were mine. The rest of the cows where brought by other people so that I could keep for them."
24,2022-07-26,17, **Interviewer**: Why asking you to keep for them?, **Interviewee**: They so that it was secure for them to keep the cows here; they had challenges keeping the cow.
24,2022-07-26,18, **Interviewer**: How many people?, **Interviewee**: Two people
24,2022-07-26,19," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you know anything about biogas?"," **Interviewee**: No, I did not."
24,2022-07-26,20, **Interviewer**: Sister did you know anything about biogas?, **Interviewee#2**: No
24,2022-07-26,21, **Interviewer**: So it was a new thing for both of you?, **Interviewee**: It was a new thing to many; it was not only us.
24,2022-07-26,22, **Interviewer**: \[no question\]," **Interviewee#2**: and people were coming to see it. I used to show them how to feed it and how the bag gets full after feeding. Moreover, then I would show them how to operate it."
24,2022-07-26,23," **Interviewer**: Oh nice, did you show them how to cook nsima on biogas and all that?"," **Interviewee**: Mmh, no nsima. The firewood was not staying long, by now it could have stopped \[referencing the time taken for the interview (about 25 minutes)\]."
24,2022-07-26,24," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: I thought I was very lucky. In this community, only two of us benefited. So, we accepted the digester because we thought we were lucky to have it."
24,2022-07-26,25, **Interviewer**: You thought you had hit a jackpot.," **Interviewee**: (laughs) Yeah, so we thought I would use it for cooking. So, we expected to stop going around searching for firewood. We expected to have rest; we expected to take a break from sourcing firewood."
24,2022-07-26,26, **Interviewer**: Where do you get firewood?, **Interviewee**: At the mountains.
24,2022-07-26,27, **Interviewer**: How far?, **Interviewee**: We leave in the morning and return after 12 or 1 PM.
24,2022-07-26,28, **Interviewer**: What time exactly in the morning?, **Interviewee**: We leave around 5 am
24,2022-07-26,29," **Interviewer**: eh, eh, it\`s far."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, is very far. The mountain is far from here."
24,2022-07-26,30," **Interviewer**: I thought you have trees around, why do you not just you use the trees from within?"," **Interviewee**: The mango trees? No! The trees give us fruits, my son"
24,2022-07-26,31, **Interviewer**: I understand it is not easy to get wood from mountains. You think of forest officers and everything. How is it like that side?," **Interviewee**: No, it is just like woodland. Plus, we have relatives who own land around, so we ask and get firewood from them."
24,2022-07-26,32," **Interviewer**: Okay, so when \[name redacted\] and his team came, what did they say you should expect from with the digester? What did they say about the digester?"," **Interviewee**: They build the digester here so that I could use it for cooking -- And when things were working I reported to \[name redacted\]. He came and saw that it was not producing enough; and, he told us that the digester was not producing gas as it was supposed to."
24,2022-07-26,33, **Interviewer**: \[no question\]," **Interviewee#2**: So, when he came that time and saw it producing little gas, we expected him to bring a new digester that we could use without problems."
24,2022-07-26,34," **Interviewer**: Okay, did they tell you that it could use it for lighting?", **Interviewee**: They did not -- This one was only meant for cooking.
24,2022-07-26,35, **Interviewer**: What type of training did you receive from the installers?," **Interviewee**: They simply told me to feed it with six bags of cow manure. They said after feeding it, I will be able to know that it was good by just looking at how the bag was inflated. And, when the bag was full, they came and they showed me how to switch it on."
24,2022-07-26,36, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you about maintenance?, **Interviewee**: No.
24,2022-07-26,37, **Interviewer**: What did they tell you to do when the bag was not getting full?," **Interviewee**: They told us to feed it with food leftovers and everything decomposes, and we were doing just that."
24,2022-07-26,38, **Interviewer**: How prepared to run or operate the digester did you feel were?," **Interviewee**: Very much so. And, we loved the digester, and we embraced it."
24,2022-07-26,39, **Interviewer**: So you felt what they told you was enough to operate it and maintain it?," **Interviewee**: yeah, that is what we were told, and we thought it was fine."
24,2022-07-26,40, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? Did you use anything apart from firewood?," **Interviewee**: Like I said, we get wood from the mountains. So, when this came we are so happy, and thought it was our time to stop going to the mountains to look forward."
24,2022-07-26,41," **Interviewer**: Now, if you want to cook, do you still go there?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we still go there."
24,2022-07-26,42, **Interviewer**: how is the situation there? Is firewood not depleting?, **Interviewee**: it is depleting... Its depleted because of people who go there to cut trees to make charcoal.
24,2022-07-26,43," **Interviewer**: Then, how are you going to survive?", **Interviewee**: We do not know -- You should help us with alternatives.
24,2022-07-26,44, **Interviewer**: (laugh) oh," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) and as you can see, I am getting old. The last time they cheated to me about using it for cooking, so you need to support me on finding a solution to cooking."
24,2022-07-26,45," **Interviewer**: Let us assume, I am not there, how are you going to survive?"," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) you do not have to disappear. Do not shun us (laughs)! But, if worse come to worse, we will leave with no option, but on depend on maize stalk. But we cannot and do not rely on that, because it is somewhat seasonal."
24,2022-07-26,46, **Interviewer**: You said you had 10 cows; four were yours and six were from other people. How many do you have now?, **Interviewee**: We do not have any. Thieves stole from us.
24,2022-07-26,47," **Interviewer**: Oh, true?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, you can even ask the kids. We tried everything to get it back, but couldn\'t."
24,2022-07-26,48, **Interviewer**: When was this?, **Interviewee**: Last year. They only left us with one cow.
24,2022-07-26,49," **Interviewer**: In most cases, people go to tradition witchdoctors after such an event, especially in cow farming. What did you do?"," **Interviewee**: Eh, we tried literally everything -- And it is not only us, many people from the village were robbed that day. I am sure they used strong juju \[black magic\], because that cannot just happen. And, when we went to witch doctors nothing happened, so I am sure they used strong juju."
24,2022-07-26,50, **Interviewer**: Sorry for your loss. How did you manage the feedstock before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: We simply gathered and processed the manure, and later use it as manure in our fields. That time I was able to gather 5 bags (50 kg) of manure, but if a man was doing that, he could have gathering more. So, from that I was able to harvest16 bags (50 kg) of manure."
24,2022-07-26,51," **Interviewer**: Oh impressive, how much manure did you start it up with?", **Interviewee**: We started with six or seven buckets (20 kg) of cow manure.
24,2022-07-26,52, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the manure?, **Interviewee**: I got it from my cow house.
24,2022-07-26,53, **Interviewer**: How much water did add?," **Interviewee**: We started it with 5 buckets of (20 liters) of water. And, it was lot of work to prepare the feedstock at the first time. But, afterwards it was simple because we were feeding it a bucket or so."
24,2022-07-26,54, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: From a borehole.
24,2022-07-26,55, **Interviewer**: How far is it from here?, **Interviewee**: So far is there?
24,2022-07-26,56, **Interviewer**: That is 400 or 500 meters away. How long did it take to start up?, **Interviewee**: It took one week.
24,2022-07-26,57, **Interviewer**: How did it start after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: After feeding it with the initial feedstock, we waited for a week for it to start up. During that week, the bag was getting bigger and bigger each day. On the 7^th^ day, it got full. Unfortunately, the gas we got was not strong enough to cook nsima. Like I said, I was only using it for cooking vegetables and porridge or light side dishes \[15 -- 30 minutes\]. And it was always on and off; sometimes we could switch it on and got little gas; sometimes we did not get gas at all."
24,2022-07-26,58," **Interviewer**: Specifically, how much cooking time did you get when it worked? Were you able to cook breakfast lunch and supper?"," **Interviewee**: No, as I said, we could not cook on nsima on it. We only used it for cooking porridge and vegetables."
24,2022-07-26,59," **Interviewer**: Okay, that is like 15 or so minutes of gas. Apart from cooking, did you use it for any other purpose?"," **Interviewee**: No, it was only for cooking."
24,2022-07-26,60, **Interviewer**: How many people used it?, **Interviewee**: We were 3 people.
24,2022-07-26,61, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: For it to function, it needed to be fed with cow manure. They also told us to feed it with food leftovers."
24,2022-07-26,62, **Interviewer**: How often did you feed the digester?, **Interviewee**: Once we saw that the bag was not full.
24,2022-07-26,63, **Interviewer**: So you were basically waiting on it to shrink to feed?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, once we saw that the bag was not going to get full, that\'s when we were feeding it."
24,2022-07-26,64, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you feed it on a daily basis?," **Interviewee**: I do not know if it was laziness, but in most cases it was taking as three or four days to feed it."
24,2022-07-26,65, **Interviewer**: Did the installers tell you how you were supposed to feed it?, **Interviewee**: They did
24,2022-07-26,66, **Interviewer**: What did they say?," **Interviewee**: They told us to feed it with cow manure, but my thinking was it was not going to take time provided again or to use it."
24,2022-07-26,67, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We were simply putting the manure in a bucket, add water, and mix with a wooden stir or stick. After mixing, we were pouring the mixer into the digester bag."
24,2022-07-26,68, **Interviewer**: Many people have told me that they were advised to use hand instead of stir to have good slurry. What is your take?, **Interviewee**: We were also getting good slurry using a stick because some of the manure was fresh.
24,2022-07-26,69, **Interviewer**: You were also using dry manure?," **Interviewee**: We were just collecting manure, so some of the manure was dry."
24,2022-07-26,70," **Interviewer**: Were you pre-treating the feedstock? For example, did you soak the manure for a certain time before feeding it?"," **Interviewee**: No, we were just mixing the manure after collecting it from the cow house."
24,2022-07-26,71," **Interviewer**: What was ratio of your feedstock? I mean, how much water were you adding to the manure?"," **Interviewee**: Mostly, I was feeding it with seven buckets (20 liters) cow manure, and I was adding seven buckets (20 liters) of water."
24,2022-07-26,72," **Interviewer**: OK, So, it was a 1:1 ratio. Who was responsible for feeding it?", **Interviewee**: I was responsible
24,2022-07-26,73, **Interviewer**: What about my sister here?, **Interviewee**: She was also supporting me
24,2022-07-26,74, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the task of feeding it?," **Interviewee**: It\'s hard work. But, it's worth it, if it can work without issues."
24,2022-07-26,75," **Interviewer**: In your case, was it worth it?"," **Interviewee**: The fact that we did not use it for cooking nsima, it's hard to say it was worth it. You know in Malawi, eating is synonym to nsima (laughs). Nsima is everything!"
24,2022-07-26,76, **Interviewer**: Did you get fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: The installer told us that after feeding it for some time, it produces digestate that can be used as fertilizer. They also told us that what remain I the bag is fertilizer, so when it stopped we got and used it as fertilizer."
24,2022-07-26,77, **Interviewer**: What was your outlet like?," **Interviewee**: We dug a hole onto which the digester was flowing in. They told us that we could use the digester as fertilizer, so we used to collect the digestate and apply it in our farms."
24,2022-07-26,78, **Interviewer**: What was your take on the digestate? How did you compare it with inorganic fertilizer or the fertilizer you where getting from you manure?," **Interviewee**: We don't use inorganic fertilizer. But, when we used the digestate, it worked."
24,2022-07-26,79, **Interviewer**: Why don't you use in organic fertilizer?, **Interviewee**: We can\'t afford it - we don\'t have money to buy inorganic fertilizer.
24,2022-07-26,80, **Interviewer**: Now that you have only one cow. What will you do?," **Interviewee**: My sister has a cow house, so I have moved the remaining cow to her place."
24,2022-07-26,81, **Interviewer**: So you will get manure from her?, **Interviewee**: I will probably get manure from her.
24,2022-07-26,82," **Interviewer**: You sound so unsure, I mean, what is the plan now regarding fertilizer now that you don't cows?", **Interviewee**: I will grow maize without any fertilizer.
24,2022-07-26,83, **Interviewer**: Is it possible in Malawi to grow maize without fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I do grow maize without fertilizer. What can I do when I don't have the money?"
24,2022-07-26,84, **Interviewer**: And you do harvest enough?," **Interviewee**: Of course, we do get low yield. But, what can we do, my son?"
24,2022-07-26,85," **Interviewer**: yeah, I see it's tough. What were the maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: The only told us to feed it, and after that feeding it for a long time, it was going to start producing manure -- So that was what I was doing."
24,2022-07-26,86, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you anything about how to fix or repair it?, **Interviewee**: No.
24,2022-07-26,87, **Interviewer**: Did it meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: Maybe, if it was installed properly, it would have met our needs. And, I think, had it worked as I expected, I would have the happiest person because I expected a lot; I expected it to take away all my cooking problems... I don't know if it was your team or not, who came to ask me similar questions and gave me three bundles of wood at the end."
24,2022-07-26,88," **Interviewer**: No, it wasn\`t us. It seems it did not meet your needs, because you could not cook nsima and the like, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I couldn't cook in nsima; if I could have cooked nsima on it, it would have been just one portion of nsima; I couldn't cook nsima for two people."
24,2022-07-26,89, **Interviewer**: What challenges were there?, **Interviewee**: It didn't work us one would do expect. I expected that I could use it for cooking but I never did.
24,2022-07-26,90, **Interviewer**: Could you describe the fire you were getting?," **Interviewee**: It was produce very little fire green in color. And, it was only producing fire for a very short time, after a short time it was going off completely."
24,2022-07-26,91, **Interviewer**: How much time was it?," **Interviewee**: Just enough to cook porridge. After cooking porridge, it could not produce fire."
24,2022-07-26,92, **Interviewer**: Maybe 15 - 30 minutes?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
24,2022-07-26,93, **Interviewer**: How long did it work before it stopped?," **Interviewee**: It worked for two or three months, after that it stopped completely. Then, I reported to \[name redacted\], the extension worker, who told me to wait, and hope that the installers would come again."
24,2022-07-26,94, **Interviewer**: So you only used it for two months.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it worked for three months. After that, it stopped completely. I don't know how the other beneficiaries fared though."
24,2022-07-26,95," **Interviewer**: Most of them they did fare like yours; two months, one month, one week, but there is one who used it for two years.", **Interviewee**: Two years? \[Surprised\]
24,2022-07-26,96," **Interviewer**: Yeah, they told me it was only working around lunchtime though."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that\'s how it was for all of us. And, when we met and asked each other, the stories were kind of the same."
24,2022-07-26,97," **Interviewer**: You are saying after it failed you reported to \[name redacted\], is there anything else you did before you reported to \[name redacted\]? Did you try to fix it?"," **Interviewee**: No, we just reported to \[name redacted\]. When he came, he just moved around the bag. Then, he said we should just hope that the installers would one day come again."
24,2022-07-26,98, **Interviewer**: How long did it take him to come after you report?," **Interviewee**: He was quick. He came on the same day. And, when we met him on the road he would tell me not to worry, and that the installers would come one day."
24,2022-07-26,99," **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. We have done 80% of the interview. Moving on, have you ever seen something like this \[intervention sheet\]?", **Interviewee**: No
24,2022-07-26,100," **Interviewer**: What do you think of this type of information, and do you think it would have helped you?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it would have helped."
24,2022-07-26,101, **Interviewer**: How?, **Interviewee**: We would have learned more about the digester from that information.
24,2022-07-26,102, **Interviewer**: Why would that be important?," **Interviewee**: It would have helped. This information is like you have been given a phone number. If you are given a phone number and you have a problem, you look for the contact and then make a call. In the same manner, if there was a problem, we could have been going to this information and act accordingly."
24,2022-07-26,103," **Interviewer**: Okay, today is 26 July. How do you describe the state your digester today?"," **Interviewee**: Of all the things that I was given I'm only remaining with the pipes. As you can see, we have children running around so they misplaced everything. Thus, most of the things were damaged or lost because of them. Everything is lost except for the pipes and its inside. Also, we do have the bag, it\`s there on the roof structure. \[Interrupted by another woman\]"
24,2022-07-26,104," **Interviewer**: Yeah, you are telling me it's dead; all the things are lost except for the pipes and the digester bag, which is now a roof sheet.", **Interviewee**: Yeah. It's dead. We only have the pipes and digester bag.
24,2022-07-26,105," **Interviewer**: Okay, why do you think it failed?"," **Interviewee**: It's because of how it worked after it was commissioned. I reported to \[name redacted\] how it was working, but nothing happened. So, it was more like throwing away a piece of cloth on the ground and leaving it there. What happens? You find it eaten and damaged by the termites."
24,2022-07-26,106, **Interviewer**: So you are saying it reached this state because it never really got off well and the installers did not follow-up?," **Interviewee**: Yep, it is because of the installers. They left us in the middle of the journey; they did not come to service it when it malfunctioned. But, let me not pull them down, I might be wrong."
24,2022-07-26,107," **Interviewer**: Oh, (laughs) why? You think you would not be fair to them?"," **Interviewee**: They gave us the digester, which is kindness on its own and then told us to feed it, so maybe we did not feed it right."
24,2022-07-26,108," **Interviewer**: Why do you say that? And, how were you feeding it again?"," **Interviewee**: Because it is the only reason, I can think of as a reason that made it fail. As far as feeding it, I was feeding it with 6 buckets of manure and 5 buckets of water every three or four days."
24,2022-07-26,109, **Interviewer**: We are remaining with 5 questions or so. How much did the reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I cannot know. I can only remember that a lot of people we are coming in big cars -- and we simply accepted it and did not follow the other things."
24,2022-07-26,110, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: No. Nothing!
24,2022-07-26,111, **Interviewer**: You told me bricks.," **Interviewee**: Oh, yeah, bricks, and the people I paid to build the wall around it."
24,2022-07-26,112," **Interviewer**: Apart from that, what else?", **Interviewee**: That is all.
24,2022-07-26,113, **Interviewer**: How many people were there involved in digging?, **Interviewee**: It was my two boys and me.
24,2022-07-26,114, **Interviewer**: How many did masonry work?," **Interviewee**: It was two, and it took them two days."
24,2022-07-26,115, **Interviewer**: Did it help you to save money?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
24,2022-07-26,116," **Interviewer**: Approximately, how much do you feel you saved?"," **Interviewee**: I saved maybe K3000... I sell traditional whisky, so that's my source of income. So, the money I saved came from that business (laughs)."
24,2022-07-26,117, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you use the digester for Kachasu (African traditional whisky) brewing?," **Interviewee**: No, That was for cooking nsima and side dish. And, that's where we could have benefited more. That's for cooking nsima and not Kachasu."
24,2022-07-26,118, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: Aah no, my brother, Kachasu is not easy to cook; Kachasu needs a lot of energy to boil."
24,2022-07-26,119, **Interviewer**: Maybe you are underestimating the digester. It produces strong flames.," **Interviewee**: But, not to the point of cooking hard meals, and certainly not Kachasu. Kachasu requires a lot of fire. We use two bundles of firewood to make Kachasu. So, if you tell me that the digester can boil water for bathing, I would agree, but not Kachasu."
24,2022-07-26,120, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) what was the biggest difference in your life when it was working?," **Interviewee**: The biggest change was that I was cooking without bothering about igniting fire. I was cooking like I was in town or somewhere, and I loved it. So, that was the biggest difference."
24,2022-07-26,121, **Interviewer**: You wish to live in town?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) who doesn't want to live in town. Is there a person who doesn't want good things (laughs)? That time it was like the town came to our village. Nankumba was like a town to us that time, for sure."
24,2022-07-26,122, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is good and it is my prayer that one day I will have it again. Moreover, I would like to be trained properly afterwards, so that I could manage it properly -- that's all I want. I still think about it, and I wonder how we missed that opportunity, and how it didn't work. Nevertheless, throughout this time, \[name redacted\] has always been encouraging me; he comes repeatedly, and he is always telling me not to lose hope because the installer one day would come."
24,2022-07-26,123, ## **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi? Is the future bright or dim? Where do you see it five years?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it has a bright future. I didn't know about it, but some people gave me. We have people who want others to have it, so it will spread in the end."
24,2022-07-26,124," **Interviewer**: You were given one, and someone in this village was given one. But, not even one is working today. Do you think it's manageable?"," **Interviewee**: It would be improper for me to say it can\'t work because I didn't stay with it for long. So, I don't really know it well, and I also don't know what went wrong. Maybe, I did something wrong on it; maybe they didn't install it properly. So, I can't say it\`s unmanageable."
24,2022-07-26,125," **Interviewer**: Last question, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I would chose the same if I had cows. But now I don't have cow I can't manage it. Maybe I can be sourcing it from other people, but like I have said everything is about money these day. Imagine if people would sell broken bricks, what more manure. So, if there can be a technology that can be used without using money regularly I would go for that."
24,2022-07-26,126," **Interviewer**: Okay, do you have any last words?"," **Interviewee**: Biogas is a good thing to have. And I'm a very lucky person to have been given one. I never expected it come to me. In this village, we are too many, and to be a beneficiary is luck. The world is changing; the world is not like it was some years back, so we need this kind of thing to replace traditional methods of cooking. -- Yeah, I was excited that I got a Biogas."
24,2022-07-26,127, **Interviewer**: Thanks for the interview.,NA
25,2022-07-27,1,Where did this digester originate from?, **Interviewee**: I have forgotten.
25,2022-07-27,2," **Interviewer**: During you encounter with them, Where did they say the digester originate from?"," **Interviewee**: I think they said India, if not China. It was China, I guess."
25,2022-07-27,3, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: I think it was from China. Or, maybe some non-governmental organization."
25,2022-07-27,4, **Interviewer**: Who built it and when was it built?, **Interviewee**: I have forgotten the date!
25,2022-07-27,5, **Interviewer**: Or just the year., **Interviewee**: I still need to be reminded.
25,2022-07-27,6," **Interviewer**: Who was the president back then? Was it Bingu? Was it Peter? Or, Joyce? \[list of former presidents\]", **Interviewee**: I think it was 2017.
25,2022-07-27,7, **Interviewer**: I think you are right. I think it was 2016 or 2017., **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
25,2022-07-27,8, **Interviewer**: How long does it take to build?, **Interviewee**: Digging and lining the hole took a day. I did that together with my family.
25,2022-07-27,9, **Interviewer**: How many were you that time?," **Interviewee**: I had five children. I total we were seven including my husband. My children were helping my husband by collecting water while he was building the wall around it. So, that was how it was."
25,2022-07-27,10, **Interviewer**: Is your husband a builder by profession?," **Interviewee**: Yes, he is."
25,2022-07-27,11," **Interviewer**: Apart from that, was there anything else you did?", **Interviewee**: Before they came to install it that was what we did.
25,2022-07-27,12," **Interviewer**: On the day of installation, what did you do?"," **Interviewee**: On the day of installation, we collected cow manure and prepared the feedstock -- and it was hard work."
25,2022-07-27,13, **Interviewer**: How many bags of cow manure and water did you work with that day?," **Interviewee**: I have forgotten how much cow manure we used. Oh, it\`s been a long. But, it was a lot of cow manure. I think it was 6 bags of cow manure and 6 drums of water."
25,2022-07-27,14, **Interviewer**: How were you as selected as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: We got it because my husband was mostly working with the agriculture department on various programs. For example, he was heavily involved in irrigation, so he was always in touch with the agriculture department. So, when the digester came through the agriculture department he was requested to be a beneficiary."
25,2022-07-27,15, **Interviewer**: So beyond that why were you chosen as beneficiaries?," **Interviewee**: Our hard work! So, they knew we would embrace the project, and do the work as required."
25,2022-07-27,16, **Interviewer**: Some say were chosen because we had cows. Did you have cows?," **Interviewee**: No, we did not have cows."
25,2022-07-27,17," **Interviewer**: So, where were you getting cow manure?", **Interviewee**: We were asking from the people who had cows.
25,2022-07-27,18, **Interviewer**: How was it like going to people's houses to ask for cow manure for the digester?," **Interviewee**: It was not hard because many people have a lot of cows here. And, people who have cows like it because it more like you are doing a service of removing cow manure from their cow house."
25,2022-07-27,19, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: We learnt about biogas when the installers came and explained about biogas. So, we were like, ""oh okay, is it possible?"" and they were like ""yes"". So, we were like bring it on."
25,2022-07-27,20, **Interviewer**: What did they say about biogas that time?," **Interviewee**: When they came, they told us that we would be able to cook using cow manure without any issues.....They said that cow manure would be our new firewood. They also mentioned that we would start using cow manure for cooking and eventually we would stop going to the forest to look for firewood."
25,2022-07-27,21," **Interviewer**: So, how was the selection process like?"," **Interviewee**: I think there was something the project implementers especially the agriculture office looked in people. Therefore, I feel like they weighed the people to see who was capable to manage it. I do not think were just giving the digesters to any person. Moreover, the digesters came as part of a pilot project to see if they could work, so I do not think they could just give to any person."
25,2022-07-27,22, **Interviewer**: Thanks for the puffs. Let us eat Ma'am. What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: Thanks for the puffs. We expected to stop going around searching for firewood for cooking. So, we were so happy about it, and embraced the digesters wholeheartedly."
25,2022-07-27,23," **Interviewer**: So, basically, you expected to cook without firewood?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
25,2022-07-27,24," **Interviewer**: Aside from that, what else did you expect?", **Interviewee**: We were just happy with the idea of cooking without going to the forest to look for firewood.
25,2022-07-27,25, **Interviewer**: Did you think about the prospect of using it as a source of fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Yes, we did. We were getting the slurry, which was coming out of the digester to the farm. So, it was helping us in terms of agriculture. I had a garden close to the digester, which I was using the digestate as fertilizer. Some people were not using the digestate, but some we were not."
25,2022-07-27,26, **Interviewer**: Why were some not using the digestate?," **Interviewee**: Some did not dig a hole, but a drain so it was simply flowing -- maybe they did not find it useful as they had other means of finding fertilizer."
25,2022-07-27,27, **Interviewer**: How did you collect the digestate?," **Interviewee**: The maize was healthy, the yield was dumper, and we were not buying fertilizer. We were fully dependent on the digestate."
25,2022-07-27,28, **Interviewer**: Which fertilizer were you using before this?, **Interviewee**: We were buying inorganic fertilizer from Agora Shops.
25,2022-07-27,29, **Interviewer**: How many bags were sufficient for your needs?," **Interviewee**: I was simply buying in small quantities because I did not have the money to buy a bag or in bulks. So, I was buying 10 kgs of fertilizer at one point. Then, I would find that was not sufficient, so I was buying another 10kgs. So, it was always like that."
25,2022-07-27,30, **Interviewer**: How much fertilizer were you using at the end of all that?," **Interviewee**: In one growing season, we used probably 100 kg of fertilizer and that\`s 2 bags of 50 kg fertilizer; one for quick growth of maize, and the other for strong maize kernels."
25,2022-07-27,31, **Interviewer**: How much was a bag of fertilizer then?, **Interviewee**: It was K20000.
25,2022-07-27,32, **Interviewer**: Now?, **Interviewee**: It's K60000 or K70000
25,2022-07-27,33, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the digestate collection point at the outlet?," **Interviewee**: We dug a hole and digestate was flowing into the hole. So, we were collecting digestate from the hole."
25,2022-07-27,34," **Interviewer**: Was the digestate not sipping into the ground? I mean, did not you lose some of the digestate by that collection system?"," **Interviewee**: We were getting the digestate straight to the farm, as it was plenty. Of course, some was lost in the way. Some was lost in the ground. So, we had challenge of collecting and containing it."
25,2022-07-27,35," **Interviewer**: Why did you buy a big bucket and place it there? Or, why didn't you line the hole for the collection of digestate?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs heavily) yeah, but I did not use it for long, because it did not last long. I only used it for one growing season. It did not last a year. So, I do not know if my colleagues used it for long, but as for me, I did not use it for more than a year. The pipes got broken, so it did not produce gas any more... And, the digester was made to produce digestate when it was producing gas. But, if there was no gas production, no digestate was produced.... So, I used it for a very short time. I think, I used it for 6 months."
25,2022-07-27,36, **Interviewer**: What often did it release digestate and under what circumstances?," **Interviewee**: I do not know how often but after sometime digester just was producing digestate with a loud sound, if the sun was hot. When it was cloudy, the digester would not produce gas -- it did not work. Also, it was only working after 9 AM to 2 PM. It was working without the sun, so after 2 PM it was not working."
25,2022-07-27,37," **Interviewer**: Okay, what kind of training did you receive?", **Interviewee**: We didn\'t have any training.
25,2022-07-27,38," **Interviewer**: Then, how were you able to switch it on and off?"," **Interviewee**: The installer simply told what to do. But, we did not receive training."
25,2022-07-27,39, **Interviewer**: What were you told by the installers? What did they say?, **Interviewee**: They told us how to turn it on and off.
25,2022-07-27,40," **Interviewer**: So, then say they told you how to switch it on. Okay, what else?"," Interviewee: What else? That was that, because that meant that we would now cook. So, yeah, they showed us the button for switching the burners on and off."
25,2022-07-27,41, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you anything about maintenance?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't and that\'s why it didn\'t last long. And, that's why when it malfunctioned we did not know what to do to fix it."
25,2022-07-27,42, **Interviewer**: How prepared did you feel prepared were to run it?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we were very much prepared. And, that\`s why we were able to use it whenever there was sunlight"
25,2022-07-27,43, **Interviewer**: You had the right to deny the digester. Why did you choose to accept it?," **Interviewee**: Yes, indeed, it was possible to say no. And, when you think of the work that is involved, one would easily say no. I mean, we used to feed it with five buckets of cow manure, if I'm not mistaken. To that, we added water, so it was really a tiresome job."
25,2022-07-27,44," **Interviewer**: Then, why did you accept it?"," **Interviewee**: ... and the manure was flesh, not dry (laughs heavily) - fresh manure! But, we accepted it and persevered, And, I was also handling the manure with bare hands. So, it was tough, and I only accepted it because we wanted to cook without going around looking for firewood."
25,2022-07-27,45, **Interviewer**: Is firewood hard to find here?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, very much. It is very hard to find firewood in this part."
25,2022-07-27,46, **Interviewer**: Where do you get wood?, **Interviewee**: It is very far from here - from the mountains.
25,2022-07-27,47," **Interviewer**: So, how did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? So, where you only using wood or you were also buying charcoal?", **Interviewee**: I was only using firewood.
25,2022-07-27,48, **Interviewer**: Like how much firewood?," **Interviewee**: We collect wood in bundles. So, we used the bundles in three days."
25,2022-07-27,49," **Interviewer**: In a week, how many days were you going to the mountain to search for firewood?", **Interviewee**: Two times in a week.
25,2022-07-27,50," **Interviewer**: Like if you go on Monday, you were using the wood from Monday through Wednesday. And, maybe go again on Thursday, and use the wood from Thursday to Sunday. That is some job.", **Interviewee**: That some hard work indeed.
25,2022-07-27,51, **Interviewer**: How did you differentiate cooking on biogas with cooking on firewood?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is fast. With firewood, you need to find grasses first to help start the fire. So, it\`s difficult to start up. So, biogas is fast because you simply need a matchstick to light up light up the burners... So, biogas is faster than firewood."
25,2022-07-27,52, **Interviewer**: So it was faster because it did not involve so many processes or even because the flame itself was stronger?," **Interviewee**: The process is faster. The flame itself is stronger than that of firewood. But, if you put enough food, firewood produces stronger flames than biogas. Also, the flame of biogas was dependent on the sun. If the sun was minimal, the gas was less and the flame itself was not strong. But, at noon especially in October \[summer\], the flame was just strong."
25,2022-07-27,53, **Interviewer**: In June \[wet season\]?," **Interviewee**: Ah, we could not even cook in June."
25,2022-07-27,54," **Interviewer**: Oh, really?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, if the sun was like this \[humid and a little bit sunny\], we would not cook. It could not even start."
25,2022-07-27,55," **Interviewer**: But, it is not cold."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we would not cook even when it was like this. It needed to be hot to get the flame"
25,2022-07-27,56," **Interviewer**: Oh, it is tough"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and that is when the idea of putting a bag of sand or stones on top of the digester came. So, we used to put a load on top of the digester bag to help push the gas to the stove."
25,2022-07-27,57, **Interviewer**: How did you learn that?, **Interviewee**: We just thought that on our own.
25,2022-07-27,58," **Interviewer**: You said you were getting manure from other people. Before the digester, were you also doing the same?"," **Interviewee**: No, for what?"
25,2022-07-27,59, **Interviewer**: Maybe for fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Oh, yes, we did. We were using cow manure as fertilizer for our crops and vegetable garden."
25,2022-07-27,60, **Interviewer**: But you told me you were using organic fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: We were mixing \[cow manure and inorganic fertilizer\]. Sometimes, we were only using manure extension workers told us to use. They told us that we could make strong fertilizer from cow manure by adding maize grain, yeast and 5 kgs of inorganic fertilizer."
25,2022-07-27,61, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you start it with?,I believe it was 6 bags of 50 kg of cow manure.
25,2022-07-27,62, **Interviewer**: Water?, **Interviewee**: I think it was 6 drums of water.
25,2022-07-27,63, **Interviewer**: Where did you get it?, **Interviewee**: We got it from the lake. It is there.
25,2022-07-27,64," **Interviewer**: Oh, less than 150 meters. How long did it take to start up?"," **Interviewee**: Our digester bag got fully inflated on the 3^rd^ day, and on the 4^th^ day we started using it. The installers came in their cars and moved from one beneficiary to another to commission the digesters."
25,2022-07-27,65," **Interviewer**: How much gas did it produce? How much cooking time did you? Were you able to prepare breakfast, lunch and supper after commissioning?"," **Interviewee**: We could not cook breakfast in the morning. We used to cook after 9:00 o'clock when the sun was out. So we were basically cooking from noon to 2:00 PM. Thus, we could not cook in the morning and in the evening."
25,2022-07-27,66, **Interviewer**: So you were getting cooking time sufficient for cooking lunch only?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we were only getting gas enough for cooking nsima and side dish as well as for boiling bathing water \[approximately one hour\]."
25,2022-07-27,67, **Interviewer**: And only if there was sunlight?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, when the weather was like this, it would not even start."
25,2022-07-27,68, **Interviewer**: How did you use the gas? Did you use it for cooking only?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was only for cooking."
25,2022-07-27,69, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: First, you need to dig a hole and line it to prevent soil from collapsing into the bag. Then, you need cow manure and water -- That was it."
25,2022-07-27,70, **Interviewer**: What were you doing with the cow manure and water?," **Interviewee**: We were mixing cow menu with water using hands. Then, we used to pour the feedstock into the digester bag in one of the two white pipes. And, the pipe where the feedstock was not poured into, is where the digestate was coming out from"
25,2022-07-27,71, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about all that?," **Interviewee**: We accepted with the digester, so could not have done otherwise. We did not feel disgusted because we accepted the whole process when we accepted the digester. Also, the installers were the first to mix the feedstock using bare hands, when they were teaching us how to make feedstock. So, that is also we were doing ourselves.."
25,2022-07-27,72, **Interviewer**: (laughs) If the visitors were doing that....., **Interviewee**: (laughs).... What could we have done?
25,2022-07-27,73," **Interviewer**: (Laughs) how often did you feed it? And, in what quantities?", **Interviewee**: We were feeding it with four buckets (20 liters) of cow manure every day.
25,2022-07-27,74, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: My family was responsible; I was my children, husband, and I."
25,2022-07-27,75, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: They told us to take good care of it; they said we should ensure that children are not playing around it. And, they said we should be alert and aware of the surrounding."
25,2022-07-27,76, **Interviewer**: How were you supposed to take care good of it? Could you please elaborate on that?," **Interviewee**: Like to look after the pipes. If a pipe was bent or wound, we used to straighten them up. Also, check for loose connections in the connections, and generally monitor the pipe that over the ground."
25,2022-07-27,77, **Interviewer**: So children were not supposed to come near it?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
25,2022-07-27,78, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: I order to prevent them from cutting the pipes with razor blades or something, and even from disconnecting the pipes."
25,2022-07-27,79, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for maintenance?, **Interviewee**: It was the installers. But they did not say we should be calling them if there was a problem with the digester.
25,2022-07-27,80, **Interviewer**: Did they give you their numbers?," **Interviewee**: Yes, they did. But they did not tell us that we could call them when there was a problem - They did not say anything like that, and that is why we abandoned it after it malfunctioned."
25,2022-07-27,81," **Interviewer**: Is it wrong to say, it didn't meet your needs because you could not cook on it all the times?"," **Interviewee**: You are not wrong at all, because I was only able to cook on it at lunchtime, and I was still cooking using firewood to meet my cooking needs."
25,2022-07-27,82," **Interviewer**: You said you were getting firewood from the mountains, are you still sourcing firewood from the mountain."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I still go there twice a week to get firewood."
25,2022-07-27,83, **Interviewer**: How many times were you going there to get firewood when the digester was working?," **Interviewee**: That time the digester was helping us. We could not go twice there as now. We were probably going there once a week, because the digester was supplementing the cooking time we were getting from firewood. Thus, we were only using firewood in the morning and at evening."
25,2022-07-27,84, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: It is mostly what I have already talked about; it was not giving us enough gas to cook for a long time. Moreover, it was not producing strong fire at times. It was taking a lot of effort to make feedstock, but it was only producing small cooking time -- that was a problem -- it did not meet our needs."
25,2022-07-27,85, **Interviewer**: How was the fire going off?," **Interviewee**: It was gradually going off, and eventually it was going off completely."
25,2022-07-27,86, **Interviewer**: Was there are leakage?," **Interviewee**: No, there was no leakage. But at the end, it developed a leak at the joint between the digester bag and pipe \[gas connector\]. So, we tried to bond the gas connector with glue, but it did not help, and that was the end of it. Because after that, when the bag was full, some of the gas was escaping and little gas was coming to the stove. Thus, we could not even cook at all."
25,2022-07-27,87, **Interviewer**: How did you know that it was the gas connector? How did it manifest?," **Interviewee**: We did troubleshoot, when we saw that the bag was full and gas was not coming to the stove. So, we found out that gas was escaping at the joint."
25,2022-07-27,88, **Interviewer**: How did you troubleshoot?," **Interviewee**: When saw that the bag was full, but gas was not coming to the stove, we were very surprised. Then, we tried to find the problem. So, we moved our ears on and around gas connector and the pipes. Then, we heard a gas leaking sound at the gas connector."
25,2022-07-27,89, **Interviewer**: (laughs) that was funny. How long did it work before it stopped working?," **Interviewee**: We used it for six months. After that leak at the gas connector, it did not work again because of a separation at that gas connector"
25,2022-07-27,90, **Interviewer**: Did you call installers?, **Interviewee**: I think we called them and reported that gas was leaking at the gas connector. They just said okay and that they would see what they could do - that was it.
25,2022-07-27,91, **Interviewer**: Did they come?, **Interviewee**: They never came. They never came to see the problem.
25,2022-07-27,92, **Interviewer**: Have you ever seen something like this \[table of intervention\]? What do you think of information and do you think it would have helped?," **Interviewee**: If they had given us this and told us where to find the materials, it would have helped. Therefore, with this we would have known what to do, if they had told us where to get the spare parts to fix the problem. It\`s sad they just give us the digester without necessary information, so when it malfunctioned that was the end of it."
25,2022-07-27,93, **Interviewer**: So if they had given this to you we would have been talking a different story or even eating nsima cooked on the digester?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) Yeah, You would have eaten nsima with bonya \[very small fish popular in the markets\] today"
25,2022-07-27,94," **Interviewer**: If the installers call to ask about the digester, what would you say? I mean, how would you describe the current state of your digester?", **Interviewee**: It got broken long ago. I would say I don't have a digester.
25,2022-07-27,95, **Interviewer**: Do you still have the equipment?," **Interviewee**: I still have a broken stove. I have the pipes, which I am using as a clothesline."
25,2022-07-27,96," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, what caused it to fail?"," **Interviewee**: It\`s because gas connector had a problem, as it couldn't get a tight grip of digester bag. As a result, gas started to leak. And, once digester starts leaking gas at the gas connector, you should expect anything good to come out of it, because gas is what makes a digester produce gas at the burners, and it\`s hard to fix. So, after that, we could have done nothing, and it died."
25,2022-07-27,97," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, what was the major issue? Was it the fact that we did not come when there was a problem or the problem itself was big that it could not have managed to fix?"," **Interviewee**: The main issue is that the installers did not help us. They should have given us spare part. Even a car has spare parts so that when it has a break down the parts that have malfunctioned should be replaced. Thus, if you given something without spare parts do not expect it to last, because once there is a problem you cannot remedy it, and eventually it dies."
25,2022-07-27,98, **Interviewer**: How to meet your energy needs now that is not working? You said you use firewood?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
25,2022-07-27,99, **Interviewer**: What challenges do you meet there?," **Interviewee**: Thorns prickle us because trees we use for firewood here are thorny, so our hands get bloody sometimes. Snakes even bite us too."
25,2022-07-27,100," **Interviewer**: Oh, sorry", **Interviewee**: Wasps even bite us.
25,2022-07-27,101, **Interviewer**: That\`s very tough. We are going towards the end of our interview. We have like 10% left. How much did the digester cost?," **Interviewee**: They did mention the cost, but I have forgotten what they said. It was a lot though."
25,2022-07-27,102, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: We provided bricks, cow manure, and water."
25,2022-07-27,103, **Interviewer**: How many bricks?," **Interviewee**: I have forgotten, but I think it was close to 500."
25,2022-07-27,104, **Interviewer**: How much did it cost you?,"Mmh, I cannot remember. However, I think in total, if all the labor and materials are accounted for, I think I spent more than K100000 in 6 months. That is considering the work of collecting water and manure. I think, if I had hired someone to do that, he could have charged me K25000 per month because that was a lot of work."
25,2022-07-27,105, **Interviewer**: How did the digging?, **Interviewee**: It was my husband together with my two boys. The rest of us were simply collecting water.
25,2022-07-27,106, **Interviewer**: He did the masonry as well?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
25,2022-07-27,107," **Interviewer**: Is there anything else that had to be imported from another country? When you look at digester, do you think it is from Malawi?"," **Interviewee**: I think, it is not for Malawi."
25,2022-07-27,108, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: The installers said it was from outside the country. And, even its appearance itself can tell that it is not from Malawi."
25,2022-07-27,109, **Interviewer**: How did it look?, **Interviewee**: Its design and appearance looked like nothing I had seen before. It was my first time to see it.
25,2022-07-27,110, **Interviewer**: What was the biggest difference in your life the time you had biogas?," **Interviewee**: There was a difference because I was free and happy. In addition, most people were coming to admire it as well, and they liked it when they saw you just switch it on with a button to get fire."
25,2022-07-27,111," **Interviewer**: Oh, many people showed interest?"," **Interviewee**: They admired it a lot and wondered how they could own one someday. Then, I was telling them that one day their dream would become reality as this was only a demo. Therefore, if they continue showing interest then the installers were going to be motivated to bring more."
25,2022-07-27,112, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I desire to have biogas again. But, next time they need to make adjustments to the digester itself?"
25,2022-07-27,113, **Interviewer**: Why and how?," **Interviewee**: The good thing is that it was taking the burden away from us; with 4 buckets of cow manure and water, I was able to cook. However, they need to address the issue concerning sunlight, because like I said without sunlight I wouldn't cook. It's very imperative that they solve this issue. Imagine, it was impossible for us to cook porridge for school going kids. It was even difficult to warm bathing water for the kids before they left for school, if there was not sunlight or early in the morning."
25,2022-07-27,114, **Interviewer**: What technological modifications would you think of?," **Interviewee**: Maybe, if they can shift it to electric power before it is hard for people like us to go asking for manure all the times. If the can make it like solar, then we would appreciate it even more."
25,2022-07-27,115, **Interviewer**: What are the pros and cons of biogas?," **Interviewee**: With biogas, you cook with ease. Moreover, it is easy to start the fire with matchstick. Its cons are; it is tiresome, as it needs daily feeding; you cannot do the work when you sick because it is intense. You need to be healthy to prepare the feedstock. Unlike solar, you just take the panel to the sun, and then you are safe."
25,2022-07-27,116," **Interviewer**: Okay, I get it. What is the future of biogas in Malawi?", **Interviewee**: It is bright and it can really help us to conserve the environment because it stops people from going to the forest to get wood.
25,2022-07-27,117,Do you think you are in a position to say that the future is bright when you were given one and now it is dead?," **Interviewee**: Good. With the research you are doing, you need to come up with ways of making it better, so that it can become durable and efficient, and help people better next time; do not stop the project here, keep it going."
25,2022-07-27,118," **Interviewer**: Do you think if we can give 10 digesters to 10 people, or if we can give you another digester, do you think in five or ten years it can still be working?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, it may be possible. On our part, we can be more than willing to get one again. And we can take good care of it. And you can even see that we still have materials for the last digester. But, you may need to tell us where to find the spare parts for it, so that we can fix it on our own once it malfunctions. Or, you can simply give us contacts of people who fix it too, so that we can call them once it malfunctions. We failed on this because there was no one to fix it for us. They simply abandoned the digester to us."
25,2022-07-27,119, **Interviewer**: You give an example of a car. You said to maintain a car you need the spare parts. Spare parts are not free; can you be willing to pay for spare parts instead of going to the mountains to get firewood free?," **Interviewee**: Here people are very business oriented. So, what we can be doing is sell thobwa (traditional sweet beer) and save some of the money. It is the same like electricity, to keep it running you need a business to pay the bills."
25,2022-07-27,120, **Interviewer**: Can you pay K15000 to fix your digester?," **Interviewee**: No, I cannot. But, it can depend on other situations as well. If I can see that it is helping my family and it is contributing to my business, then I can. If I can see that I have stopped going to the forest to get firewood completely, then I can sacrifice money to fix it. To own something valuable you need to make sacrifices. It is like having a baby. When you have a baby, you are obliged to save money in case of an emergency."
25,2022-07-27,121, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) so should we say you have money safer?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) yeah, I do have. I have kids, so it is only necessary. I keep money in a safer. You cannot be going around asking for money from neighbors while your child is dying and in need of urgent medical support."
25,2022-07-27,122," **Interviewer**: (laughs) true. Last one, though I feel like you have kind of answered it already. My next and last question is, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead of biogas?", **Interviewee**: I would have chosen solar instead of biogas.
25,2022-07-27,123, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: With solar you do not need to go to a neighbor to ask for cow manure. You only needed to take out the solar panels to the roof, and with it, you can also use it for lighting."
25,2022-07-27,124, **Interviewer**: Thanks. That was my last question. Do you have anything to say?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is very helpful. It makes you feel proud and it gives you peace. And when we had it we stopped going to the forest. Maybe, we were going just once instead of twice. It is very handy."
25,2022-07-27,125," **Interviewer**: When you say, you felt proud, what do mean?"," **Interviewee**: It makes you feel like you have electricity in your house. A person who has a house connected to electricity is a happy person, because when he wants to cook, he only hit the switch. You do not get dirty; you do not get cough or flu because of the smoke. Biogas does not produce smoke; when you are cooking, you are peace; it does not blacked pots -- so it is a joy to have it!"
25,2022-07-27,126, **Interviewer**: That's the end of our interview. I thank you for your time.,NA
26,2022-07-27,1, **Interviewer**: Where did this digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: Mmh (laughs) I am trying to recall the name, but it is not coming to my head... It's been long, so I've forgotten the name. All I can remember is that it came through the agriculture office under a project, which was aimed at conserving and protecting the environment. So, to be honest with you, I have forgotten exactly who brought it here because it's been a while."
26,2022-07-27,2," **Interviewer**: So, I presume the same people also funded it. Or, do you know who funded it?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it must be the same people."
26,2022-07-27,3," **Interviewer**: Do you remember when it was built, and who built it?"," **Interviewee**: I think it was late 2016, if not 2017. I am saying this because I was also involved in a stove-making project around the same time."
26,2022-07-27,4, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to build it?," **Interviewee**: At first, they came to explain about the project. After that, they went to people who had cows to see if they were interested in owning a biogas digester. Then, they said they were going to come back, and indeed, after three weeks they came. After a week, they brought the digester. Therefore, to make the long story short, they taught us about stove making and biogas. And, it took a month from the first time they came to the point they brought the digester."
26,2022-07-27,5, **Interviewer**: What was your role?," **Interviewee**: My first role was to take part in the free training. My second role was to provide cow manure from my cow house. To this, I added water to make feedstock that I did myself. I also brought bricks that were not used though. I also dug a hole for the digester bag."
26,2022-07-27,6, **Interviewer**: Who did the digging? Was it only you?, **Interviewee**: I hired one person to dig the hole.
26,2022-07-27,7, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay?, **Interviewee**: I paid for K3500 for that. I also paid K5000 for the bricks.
26,2022-07-27,8," **Interviewer**: Were you told that the work was going to need bricks? And, how come you did not use the bricks?"," **Interviewee**: Good one. There was a problem because different people were coming on different days. When the individual who trained us on stove making and biogas came, he told us to dig a hole and to buy bricks and sand. We did that, and we asked him about cement. He told me that they would provide cement, and that they were going to bring two bags of cement. After that individual went, another individual came. When he came, he just came with a plastic digester bag and other equipment like pipes, stoves and stuff. Then, I inquired about cement, because they told me before installing the digester bag that they were going to line the hole with a brick wall. Then, he just responded that he was not gives, so because it was a different person I did bother to ask more questions."
26,2022-07-27,9," **Interviewer**: (Laughs) did he take the cement for himself, or what?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) I do not know. But, that was the response I was given."
26,2022-07-27,10," **Interviewer**: Okay, how were you selected as a beneficiary? I mean, we have so many people in this community, how did it happen that it came to \[name redacted\] house?"," **Interviewee**: It wasn't as if they came straight to me to tell me that they were coming to install the digester here. But, they called people who had cows at the agriculture offices. Then they asked who was willing to accept the technology -- that was it. Then, I think four people accepted in the technology. But, I had a great chance of getting one because around that time I was also involved in another project that was to do with the environment which was to do with construction of energy efficient stoves. So when the biogas project came, coupled with my previous experience in the environmental project, it was easy for me to accept it because it was basically aligned to the environment."
26,2022-07-27,11, **Interviewer**: How many people were called to the agriculture office?," **Interviewee**: I think it was seven to eight people -- I'm sure it was eight people... At that time, only eight people in this community had cows. And, some of the people who have cows now that time did not have cows. So, from the eight people, some gave excuses why they did not want to have a digester. Some said they did not like the process of making feedstock, as it was disgusting to them. Some said they had small fences so they had security concerns. Some said they did not have space to put the digester."
26,2022-07-27,12," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you know about biogas before?", **Interviewee**: Yes
26,2022-07-27,13, **Interviewer**: Do you mean you knew about biogas before you were called to the agriculture office as a cow farmer?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I had little knowledge about biogas. But, I learned more about biogas after the training. But, to say I knew about the biogas before the training I might be wrong -- I was only hearing about it."
26,2022-07-27,14, **Interviewer**: Where did you learn or hear about this?, **Interviewee**: I heard about it at Mtakataka primary school during training about the environment.
26,2022-07-27,15, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: I expected to cook with ease because it is similar to cooking on an electric stove. So, in that regard I expected change. I also expected to stop using charcoal or firewood because I was getting equipment that uses renewable energy for cooking."
26,2022-07-27,16,What did the installers told you to expect from this?," **Interviewee**: They told us that the digester produces gas that moves in pipes to the stove for cooking. They also told us during the training that it produces more gas when there is sunlight unlike when there is no sunrise or in cold season. On this notion, I suggested that they should make storage bags or anything for collecting and storing gas during sunlight to be used in cold times or when there is no sun. Then, they said they were going to look into it, yeah."
26,2022-07-27,17," **Interviewer**: Oh, that was a brilliant idea. I mean, that is what most people do. Some people do have storage bags or tanks for storing gas to use at later. So, yeah, that was brilliant. Did they say they didn't have the storage bags or they didn\'t know about that?"," **Interviewee**: Personally, I would expect someone learned like you to know more than a person from the village like me.....And, during the training, I bombarded them with questions. But to say I knew if they had the storage bags or not, then that's not true.... Nonetheless, that is what I suggested."
26,2022-07-27,18," **Interviewer**: Okay, what questions did you bombard them with?"," **Interviewee**: The first question was about its protection. As you can see, this area is full of sand so with the way the hole was made chances were high that soil was going to collapsing into the pit and cover it up. Therefore, I thought that was a deficit. Secondly, I do not know if it was in Kenya or Ghana, they placed the digester under a shade like structure, I do not know if it was there to protect the bag from rain or something. Also from the tank to the kitchen, they made a draining system of which we did not see here. Also, I suggested that the pipes should be placed or enclosed in another plastic pipe to protect it from kids who stomp over the pipes. It is better to step on the enclosed pipes rather than stomping over the pipes directly. This way it would have protected the joints from disconnecting or anything else. So, that were some of the issues I had to ask them. Also in the kitchen, I suggested that they should clip the pipes to the wall with cable clips. Yeah, yeah."
26,2022-07-27,19, **Interviewer**: Just like they do with a cable from a satellite to the decoder at a sitting room?," **Interviewee**: ummh, right! yeah, as an essential means of managing and organizing pipe, and for securing the pipe to fixed points on a wall."
26,2022-07-27,20," **Interviewer**: When you brought the questions, did they answer you? If they did, were you satisfied with their answers?"," **Interviewee**: It was like a facilitation training. When I asked a question, I was asked questions like you are asking me by them to figure the answer by myself\...\... Some people, I do not think it was your group though, came in June to ask me questions as well regarding biogas. I must say a number of people have come here to ask me questions regarding biogas for research, I do not know."
26,2022-07-27,21," **Interviewer**: Oh, you have received a lot visitors?"," **Interviewee**: A lot of people, I think the first ones were auditors who were trying to establish if the digesters were indeed installed. Some other people came as well, and they did ask me how much the digester cost and all that. So, I told them the amount I was told."
26,2022-07-27,22, **Interviewer**: What were you told was the cost of the digester?," **Interviewee**: They said the cost of the digester was K200000 that time\... Then, they inquired if everything was available. Then, I just got all the materials out for them to see what materials I had."
26,2022-07-27,23," **Interviewer**: Eh, people have bothered by people to answer questions regarding biogas, uh?"," **Interviewee**: Not that, no. You come to do research to make things better. When you see there is a problem, you investigate, and then provide solutions. That is good."
26,2022-07-27,24," **Interviewer**: Yeah, that is true. It is like that. What type of training you receive?"," **Interviewee**: I will tell you point-blank, we did not receive any training regarding biogas. I was only trained on efficient stove making by the forestry department. But, during the training, something about biogas came up. And, they even said that biogas was just an supplementary topic. They gave an example, I think on biogas. So, it was just an supplementary topic. They were simply giving examples of cooking technologies that can be used to protect the environment."
26,2022-07-27,25, **Interviewer**: So the issue of biogas came up as you were discussing efficient stoves?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, yeah."
26,2022-07-27,26, **Interviewer**: What did they say about biogas?," **Interviewee**: They explained how biogas is produced. They discussed how long the process takes to produce gas. They also explained how to prepare the feedstock, and what things can be used as feedstock - they mentioned, for example, cow manure, chicken manure, pig manure and human manure. Then, I asked if it's possible to simply connect to the pipes to a pit latrine to produce gas (laughs heavily)"
26,2022-07-27,27, **Interviewer**: (laughs) what was their response to that?," **Interviewee**: They said it is possible, but not ordinary installers can do that because such type of digesters requires a lot skill."
26,2022-07-27,28," **Interviewer**: You have said the training or the information you got about biogas was just quick and not deep. Still, I would like to know, how prepared to run or operate the digester were you after that?"," **Interviewee**: The way they explained, it prepared us on how to prepare feedstock. It also gave us an opportunity to know which materials can be used in place of cow manure as feedstock which itself was very handy especially if there is a shortage of cow manure. Therefore, I can say it prepared us."
26,2022-07-27,29, **Interviewer**: How many people attended the training and how long was the training?," **Interviewee**: Out of the four people who were given the digesters here, only two of us attended the training. The other two did not attend the training because they were not part of the efficient stove-making project. And, thirty something people attended the whole training and only two of us from this area attended the training. The rest of the people were from different communities, and we were meeting at Mtakataka."
26,2022-07-27,30," **Interviewer**: It would be like I am asking you to repeating what you have already said, because I feel like you have touched on it but I still want to understand you very well. Why did you allow them to build the digester here? I mean, you had an opportunity to say, ""Thanks but I don't want that"", and you said some people you went to the agriculture office with said ""no"". Why did you accept it?"," **Interviewee**: Nice one. I like to learn new things. And, I feel it is not good to deny yourself an opportunity to learn new things. It\`s good to try out new things because you never know what it may bring. So, I think because of these two things it was easier for me to accept it. Also, they said this thing is for cooking. They did not say it was for decoration or it was some flower. So, I found it useful, and that's why I accepted it. And, I also knew it was going to make life easier for me. When I was making the decision, I also considered LPG gas stove because I have used it before, and thought they were somewhat similar, so I knew it was going to make me cook things faster."
26,2022-07-27,31, **Interviewer**: Did you like cooking on LPG?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I did."
26,2022-07-27,32, **Interviewer**: This takes to my next question. How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: I use a charcoal burner for cooking.
26,2022-07-27,33, **Interviewer**: What about LPG gas? How did you know about LPG gas?," **Interviewee**: Right now, I use charcoal, but previously I was using charcoal, LPG gas and electric stove. But, I abandoned both LPG and electric stoves because I found them expensive."
26,2022-07-27,34, **Interviewer**: How much LPG gas or charcoal or electric did you use?," **Interviewee**: I used two bags of charcoal. Sometimes, I use one and a three quarters bag of charcoal. It depends on my home availability of that particular month. As for LPG gas and electricity, I don't know how much LPG or electric I was using, as I was not following."
26,2022-07-27,35," **Interviewer**: Oh, sometimes you are never home?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, sometimes I\'m never home. Sometimes, I do not cook, you see."
26,2022-07-27,36, **Interviewer**: Are you a businessperson?," **Interviewee**: Eh, I'm someone who does a lot businesses (laughs)"
26,2022-07-27,37, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) do you buy charcoal?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I do. I do not make charcoal myself."
26,2022-07-27,38," **Interviewer**: Okay, how much is a bag of charcoal?", **Interviewee**: It's K7000 now.
26,2022-07-27,39, **Interviewer**: How much was it back then?," **Interviewee**: It was K3500, sometimes K3000."
26,2022-07-27,40, **Interviewer**: You said you had cows...," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and I still have. It is behind the house. Now, I have four cows. Back then, I had many cows, but many died during the rainy season. I think they ate something poisonous. So, some died and three were stolen."
26,2022-07-27,41, **Interviewer**: So that time you had like 10 cows?, **Interviewee**: We had more than 10 cows. We sold some too.
26,2022-07-27,42, **Interviewer**: How did you manage feedstock before the intervention?,"We move the manure to the farm. But, manure from biogas and cow house differs. Manure from the cow house is taken to the farm whilst it is dry. As for manure from a digester, it is used when it is fresh."
26,2022-07-27,43, **Interviewer**: Do you differentiate the two in terms of its strength?," **Interviewee**: No, it's just that you can't apply manure direct from the cow house because its heat wilts maize. While manure from a digester is processed in the reactor, so you can apply it directly to the crops. it\`s very sunny, you can take the feedstock to the farm on the very same day \... the digester takes out a lot of heat from cow manure. Cow manure contains a lot of heat, and you can even tell by the heat that comes out when preparing the feedstock."
26,2022-07-27,44, **Interviewer**: Did you use hands?," **Interviewee**: No. In this area, we have a mixer made of wood called Nkhafi. So, we used that one for making feedstock. So as we were making feedstock, we felt the heat when mixing the feedstock or when it spills on your skin."
26,2022-07-27,45," **Interviewer**: Okay. Moving on, how much feedstock did you feed it to start it up?"," **Interviewee**: The quantity of cow manure is equal to the quantity of water. If you use one drum of cow manure, you also use one drum of water. I think when we were starting it up, we used 3 drum, if not 5 drums (200 liters) of water. To this, we also used 3 or 5 drums (200 liters) of cow manure. It has been a long time, so I am not quite sure if it was 3 or 5 drums."
26,2022-07-27,46, **Interviewer**: So it's a one to one ratio. Where did you get cow manure and water?," **Interviewee**: I got the manure from my cow house. And, I got the water from the borehole."
26,2022-07-27,47, **Interviewer**: I can imagine it was some work; it is not easy to get 3 drums of water and 3 drums of manure.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, the good thing that time I had drums. So, I collected the water the day before they came, as I was informed of the day, which they were going to come and install the digester. So, they found everything ready. On that particular day, they were simply mixing cow manure and water in a bucket until they finished."
26,2022-07-27,48, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start?," **Interviewee**: It did not take a long time start. After it started, we were not feeding it every day. We used to feed it when we saw that the digester bag was somewhat deflated. And those times we were not feeding it as we did the first time. We were putting maybe one drum (200 liters) or four buckets (20 liters) of manure."
26,2022-07-27,49, **Interviewer**: How often were you feeding it?," **Interviewee**: In a month, we were feeding it once or twice."
26,2022-07-27,50," **Interviewer**: So in a month, you were feeding it once or twice with 1 drum of manure or 4 buckets of manure."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, once or twice."
26,2022-07-27,51," **Interviewer**: How much gas did it produce? Or, how much cooking time did you get? Were you able to cook breakfast, lunch and supper on it?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that's how it was. Here in the village we eat in the morning, at noon and in the evening. In other circumstances when we found food, we were cooking in between meals. Thus, in most cases, we were cooking up to 5 PM. At night, or after 5 pm, I was cooking using charcoal, because it was not producing fire after sunset."
26,2022-07-27,52, **Interviewer**: It was dependent on the sun?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that is why I said it could have been better if it had a gas storage. That way, we could have been cooking on it all the times."
26,2022-07-27,53, **Interviewer**: Were you able to cook beans and nsima?," **Interviewee**: I was able to cook beans, nsima without any problems."
26,2022-07-27,54," **Interviewer**: So, during the time it was working you were not strictly cooking using biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I was switching back and forth. I cannot lie to say I was only using biogas. Sometimes, I was cooking using charcoal. For example, if I had so many things to cook or if I had visitors. Therefore, I was cooking on biogas and charcoal as well, yeah."
26,2022-07-27,55, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding?," **Interviewee**: I was feeding it myself. I stay with a little boy, so he was helping me especially when I was not around. Sometimes, even when I was around he was helping."
26,2022-07-27,56," **Interviewer**: Okay, what's your take on the feeding task?", **Interviewee**: It was not tough.
26,2022-07-27,57," **Interviewer**: You mentioned that some people had issues feeding it, like some people were not comfortable touching and mixing cow manure. It was disgusting to them. Was there a point you felt like ""that was true"" and that this thing is disgusting or even tiresome?"," **Interviewee**: For something's, what matters is the result. Of course, some people may find it disgusting. As for me, I bought gloves. So, every time I was preparing feedstock I was wearing gloves and mask. So, I did not find it disgusting at all. I was just doing my job with no problem."
26,2022-07-27,58," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay, what were the maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: To maintain this, and if next time I am going to accept it, the hole around the digester bag must be lined first. After building brick wall around it, that is when I can be sure that this thing would be productive or helpful. Therefore, I think the wall needs to go above the hole, and if they can do that I might be willing to build a shade structure made of iron sheet or thatched grass on top of the digester bag to protect it from rain and other things. Secondly, they need to find a means of preventing gas moving directly from the digester bags to the stoves. Instead, gas should move first from the digester bags to a storage facility, and then to the stoves. That way the digester can work because it can work all day as gas could be stored. Thirdly, you give us numbers to call you whenever there is a problem. But, when we call, you do not come to fix the problems. You just say, ""We will come, we will come, we will come"" and the problem eventually escalates, you see; a problem that is minor, ends up being disastrous."
26,2022-07-27,59, **Interviewer**: What things were you told to do to maintain it?," **Interviewee**: They said sometimes because the pressure is high, gas leaks at the connection between the bag and pipe. Therefore, they told us do use glue and baking soda to seal any gas leakage."
26,2022-07-27,60," **Interviewer**: During its life, did you encounter this problem?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it happened once."
26,2022-07-27,61, **Interviewer**: Did you manage to fix it?," **Interviewee**: Yes, we fixed it ourselves, and it worked."
26,2022-07-27,62, **Interviewer**: How long did this take to happen?, **Interviewee**: It took after 7 months after it was installed.
26,2022-07-27,63, **Interviewer**: Did it meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it did."
26,2022-07-27,64," **Interviewer**: Then why were you using charcoal sometimes, instead of using biogas all the times?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, indeed we used charcoal sometimes. For example, when we had like 10 visitors and wanted to cook many things, we could not rely on biogas alone. Therefore, to do things quickly, I was using both charcoal and biogas. Besides that, there are times when the sun is on and off, so biogas tends to be on and off as well. Thus, there were times when we started cooking while the sun was shining and did not have problems. However, once the sun disappeared, it was going off as well. Therefore, to cope I was using charcoal for cooking as well."
26,2022-07-27,65, **Interviewer**: Didn't they tell you to put a sand of bag on top of the digester bag when pressure was low to boost the fire?," **Interviewee**: It did not mean less fire was not coming because there was no gas in the bag. But, I think it was sunlight at play in general. Like I said, when there is no sunlight, the bag cools as such it doesn't released enough gas because movement of gas is limited when it's cool regardless whether of quantity of the gas- yeah, so that's what I mean."
26,2022-07-27,66," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay, was there a time you did put a sand of bag or stones on top of the bag to get more fire at the stove?", **Interviewee**: No.
26,2022-07-27,67," **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. We have done 80%. Moving on, what were the challenges?"," **Interviewee**: It's what I have already said. Sometimes, it was going off while you were busy cooking."
26,2022-07-27,68," **Interviewer**: Okay, what else?"," **Interviewee**: Secondly, when there is a problem, and we call you people, you don\'t come."
26,2022-07-27,69, **Interviewer**: (laughs) don't say that!," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) I mean it, you do not come when there is problem."
26,2022-07-27,70," **Interviewer**: Why do you think ""we"" do not come when there is a problem?"," **Interviewee**: I even fail to understand that. Maybe, I should ask you why it is like that?"
26,2022-07-27,71," **Interviewer**: Try me, I will be there in an instant (Laughs). How did it stop? Did it stop at once? Or, it was gradually stopped?"," **Interviewee**: The digester stopped at once. I think it stopped during the rainy season. When we fed it, the bag was not inflating and it was not producing gas. Then, I thought it was not inflating because it was rainy season. Therefore, I decided to abandon it until the rains were over. So, in summer, I tried to feed it, but the bag didn't inflate. Then, I thought I had not put enough feedstock. I added more feedstock, but nothing happened."
26,2022-07-27,72, **Interviewer**: How was the connection between the bag and the pipe \[gas connector\]? Was it okay?," **Interviewee**: The joint was okay. It's just that after the rains the digester bag never got inflated. After I saw that the bag was not inflating I called the extension worker, \[name redacted\]. I even went to the agriculture district officers\` office in person to report the issue. I also called another extension worker for this area, \[name redacted\], who stays in Monkey bay. Mr. \[name redacted\] came and said he would report the issue to the relevant authorities. As for \[name redacted\], when I called him, he was just saying the installers were going to come. Then after some time, I gave up and stopped feeding it. I could not continue because I felt like I had put enough manure to get it started once again. Then, I just abandoned it."
26,2022-07-27,73, **Interviewer**: How long did it work before it stopped working?, **Interviewee**: It worked for two years.
26,2022-07-27,74," **Interviewer**: So after two years, it stopped completely and you abandoned it?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
26,2022-07-27,75," **Interviewer**: Suppose you were given something like this.... But, before that, have you seen something like this before?", **Interviewee**: No.
26,2022-07-27,76," **Interviewer**: This paper talks about issues common to digesters, possible causes, and their related solutions. What do you think of this type of information, and do you think it would have helped in your case?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, it could have helped me a lot because there are some problems that do not need an expert to solve. Of course, some things cannot be solved by an ordinary person, but needs an expert. Therefore, I think this information could have helped us to solve problems, which did not need an expert."
26,2022-07-27,77," **Interviewer**: Oh thanks. So you think if you were provided this information, you could have fixed your digester and still be working today?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it is possible that you would have found it working. You would not have found all the stones that are there."
26,2022-07-27,78, **Interviewer**: (laughs) how did the stones got to the top of the digester bag hole?," **Interviewee**: There was a funeral function, so after everything people thought it was easy to throw the stones on the hole of the digester."
26,2022-07-27,79," **Interviewer**: Okay, how would you describe the current state of the digester?"," **Interviewee**: I can say it is dead. I cannot say it is alive because it is not working. Yes, of course, I still have the equipment, but technically, I do not have a biogas digester. For example, I have the stove and some pipes, but they are not in a condition that they can work."
26,2022-07-27,80," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, what caused it to fail?"," **Interviewee**: As a leaner, it's going to be difficult for me to say what caused it to fail. But my observation is that when there was not sunlight the bag was deflating. So, when rainy season came, maybe it stayed long without working or producing gas. So, maybe that\'s why it never got inflated again - there was no sunlight. Therefore, I can simply say it stopped working because there was no sunlight."
26,2022-07-27,81," **Interviewer**: We have done over 80%. We have like 15% to wind up. Moving forward, you said now that it\'s not working you have gone back to charcoal, uh.", **Interviewee**: Yeah
26,2022-07-27,82, **Interviewer**: How do you manage feedstock now that it is not working?, **Interviewee**: We take the manure to the farm.
26,2022-07-27,83, **Interviewer**: Okay, **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
26,2022-07-27,84, **Interviewer**: How much manure do you make from your cows?, **Interviewee**: I do not really pay attention to that because neighbors also come to collect manure as well.
26,2022-07-27,85, **Interviewer**: Do you sell the manure or you give it for free?, **Interviewee**: We just give for free.
26,2022-07-27,86, **Interviewer**: Did you ever use the digestate as fertilizer for your crops?," **Interviewee**: Good, you have reminded me. The digester had two pipes; of which one was an outlet. The outlet was releasing slurry of ready processed manure. Personally, I feel like the installers' erred by not making drainage system or a digestate collection point. So, the digestate was initially just flowing anyhow. As for me, I just made a drainage to move the digestate away from the house. So I feel like that was not hygienic, and could have created problems like mosquitoes. Sometimes, we were even stepping in the digestate and that was not pleasant at all."
26,2022-07-27,87, **Interviewer**: How do you feel it was supposed to be made?," **Interviewee**: They should have dug a hole and placed a bucket in it. Or, they would have made a brick structure and cemented it with creed to contain the digestate."
26,2022-07-27,88, **Interviewer**: You never used the digestate because there was no structure like that?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I never used the digestate because there was no structure to collect it. So, it was just flowing anyhow."
26,2022-07-27,89, **Interviewer**: For two years?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
26,2022-07-27,90," **Interviewer**: oh, that was a missed opportunity. With the way fertilizer is expensive these days you could have saved some money with that. How much did the reactor cost? You said K200000?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was K200000. However, I do not know if the K200000 was only for the bag or for everything. They simply said, ""Do you know that the gift we are giving you is worthy K200000"". Therefore, I do not know if it was just the bag or everything."
26,2022-07-27,91, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind? I am thinking of the bricks...," **Interviewee**: Yeah - brick, sand, water and labor."
26,2022-07-27,92," **Interviewer**: And, it was one person who did the digging?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I personally didn't do the digging. I just hired one man to do that."
26,2022-07-27,93," **Interviewer**: Where did you get the bricks? Did you make them yourself? Or, you bought?"," **Interviewee**: Some people make bricks somewhere there. Therefore, I just bought from them."
26,2022-07-27,94, **Interviewer**: For K5000?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I paid K5000 for the bricks, and then I collected them too."
26,2022-07-27,95, **Interviewer**: Did you pay the people who collected the bricks?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I paid them. They transport the bricks on a wheelbarrow. It was 300 bricks. I remember I was told by the installers to gather 300 bricks. I paid 2 people K1000 each, if not K1200. I have forgotten, it has been some time."
26,2022-07-27,96," **Interviewer**: And, the sand?", **Interviewee**: I think I paid K500.
26,2022-07-27,97, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: On that, I will give you wrong information because I do not know where they bought the equipment."
26,2022-07-27,98, **Interviewer**: We are the remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas? What can you say about biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is good, it is important, and it has the potential of helping many people. It can also help to save and protect the environment. And, looking at the current state of our forests and environment, I think it is a solution to this problem. However, this can only be realized when the digesters are installed properly and are working."
26,2022-07-27,99, **Interviewer**: How is it important and how can it help many?," **Interviewee**: It can help people in terms of cooking as well as fertilizer from the digestate. So people especially those that do not have resources to buy fertilizer can fully utilize digesters by taking digestate to the farms. Thus, people can benefit from digesters in two ways; one as an energy source for cooking, and secondly as fertilizer for maize."
26,2022-07-27,100," **Interviewer**: I want to understand you clearly. And, I must say I'm impressed by your level of knowledge and understanding. You saw that the digestate was just flowing anyhow, and if I heard you correctly, you were told that the slurry could be used as fertilizer. So, why didn't you commit to make a thing to collect the digestate to use in your farm as fertilizer? I mean, the way you have explained I can see that you thought about doing that or you could have even made another pit or even bought a bucket. I do not think that could have been a challenge for you."," **Interviewee**: If they bring with the digester today, I could do that because I've seen it. However, when you have a new thing it's always hard to know everything about it. I'm now saying the digestate could be fertilizer because, generally, before taking cow manure to the fields we first splash water on it to take away its heat \[strength\]. In the same way, the digester takes out of the heat from the cow manure. The heat is what we see or say is biogas, and the slurry is the processed fertilizer that can be used. So, in the first place I did not have this idea because it was a new thing to me and it was my first time to use it. The other thing is that we did not receive training before and after the installation of the digester. I think if the installer had given us training, then we would have knowledge, and maybe we could have putting a bucket to collect the digestate all the times. As for the drainage, they said we could put drainage for the digestate to flow into, and it's exactly what we did."
26,2022-07-27,101," **Interviewer**: Okay, I see. What's the future of biogas in Malawi? Is the future bright or dark?"," **Interviewee**: I think it can be bright, if and only if the digesters are installed properly and the installers need organization in their conduct... If some people are able to use biogas for generating energy for maize mills, then it means that this thing is viable. Moreover, it also shows that it could be done here in Malawi. However, the problem with Malawi is that the people are corrupt in their conduct. I don't think it's proper to install a digester without lining it with a brick wall around it. I don't think it makes sense to send someone to install a digester without lining it. Yet, they said themselves that the hole needs lining. They know, or they have learnt somewhere that a digester bag is supposed be placed in a lined brick wall. The trainer who said this was not an ordinary person like me. It was someone who had gone through proper training. So he knew what he was talking about. People when they are leaving for fieldwork are told what materials would be required, or they even know themselves whatever is needed. So, it didn\'t make sense to me to see the installer coming here without cement expecting to find cement here, and even saying he was not given cement - that not true. So, change needs to start at the top. The top managers need to be serious. They need to provide necessary resources to the field workers. If they can't, field workers need to tell top managers what is not practical and what is not. And, when fieldworkers are not given what to be provide, then they shouldn't bother coming to the community people. Because, when things don't work, it's people on the ground that actually get all the blame. For example, let's talk about the cement in my case. I don't expect a person who has spent K200000 on digester can to fail to buy cement, and that time cement was very cheap. I think it was around K4000. Do you think a person would fail to buy two bags of cement at K8000 to protect a thing of K200000. That\`s not true. It's doesn't make sense!"
26,2022-07-27,102," **Interviewer**: Yeah, it's doesn't make sense. And, that's why I even laughed when you pointed that out. Do you feel someone somewhere stole the bags of cement?"," **Interviewee**: Yes - no doubt. The trainer said that a digester must build with a brick wall around it. This person was not an ordinary person; he was learned, and knew these things. So, it didn't make sense to see the other person coming without cement."
26,2022-07-27,103," **Interviewer**: Okay, last one, if you would have designed your own waste or any intervention, what could you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: That's a difficult one for me. Maybe, if you could give me examples."
26,2022-07-27,104," **Interviewer**: There are so many alternatives. You think of solar panels, compost making. I was at one house there they told me Wonder Bag. Do you know that?", **Interviewee**: No
26,2022-07-27,105," **Interviewer**: There is windmill. There is so many, electricity!", **Interviewee**: I would choose solar panels.
26,2022-07-27,106, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: Because it can be used in different ways; you can use solar for cooking, lighting and even for charging our phones -- and with the current electricity problem, I think it can help a lot in that regard."
26,2022-07-27,107, **Interviewer**: Even biogas can do that! Do you know?, **Interviewee**: (laughs) We weren't told so how could we know.
26,2022-07-27,108," **Interviewer**: (laughs) that's was my last question. In closing, do you have anything to say?"," **Interviewee**: First, I would like to say thank you for coming. We have always being thankful to the people that gave us the digesters. Moreover, I do not take it for granted that I was one of the few beneficiaries. But, my plea is if you start a project, you need to ensure that you have started on a good note in order to finish it properly or not to end it unfinished. For example, if you look at the organization that installed biogas, they got funding from donors. So donors do follow up projects, it could even be that the people who you are with are donors trying to follow up on the project to see if the digesters were indeed installed. So, if there were shortcuts, some of us don't mind, we don\'t hide the truth, we just say what happened. So, this may cause projects to end prematurely and even block others from benefitting from the projects. For students who are doing research work to gain knowledge. My plea is first they need to build proper working relationship with the people, and then in the future, work with the communities to make the necessary changes. They need to give back to the community. I hope you understand!"
26,2022-07-27,109," **Interviewer**: Yeah, I do. Okay, thanks. That is the end of our interview.",NA
27,2022-07-27,1,Where did the digester originate from?, **Interviewee**: The first people who came said the digester was from China.
27,2022-07-27,2,When was it built?,We received two different digesters. The first digester we got in 2015 and the second one who got in 2016.
27,2022-07-27,3,Did you get it from the same people?,Yeah - Both times we got it through the agriculture office.
27,2022-07-27,4,"Who built it first one, and how long did it take to build?","The people from the agriculture officer came and told us as they were coming to install a digester here. When they came, they dug a hole, made feedstock for the digester, and then connected the pipes. It did not last long because the people were somewhat not serious. It was not as big as the second one; it was 3 meter long, and half a meter wide. Its hole was one meter deep. The second one was huge, and was made of a high quality plastic digester bag. It was 3 meters in length and width."
27,2022-07-27,5,What do you mean when you say installers were not serious?,"The way the installers were coming to install it, we thought they were coming just to do some trials. It seemed so to some extent, and I even had doubts if it was going to work as they were installing it. And, it was not surprising to see that it failed; we never even cooked on it once. Of course, it produced the flame, but it was not enough to cook. It produced the flames for 4 months, and then stopped completely. We never cooked on it even once. As for the second one, we used it for a year."
27,2022-07-27,6,"So, the first one was for experiment?","Yeah, it produced flames, but it never worked. In addition, after sunlight the digester bag got stiff. The pipes were very short too. That was its pipe \[points to the pipe\]. The second one, to be honest was good. They even gave us spare clips to tighten the pipes when they got loose. We still have the clips. We have four in the house."
27,2022-07-27,7,What was your role?,"We helped them on every task. For example, when they wanted to make feedstock, we went together to agriculture office to get manure to make feedstock. After, we came back, they showed us how to make feedstock and we made the feedstock ourselves."
27,2022-07-27,8,Who dug it?,"My husband dug the hole together with the person you are with. All the beneficiaries, 5 of us, we were supporting each other in the installation process like in digging and even preparation of the initial feedstock. In our case, at first, we used dry manure, but extension workers stopped us. They told us that it needs fresh manure."
27,2022-07-27,9,Why?,"Because fresh manure produces gas faster than dry manure; so, after that we used to feed it with fresh manure. Then, they also taught us how to make feedstock. They said the quantity of cow manure and water should be equal."
27,2022-07-27,10,How were you selected as a beneficiary?,"They chose us because we had plenty of livestock that time. People with livestock were chosen because animal manure was the primary feedstock for the digester. So, for us cow manure was not a problem because we live near the agriculture office, which has a cow house. In addition, we had many pigs ourselves too. I think we had more than 20 pigs. We also had goats that time."
27,2022-07-27,11,"I have two questions on that. First, how did the agriculture office know that you had plenty of livestock? Secondly, how did you know that having manure was a requisite to be selected as a beneficiary?","We live very close to the agriculture office \[less than 100 meters\], so they had to know that we had livestock. In addition, we were supplying them with young pigeons. We were also selling them guinea fowl eggs. So, they were coming here regularly. Even the agriculture district officer \[DO\] was coming here often to see how we were to manage our livestock. So, I think when they saw that we were doing good in livestock management, they thought we could also manage the digester."
27,2022-07-27,12,"Oh, I see. What was the selection process?","One extension worker came to tell us that at some point people were going to come to give biogas digesters to the people. But, before this were also involved in another project which were run by the agriculture office as well. For example, I was involved in a training an energy efficient stove-making and briquette-making project. After that project, they came with the first digesters. Around the same time, I was also involved in solar dry project. At the end of the training, the project implementers gave me a vegetable drying machine, which I still have today."
27,2022-07-27,13,Did you know about biogas before?,"I learnt about biogas when I was attending the efficient stove and briquette making training. During the training, the trainers did touch on biogas. At that time, I did not even think that one day I was going to own a biogas digester."
27,2022-07-27,14,What did they say about biogas?,"They said a biogas digester is equipment, which produces gas out of manure. Then , they said the gas could be used for cooking. After that, that is when question started to come. People were like how could people cook using manure. Then, they talked about the processes that are involved to produce."
27,2022-07-27,15,What did they say about the process itself?,"They said if there is sunlight, mix manure and water in a digester produces gas. The gas is what produces fire for cooking. And, indeed, when it was brought here, on sunny days the day was get like lit was on the verge of burst. We were even scared that the bag would burst when it was full because of sunlight."
27,2022-07-27,16, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) when they came they told us that they were coming to install an innovation for cooking I was very keen to see. I remember when I was in school I heard about it, but I did not really understand it because it was theory. So, I saw that an opportunity to learn more about it. I remember I hear this when I was in school but I did not really understand it because it was theory. So I saw that an opportunity to learn more about it. And, honestly, we had high expectations."
27,2022-07-27,17, **Interviewer**: What subject was this?, **Interviewee**: We have a subject in secondary school called science and technology.
27,2022-07-27,18, **Interviewer**: What did the installers tell you expect from this?, **Interviewee**: Which installers? The first or second ones?
27,2022-07-27,19, **Interviewer**: Both.," **Interviewee**: Both of them focused on environmental protection and conservation; they said the digester was brought here to save the environment. They mentioned that if we could use it accordingly, we would never go to the forest to search for firewood again. Moreover, they said we would never buy charcoal again; and we would never cut a tree to make firewood. They even went on to say we would be able to warm water in the morning and even cook food on time the whole time. On top of this, the installer of the second digester, who was a crippled old professor from Lilongwe, cooked rice porridge and we ate. And, in his speech, he mentioned the biogas digester could be connected to a solar system and then power it to produce energy for charging phones. In addition, they mentioned that in the course of feeding the 200-liter digester bag, it would start releasing digestate at the outlet. And, the digestate could be utilized as fertilizer for our crops."
27,2022-07-27,20, **Interviewer**: How did you make the outlet?," **Interviewee**: For the first digester we did not make a hole. As for the second digester, we made a special hole for collecting the digestate, and when we tried the digestate, we saw that it worked. So, we used to dry and keep the digestate for the coming growing season."
27,2022-07-27,21," **Interviewer**: Oh, you used the digestate?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, we used it. We used it because we were told to try out it. Thus, we used it once, and we saw that it was productive."
27,2022-07-27,22, **Interviewer**: How much digestate did you try your crops with?," **Interviewee**: It was only 5kg of digestate as it was for experiment purposes only. And, we added water because we were told it is too strong so it wilts maize, if used undiluted."
27,2022-07-27,23,Why then didn't you proceed to use it after?,"(laughs) honestly, we did not continue to use it."
27,2022-07-27,24,Why? Were you not satisfied with its performance? Was it tiresome?,"No, the maize did well - It did well. Maybe, we did not continue because are used to what we were doing. And, they said it is very strong that it wilts maize, so we could not gamble on our maize. That is why we continued with what we usually do."
27,2022-07-27,25,What kind of training did they give you?,"I did not receive any training. The training I received on biogas came when I was attending the energy efficient stove making and briquette-making training. The trainers did mention biogas during the training because just like efficient stoves and briquettes, it also conserves the environment. So, honestly speaking, I did not receive any special training regarding biogas. The training I received was about efficient stove making and briquette. Biogas was just a subsidiary discussion."
27,2022-07-27,26,"So, when they came to install it, what did they say about biogas? What did they say? What did you learn?","They educated us on what things to feed it. They said we could feed it with any type of manure, whether it is human manure, food waste, and anything else that decomposes. So advised us take such things and add water to make feedstock. If we took 20 liters of manure, we were also adding 20 liters of water. So we were mixing that with our hands, and then pour the feedstock into the digester. After that, they told us to close the outlet, inlet and gas valve. Then the things would start heating up after 30 minutes or an hour, and we could see the bag inflating. Then, we would start getting gas at the stove and start cook. We could even cook beans, and people were coming to see us cooking. People were surprised and wondered how manure could produce gas for cooking."
27,2022-07-27,27,"So the training was basically about how to prepare feedstock and which materials could be used as feedstock and not. You are saying you prepared feedstock using bare hands, how did you feel?","(laughs) no, only if it were human manure! For human manure, they told us that we could put it directly into the digester using a shovel. As for cow manure, we had no problems. We were simply going to the agriculture office's cow house to collect cow manure in the morning. It's became some sort of routine task somehow."
27,2022-07-27,28," **Interviewer**: You say you were not feeling disgusted, I mean, how?","Of course, at first, we had issues; we even used to have minor headaches. But, we became accustomed to it. And of course, we had pigs and if you can compare cattle to pigs, you would see that cattle are better off in terms of hygiene."
27,2022-07-27,29,Why were you not using shovels all the times and then stir the feedstock with a stick or something?,"Manure in a cow house is mixed. Some are dry and some are fresh. So, to separate the two when collecting with a shovel is difficult, if not impossible. Thus, to collect strictly fresh manure for the feedstock you need fresh manure to use hands."
27,2022-07-27,30,"Okay, my understanding is that you did not receive training on biogas. However, at some point you learned about biogas as a subsidiary subject during training on efficient stove making and briquettes. On top of this, when they installers came talk about this when they told you how to make feedstock, what types of materials you can use as feedstock. How prepared to run or operate the digester did you feel you were?","Of course, yes. After the installers went, we stayed there for a month without doing anything to the point that the bag deflated. We did not do that because we abandoned it, no, we did that on purpose. We wanted to see if what the installers told us would work. And, if it did not work, would have called them because they left us their numbers. But, when we restarted it ourselves it worked, and it was even worked during the rainy season. During rainy season, when we saw that no sunlight, we were feeding it even more. Because the bag was full of feedstock, the pressure in the bag was high, and it was always inflated. People were even asking how we were able to make the bag inflated during rainy season. So with gas we could cook porridge and boil a fair amount of water \[30 minutes -- 45 minutes\], and then it would deflate and stop working. But, things in summer were better. I could cook fast, for example, even when there was a funeral service around the community, people would ask how I managed cook fast.... And, to ensure that it was working effectively, they told us to check the gas connector whenever we saw that the bag was deflating oddly. So, sometimes we could find it leaking. Then, we would try to glue it with super glue or with seal tape. To troubleshoot a gas connector, they told us to mix water with soap to create foam. Then, they told us to pour the foam on the surface of the bag or gas connector to detect a leak easily. It was something similar to what people do when fixing bicycle tubes."
27,2022-07-27,31,How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?,I was using firewood.
27,2022-07-27,32,Charcoal," **Interviewee**: Sometimes, yeah. But, very rarely."
27,2022-07-27,33, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the wood?, **Interviewee**: From those mountains.
27,2022-07-27,34," **Interviewer**: Oh, that is far."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it is very far."
27,2022-07-27,35," **Interviewer**: If you leave at this time, 12 noon, what time would you return?."," **Interviewee**: It takes about 4 hours to go there, find wood and come back. So, we could be here at 4 or 5 PM."
27,2022-07-27,36, **Interviewer**: It is really far.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and it is not as if you go there you find the wood at one point. You search around... The mountain looks like it is not far from here but it is far."
27,2022-07-27,37," **Interviewer**: Yeah, to see a mountain like that it means it is far.", **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
27,2022-07-27,38," **Interviewer**: You told me you had many livestock. But, I'm not seeing it hear?"," **Interviewee**: I have two school going children and my husband is away, he\`s in South Africa. So, I sold the livestock to make ends meet."
27,2022-07-27,39," **Interviewer**: Pal, you need to work hard - do not play at school. Mom sacrificed the livestock for your get education, so you need to work hard!"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, he is form 4 \[last grade of secondary school\]. We are just waiting for his final exams. They are starting next month, so we will see soon, if it was worth it to sell the cows."
27,2022-07-27,40," **Interviewer**: Oh, nice. Good luck.How did you manage feedstock before the intervention?"," **Interviewee**: We used it as manure. We were basically getting manure and food waste, and then put it in a sack bag and line with a plastic bag and store it until the sack bag got eaten. We were also adding ash to the mixture.... Also, people were coming to collect manure from the cow house to use as fertilizer for their maize and vegetables."
27,2022-07-27,41, **Interviewer**: Were you selling?," **Interviewee**: Ah, no."
27,2022-07-27,42,Why?, **Interviewee**: You know friendship. We were also going to their gardens to ask for vegetables.
27,2022-07-27,43," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. Let us talk how your digesters worked. We will focus more on the second one, but I will also ask concerning the first digester. How much feedstock did you start the digesters with? Take me through both the first and second digester?"," **Interviewee**: For the first one we used 2 buckets (20 liters) of cow manure. I remember that time we gathered dry manure and we were told by the installers to use fresh manure. So, we had to go and collect fresh manure again."
27,2022-07-27,44, **Interviewer**: How long did it take the first digester to start?," **Interviewee**: The bag started inflating after the second day. It fully inflated after 4 or 5 days. So it took 5 days to start up. After 5 days, it started producing fire and it somewhat worked. After that, we used it."
27,2022-07-27,45, **Interviewer**: How long did you use the digester before it stopped?, **Interviewee**: It took four months like I said. But we were not using it regularly; We were using it here and there.
27,2022-07-27,46, **Interviewer**: What do you mean here there?," **Interviewee**: If we cooked on it, it was taking another week to cook on it again. So we were waiting for a week for it to pick up again. The first digester had bigissues. It was different from the second one."
27,2022-07-27,47,What caused the first digester to fail?," **Interviewee**: It become tiresome; we could feed it, but the bag could not get inflated and could not get fire. At first, it produced fire, but after a short time the intensity of the first started diminishing up to the point of stopping completely. We kept on feeding it but nothing happened. Then, we decided to take it out to protect it from thieves. Since, we were also hoping that the installers were going to come back and some point so we wanted them to find it in a good state."
27,2022-07-27,48, **Interviewer**: So what was the problem?," **Interviewee**: We do not know what went wrong. The production of gas started diminishing after short time, and it eventually stopped completely. So we were expecting the installers to come and fix it, and then tell us what was the problem. So, we took out bag because a lot of people showed interest in it, so we thought that they could come and stole it."
27,2022-07-27,49," **Interviewer**: Let us talk about the second one. We will talk about it at length because it is what we knew of and it is what you had more time with. Let us talk about how it worked. Before starting using it, how much feedstock did you feed it with to start it up?"," **Interviewee**: we started by pouring 4 buckets of pure water into the digester. For this one we did not use 20 liter buckets instead we use the 40 liter buckets. Then, I collected 4 wheelbarrows of manure from cow manure. I did not make the mistake of collecting dry cow, because I had learned from the first digester that it needs fresh manure. After collecting the manure, we started mixing it with water in 20-liter buckets. We were adding a very small amount of water because the manure was already semi-liquid."
27,2022-07-27,50, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start it up?," **Interviewee**: We started feeding it in the morning. And when we woke up the second day we found the bag standing. The bag did inflate fully though. In the evening, it started making sounds like something was boiling in it. The following day, it was a very sunny day so the bag got fully standing. It was after five days that we started using."
27,2022-07-27,51," **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning? I mean, how much cooking time, did you get?"," **Interviewee**: We did not fully use it because you wanted to test it.So we were sometimes just putting a pot of water. Then, we would find out that the gas was finished before even the water boiled. And they said that every time we were cooking we needed a bucket of feedstock to replenish the gas that was being lost.... So it was going off even when we were cooking. Thus, every time we cooked, we made feedstock so that we could not run out of gas. It was more of boosting the fire just as we do with firewood."
27,2022-07-27,52, **Interviewer**: Were you putting a bag of sand on top of the digester to boost the fire?, **Interviewee**: No.
27,2022-07-27,53, **Interviewer**: So you never put a bag of sand or step on it to boost fire?," **Interviewee**: No, but at the end when it started producing very little gas and saw that gas was depleting fast in the bag, we started putting a stone on top of bag the boost the fire."
27,2022-07-27,54, **Interviewer**: Who told you to do that?," **Interviewee**: We thought on our own that if less gas is coming out, we needed something on top of the bag to exert pressure."
27,2022-07-27,55, **Interviewer**: So was it helping?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was."
27,2022-07-27,56, **Interviewer**: How did you use the gas?, **Interviewee**: It was only for cooking.
27,2022-07-27,57, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: It was manure, any type of manure. On top of that, they said any biodegradable thing. So, every dead living organism we collected and put in the digester.... In addition, no metallic thing was allowed."
27,2022-07-27,58, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: Because it does not degrade and produce any bacteria.
27,2022-07-27,59, **Interviewer**: How often were you feeding it?, **Interviewee**: We used to feed it everyday.
27,2022-07-27,60, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock were you feeding it?," **Interviewee**: We used to feed it with a 20-liter bucket of cow manure. To this, we added 20 liters of water."
27,2022-07-27,61, **Interviewer**: So you weren't able to cook 3 times a day?," **Interviewee**: Yes, and we were even surprised about it. We used to cook once in a day especially in the afternoon. The bag was deflating whenever the sun was gone."
27,2022-07-27,62," **Interviewer**: So, you could not cook three times a day?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, we could not cook three times a day. However, it was producing very little flames in the evening sometimes. It was not enough to cook something on thought."
27,2022-07-27,63, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee2**: Mostly it was I. Sometimes, my father would feed it too."
27,2022-07-27,64, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We were mixing cow manure and water with our hands. We did not use a mixer because it was not breaking lumps in the manure as we wanted. So, we used to break all the lumps with hands till the feedstock was smooth and thick. Then, we were adding pure water to the feedstock."
27,2022-07-27,65," **Interviewer**: so you were making feedstock of 20 liters of water and 20 liters of manure. To this, you used to add another 20 liters of water?", **Interviewee**: That is correct.
27,2022-07-27,66," **Interviewer**: So, it was like 20 liters of manure against 40 liters of water.", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
27,2022-07-27,67, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you to add extra 20 liters of water after making the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: No, but every time we added the water, it was not taking time for the digester bag to get full; it was like every time we added water the digester was making a sound like that of boiling liquid. The bag was inflating as if it was about to burst, and it was scary. For example, if we sat here, we could move out of fear."
27,2022-07-27,68," **Interviewer**: Why do you think that was necessary? I mean, what made you do that?"," **Interviewee**: We just thought that it needed water; not water in the feedstock, but just pure water."
27,2022-07-27,69," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: That was the biggest challenge we faced. We had no spare parts. Therefore, when there was a problem gas connector, we had challenges to fix it. Of course, they said that if it gets disjointed, we could use an adhesive. However, I do not think the adhesive we used was suitable for that, because every time we fixed the issues, it was not taking time to separate. So, I think there was a special adhesive for bonding the gas connector, but we did not know it, and they didn't give us."
27,2022-07-27,70, **Interviewer**: What else were you told in regards to maintenance?," **Interviewee**: They said that the digester bag should not be covered in water when it's in the hole. They also told us not to use water with soap when making feedstock. They told us that we should not use grey water, for example, water collected after cleaning dishes; they advised use that water should come directly from them borehole."
27,2022-07-27,71, **Interviewer**: Why was water with soap not allowed?," **Interviewee2**: I just think that it affects the production of gas in the reactor. I do not really know what happens in the bag though, but that is what I think. They did not explain how soap affects the digester.... Maybe it is because soap contains chemicals or its foam affects gas production in the reactor."
27,2022-07-27,72, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for maintenance?," **Interviewee2**: It was my father. But, if the problem was big, they gave us numbers to call."
27,2022-07-27,73, **Interviewer**: Which problems did your father solve?," **Interviewee**: We had problems with the gas connector as it used to detach time and again. In addition, the flat rubber ropes connecting the digester bag to the outlet and inlet pipes were constantly being damaged, as they could not stand sunlight. So, we used to buy and replace them frequently."
27,2022-07-27,74, **Interviewer**: How often did the flat rubber rope take to get damaged?,"It was dependent on the sun. If it was October, it took about a month or so. Then, gas connector would also detach often. Then, we would go buy adhesive at K400 to seal the connection."
27,2022-07-27,75," **Interviewer**: You have said it did not meet your needs, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we could not cook, as you wanted; we were only using it one a day."
27,2022-07-27,76," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay, and when this happened you were using firewood?"," **Interviewee**: At night, we were using firewood or charcoal."
27,2022-07-27,77," **Interviewer**: What challenges did you encounter? I know you have talked many issues, but could you please take me through the challenges?", **Interviewee**: The first one was the continuous failure of gas connector.
27,2022-07-27,78, **Interviewer**: How did that problem manifest?," **Interviewee**: We were told that if we see the digester bag deflating fast than usual when it was full, then we should know gas was leaking at that particular connection. I remember when that happened the first time, we glued the connection with an adhesive and it worked. I think it only took two months before it happened again."
27,2022-07-27,79, **Interviewer**: What other challenges did you face?," **Interviewee**: The second problem was that we were making feedstock with some sort of fear. We thought that after installation, they were going to give us gloves for feedstock preparation. But, they didn't, so some people were saying handling manure with bare hands causes physical damage. Some were saying manure contains pathogens. Therefore, we were nervous that pathogens would enter our bodies through the fingernails, and causes diseases. So, these were the three problems we encountered."
27,2022-07-27,80," **Interviewer**: When you had the issue of the at the gas connection, did you try to fix it yourself or did you call first?"," **Interviewee**: We called first and they offered that solution of using an adhesive to bond it. And, they asked us to inform them if it didn't work, so that they could come."
27,2022-07-27,81," **Interviewer**: When it failed again, did you inform them?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they came and bonded the connection with an adhesive different from us. That is why I said they had the materials for maintenance, but simply did want to give us."
27,2022-07-27,82, **Interviewer**: What adhesive did they use?," **Interviewee**: The adhesive was contained in a certain metallic tube, cooper-like. And, when they used it lasted for sometime; and it was the same adhesive they used the first time during installation."
27,2022-07-27,83, **Interviewer**: How long did it take that time?, **Interviewee**: It took 4 months or so before detaching.
27,2022-07-27,84, **Interviewer**: How long did it take them to come when you reported the problem?, **Interviewee**: When we called them that it was broken down that it didn\`t take long to come. It did not take a month. I think it took two weeks.
27,2022-07-27,85," **Interviewer**: When was the first time the gas connector malfunctioned? In addition, how many times did it fail?"," **Interviewee**: I cannot really remember. I think it was after 3 months, but it didn't go more than 5 months."
27,2022-07-27,86," **Interviewer**: How, many times did it fail?"," **Interviewee**: 4 times, I think."
27,2022-07-27,87, **Interviewer**: What about the rubber strips?, **Interviewee**: We started having issues after 6 months; and it was a big problem in summer because of the sun.
27,2022-07-27,88," **Interviewer**: (show table of interventions) have you seen something like this? What do you think about this kind of information, and do you think it would have helped you?", **Interviewee**: We have never seen it.
27,2022-07-27,89, **Interviewer**: What do you think about this information and do you think it would have helped in your case?," **Interviewee**: It would have helped us a lot, and this thing would not have broken."
27,2022-07-27,90, **Interviewer**: How and why?, **Interviewee**: We could have known what to do if there was a problem.
27,2022-07-27,91," **Interviewer**: So, you did not know what to do?", **Interviewee**: Zero (laughs)
27,2022-07-27,92," **Interviewer**: So, if you had the information, we would have been talking a different story today?"," **Interviewee**: We would have asked you to wait for lunch, just like with the person who installed it."
27,2022-07-27,93, **Interviewer**: (laughs) it that true?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and they told us that it has a 5-year guarantee. But, we only use it for a year. So, it was going to expire this year."
27,2022-07-27,94," **Interviewer**: Okay, we are going towards the end of the interview. How would you describe the current state of your digester today? If the installers call you today and ask about the digester, what would you say to them?"," **Interviewee**: we would tell them that the digester is dead - It is dead. But, we still have some of the equipment."
27,2022-07-27,95," **Interviewer**: (laughs) it is ""dead?"""," **Interviewee**: (laughs) you laughing? (Laughs). We would tell him it is dead, but we still have some of the equipment."
27,2022-07-27,96, **Interviewer**: What equipment do you have?, **Interviewee**: It's what we have here.
27,2022-07-27,97," **Interviewer**: It is the stove, the bag, and the bottle. Just one?"," **Interviewee**: We had 2 bottles, one was green and the other was white. I remember one was placed in the kitchen. It had some stones in it. So, the white one is lost."
27,2022-07-27,98, **Interviewer**: What were the bottles for?," **Interviewee**: They said it was for purifying the gas. The gas contains moisture when it is coming from the digester. So, to remove water from the gas, they use the stones in the bottle. The other one was where water was accumulating. So after some time, we used to take out the water from the bottles."
27,2022-07-27,99, **Interviewer**: Why were you removing the water?," **Interviewee**: To remove the water because it blocks the gas. As a result, gas fails to come at the stock."
27,2022-07-27,100, **Interviewer**: Did it ever occur?," **Interviewee**: No, we were taking out the water frequently."
27,2022-07-27,101," **Interviewer**: Oh, yeah. That's a water trap and a sulphur trap. Moving on, you have said that the digester is dead now, but you still have some of the equipment. How did reach this stage? And, in your opinion, what caused it?"," **Interviewee**: It is because the problems I have talked about became so regular and annoying. And after it malfunctioned, we called them, but the phone was just ringing. We thought they were busy but they never called back. Then, we just decided to take the digester bag and the equipment out for safety reasons, hoping that one day when they come they should find the equipment it good shape. It is just unfortunate that some of the equipment got damaged, because our house collapsed at some point."
27,2022-07-27,102," **Interviewer**: You have said that since now it is not working when you want to cook, you use firewood and charcoal, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
27,2022-07-27,103," **Interviewer**: And now you do not have livestock because you sold them to pay fees and to meet family needs, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah. But, we still have chicken. We have 3 big ones and 17 small ones."
27,2022-07-27,104," **Interviewer**: Oh, great. How much did the reactor cost?"," **Interviewee**: They told me the figure. I think the whole cost K80000, if not K800000."
27,2022-07-27,105, **Interviewer**: And all this was provided by an NGO?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I think so."
27,2022-07-27,106, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: We contributed 4 buckets and a wheelbarrow, which we used to make the first feedstock. I would also say we contributed labour"
27,2022-07-27,107, **Interviewer**: How much labor?," **Interviewee**: For the first digester, it took us only one day, and we even dug without their supervision, as they were not around. We dug it ourselves There was my brother, father and I. The second one, we dug for one day as well. We dug it, while the installers were there as we dug it on the day of its installation. We dug it ourselves. There was my brother, father and I. Nevertheless, two more people from the installers' side did help us to speed the work. I think, in total we were four or five people. The boss was there, but he was not digging with us."
27,2022-07-27,108, **Interviewer**: Did you line it with a brick wall around it?," **Interviewee**: I think the first one we plastered. But, the second one we didn\`t do any masonry work."
27,2022-07-27,109, **Interviewer**: Where did you get cement?," **Interviewee**: They provided the cement, and we only provided water and sand. There were no bricks. So, we just plastered the whole hole to prevent moist"
27,2022-07-27,110, **Interviewer**: That was some work!," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but everything was done from us. The three of us worked on the first digester."
27,2022-07-27,111, **Interviewer**: What kind of special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: uh, I do not think the pipes are from here; the pipes are not from Malawi. Considering what they said about the pipes that are different from other pipes, I do not think they are from Malawi. I think they said there is something in the pipes, I do not know what it was though, and that the pipes are durable than other pipes. And, it's true the pipes are durable. You can't cut the pipes with no ordinary object."
27,2022-07-27,112, **Interviewer**: So that is what make you think it is from abroad?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I think it is from abroad."
27,2022-07-27,113," **Interviewer**: You said you do not buy firewood. You just get it free at the mountains. So, we can't said it saved you money the time it was working.... It only saved you time and energy, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
27,2022-07-27,114, **Interviewer**: What was the biggest difference in your life the time it was working?," **Interviewee**: The biggest change was sometimes though very rarely we were buying a pack of charcoal. With that were able to cook in the morning, evening, and even keep some. Had it not been for the digester then we could have required two packs. So, we were saving a little something because of the digester."
27,2022-07-27,115, **Interviewer**: How much was a pack of charcoal?," **Interviewee**: K150, but it is now K250."
27,2022-07-27,116, **Interviewer**: So you were saving money to some extent.... How often did you use charcoal?," **Interviewee**: It was for only when we had no firewood. So, it rarely happened. Maybe once in 4 months."
27,2022-07-27,117, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I would be very happy if it could be the revamped. Of course, many people were interested in it too because many people were coming to see it. People were taking pictures of us using the solar dry machine and even the digester itself. So, it was not just helping us here. It was also helping people outside the country. So personally, I can be very happy."
27,2022-07-27,118," **Interviewer**: If you can talk on how it worked, its props and cons and all that. What would you say?"," **Interviewee**: Personally, as a housewife, I would say it was maintaining and restoring my body energy as I was taking little time to cook fast, and was not searching firewood. I was able to do other things as well because it was fast, as its fire was intense. The challenge I faced was that, it was leaking gas at times as such I was getting very little gas at the stove even whilst I was cooking. So, some food would lose taste or texture."
27,2022-07-27,119, **Interviewer**: What do you think could be done to stop all those problems?," **Interviewee**: We need to sit down with the installers and talk about these problems, and see how we can overcome them."
27,2022-07-27,120, **Interviewer**: Which problems are we talking in particular?," **Interviewee**: Gas leakages and I think the gas we used in its entire lifespan was less compared to the gas we lost at the gas connector. I mean, we used to see heat waves escaping from the joint here when the bag was full."
27,2022-07-27,121," **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas, my brother?"," **Interviewee**: As for me, you can see that I was dedicated and committed to use biogas. So if another opportunity comes to own one or something similar, I would be very happy."
27,2022-07-27,122, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi? Is it bright or dim?," **Interviewee**: It is dim especially when you considered how these digesters worked; they are all dead. My wish when we got the digester was that one day we would use it for lighting. I was told by the installer that these things can be connected to solar or an inverter to the produce light. And I was very excited to see it produce light one day. So looking at that prospect today, I see that that cannot happen, and this in general has no future. I feel like we have high expectations of it, which cannot be fulfilled. In addition, we were told that it is possible to connect digester to a connected to pit latrine, but that too did not happening."
27,2022-07-27,123,"You seem that you want it again. If someone can give you a digester or let us say, someone gives out 10 digesters today. Do you think in five or ten years we can find them working? If not, what could be done?"," **Interviewee**: 5 or 10 years is a talk order. But, if I can get one, I think you can find it working because I know this. But for someone who has never used it, I do not think that could be done. As for us, we know what it needs, what it wants, so we can keep it for long."
27,2022-07-27,124, **Interviewer**: What do you know now that you think someone who has never used it wouldn\`t know that may affect its life span?," **Interviewee**: First, we know how to handle it; we know what it takes to fix it when it breaks down. We know its maintenance. If they come today again, I would tell them to leave spare parts especially adhesive for tighten the joint at the top. And, to be honest, that is its major problem. So, now we know how we can handle that problem on our own. But, still would need materials for that purpose, and not what we improvised. So, we would ask the materials that are made specifically for that purpose, because we now know it. And, I do not think if you can give out to 10 that you can find all them working. I am sure 2 or 3 people would give up because it\'s not easy to feed it; it is not easy to source water and manure. That time we were lucky because the borehole was at the agriculture office (150 to 200m away). But, now if we need water we get from the lake \[700 meters +\]. That is a long distance. Therefore, it's easy for a person to abandon it. But, for us we know its importance so we could hold on to it."
27,2022-07-27,125," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: We would definitely choose something else. We can choose biogas. The last time they promised us that this thing was going to work for 5 years or so. But, we were only able to use it for a year. So, we have fears about its durability."
27,2022-07-27,126," **Interviewer**: So, which intervention would you choose?", **Interviewee**: We are more than willing to try any other intervention instead of biogas.
27,2022-07-27,127, **Interviewer**: Clear. So what would you go for?," **Interviewee**: There are energy efficient stoves, briquettes."
27,2022-07-27,128, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: They help one to save money, and even save the environment. When you put briquettes in an efficient stove, the fire is good. It is just like gas. The air is clean."
27,2022-07-27,129," **Interviewer**: Last one. You attended a briquette making training, but you still use firewood, why?"," **Interviewee**: To make briquettes you need to have certain equipment, and we weren't given."
27,2022-07-27,130," **Interviewer**: what are your last words, quick one?"," **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming. I know your coming here is for a purpose. For us we can only say we have welcomed you, and if you have any work, whether it is biogas or not, in the future here we are more than willing to work with you. We are not slowing down. However, our plea is when you are coming with an intervention it should be something that has worked somewhere. You should know your product inside out, so that when you say it has a guarantee of 3 or 5 years, it should really be that. In closing, thanks for coming. In addition, if you have a product that you want to introduce in the future, you should do things differently. You should bring spare parts, and teach us about the product, so that we will be in a position to manage it. Thanks."
27,2022-07-27,131, **Interviewer**: Well spoken. Thanks for the interview!,NA
28,2022-07-27,1,"First question, where did this digest originate from?","We do not specifically know where it came from. But, we know it came through the agriculture office. They asked people if they might be willing and able to manage it and we told them could manage it. So, they brought it here. But, we don't know who really brought it here."
28,2022-07-27,2,"When you say manage it, what do you mean?","I mean, I was someone who had access to cow manure, so I knew it was possible for me to run it."
28,2022-07-27,3,"So, you had cow manure that time?","Yeah, we also had goats."
28,2022-07-27,4,"Oh, yeah I can see the goat house there.", **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
28,2022-07-27,5,"At that time, how many cows and goats did you have?",We had 20 goats and 5 cows.
28,2022-07-27,6,"Oh, that was a lot. How was the selection process like?","The project implementers liaised with the agriculture office to mobilize people who had access to cow manure. Since we had cows, they approached us, and we accepted it."
28,2022-07-27,7,How meet the agriculture officer?,"The agriculture people sought people who were active and interested in the project. For example, they engaged the people who were forthcoming, committed and good in terms of executing agriculture activities. So, we were chosen because they knew we were going to do a good job; the agriculture people know the community inside out so they know people who are reliable in the community."
28,2022-07-27,8,Have you worked with the agriculture office before?,"Yes, I remember one time I worked with them on a farming demonstration project. So, they saw how hardworking I was. Then, when they saw that the digester would need someone to feed it regularly, they thought of choosing someone who was hard working and had cows; and that is how they chose me."
28,2022-07-27,9,Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: It was a non-governmental organization, which was working with the agriculture office. And, they told us how much money was involved, but I have just forgotten. Nevertheless, it was expensive."
28,2022-07-27,10, **Interviewer**: Did it reach K500000 or a million?," **Interviewee**: I cannot remember. However, they told us the money and it was a lot."
28,2022-07-27,11," **Interviewer**: Who built it? And, when was it built?", **Interviewee**: I do not recall when it was built... Maybe it was 2015 or 2016.
28,2022-07-27,12," **Interviewer**: Okay, how many people from the installation company built it?"," **Interviewee**: Different people were coming. I remember one time a white man and an albino person came... They came in three cars I think. The packed there and did there thing. They connected the pipes and all, then they started cooking. The other people from the community saw it working, so after they installed it they got into their cars and left."
28,2022-07-27,13, **Interviewer**: What was your role?," **Interviewee**: I was responsible for digging the hole, and I removed the sand that was around the area. On the day of first day, two people came and told us how to prepare the feedstock. The second time they came is when they installed it. So, they came two times, and it was two different groups of people."
28,2022-07-27,14, **Interviewer**: So you did the digging?, **Interviewee**: Definitely. I was just given a measuring stick for measurement purposes to use when digging the hole.
28,2022-07-27,15, **Interviewer**: How long was the stick?," **Interviewee**: I do not remember its exact length. But, it was big as the digester bag itself because when I finished digging the hole, the digester bag fitted perfectly when it was full. The digester bag was protruding from the hole with half a meter or one meter when it was full... I must say that the digester bag is huge. A lot of manure went in it, and if we could get that out, we would fill this whole place manure... Sometimes, it was releasing slurry on its own especially when it was hot. They told us that we could use the digestate as fertilizer for our crops."
28,2022-07-27,16," **Interviewer**: So, how was the outlet like?"," **Interviewee**: We dug a hole at the outlet to collect the digestate. But, it could have been better if we had put a drum at the outlet to collect digestate and then take it to the farm. Unfortunately, we did not manage to do that. So, we simply made a drain for digestate to flow into... So, we used to feed the digester with cow menu and sometimes food leftovers. But, we were told not to feed it with soap."
28,2022-07-27,17, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you manage to put a drum at the outlet and use the digestate as fertilizer in your farm?," **Interviewee**: It is because at that time we didn't have the resources to do that; that time we didn't have enough buckets to the extent that we even struggled to store adequate water around the house. So, a bucket could have helped us a lot because it would have allowed us to collect digestate repeatedly to use at our garden. It must be said that the digester was producing a lot of digestate. And, every time it was about to release the digestate, we could tell by how full the bag was and by the sound it was producing after being tapped."
28,2022-07-27,18," **Interviewer**: So, you never used the digestate as fertilizer despite being told that it's fertilizer?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, they told us that we could use the digestate as fertilizer but we never did."
28,2022-07-27,19, **Interviewer**: Why specifically?, **Interviewee**: Because we failed to put a thing to collect the digestate as it was coming out of the outlet.
28,2022-07-27,20," **Interviewer**: But, you dug a structure at the end?", **Interviewee**: It was simply a passage for the digestate to move in.
28,2022-07-27,21, **Interviewer**: Does it make sense for a person who has cows and goats to fail to buy a bucket because of money?," **Interviewee**: The digester came to us unexpectedly; we did not prepare for it, and did not have time to make that arrangement. However, if it had continued or if it was now because of the price of high price of fertilizer, then we could have made such an arrangement. Then, people would have even considered smart people or even bosses. As we can see, the chance of people getting fertilizer this year is almost zero. So, it could have been seen as a special and extraordinary thing for someone to have a means of getting fertilizer."
28,2022-07-27,22, **Interviewer**: What has happened to AIP (Agriculture Input Program) \[Agriculture subsidy program\]?," **Interviewee**: The government has reduced the number of beneficiaries. Secondly, beneficiaries will get less quantities of fertilizer this year - The future looks dark. The government has managed to get 70 metric tons thus far. They need 450,000 metric tons of fertilizer to meet the demand of beneficiaries. But, they will only manage to source 350,000 this year. So, this will negatively affect smallholder farmers who depend on the subsidy program."
28,2022-07-27,23, **Interviewer**: You said you were chosen by the agriculture office because you had capacity as well as the desire to run it. This sounds like you had the right to say no if you so wished. Why did you accept it to be built here?," **Interviewee**: We saw this as an opportunity to stop the rampant cutting down of trees that is degrading the environment. So, this was a great innovation because we felt like it was going to prevent us from destroying the environment. On top of this, we accept it because it was going to help us with cooking."
28,2022-07-27,24," **Interviewer**: Are you damaging the environment? If so, why is it necessary not to?"," **Interviewee**: We saw that with the way people are cutting down trees, we are going to like run out of trees for cooking in the near future and life will be difficult. Yes, of course, it is involving to run it, but the main reason we accepted is that we wanted it to help us in cooking. Also, we considered the work that is involved in making feedstock and going to the forest to look for wood to have fire. Of course, both of these tasks are hard and involving, but you cannot compare them. It is easier to prepare feedstock within the house rather than going to the forest to look for firewood, you see that. On top of this, it was joy to have biogas because of the fire itself; the fire was not blackening the pots with soot; and the flames had no smoke. It was just blue like. You could not really see it during sunlight. At night, that is when the flames were visible. It only needed to be placed in a place where there was no wind. If you cooked on wind then it was taking a very long time. So, you needed to cover the sides to block the wind. Overall, it was a good thing. I feel like for a household to feel at peace, it needs a water tap and an electric stove or biogas."
28,2022-07-27,25, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, we knew about biogas when they came and saw it working."
28,2022-07-27,26," **Interviewer**: You mentioned that this was given to people who had the capacity to run it i.e. who had cattle. Do you know any people who had the potential to get it but did not get it? If so, why didn't they get it?"," **Interviewee**: It's not that every person who had cow benefited from this, because the digesters were only a few. I think we had five digesters here."
28,2022-07-27,27, **Interviewer**: How did you participate in the selection process?," **Interviewee**: We simply accepted that we could manage it. Then, we participated in the building process. We also supported the installers in making first feedstock by getting cow manure and water."
28,2022-07-27,28, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: We got the water from the lake where we went together the last time you came.
28,2022-07-27,29," **Interviewer**: Oh, yeah. I remember (laughs). \[100 meters\] We saw some boats and people drying fish. (Laughs) is it also where you get drinking water?", **Interviewee**: We get drinking water from the lake as well.
28,2022-07-27,30," **Interviewer**: Oh, thanks. What were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: The first time they came, they told us that we would start cooking using biogas, so we were very excited. We also expected to cook with ease like modern or advance people. So, it was a privilege because it's not a lot of people who cook using modern methods. We also expected to save and protect the environment."
28,2022-07-27,31, **Interviewer**: I have to say you are very concerned about protecting and conserving the environment....," **Interviewee**: Yes, right now I am just coming in from my nursery tree site. I have small trees, which I intend to plant at some point to help bring back the environment."
28,2022-07-27,32, **Interviewer**: Where did you get this heart? Why are you so concerned about the environment?," **Interviewee**: I do not really know. But, I think it's about looking back in time. Back in the days, we had a lot of trees, and it hurts me a lot now to see that the world doesn't have trees anymore. I'm also concerned about the future generation, that if we continue cutting trees as we are doing, will they find any. Yeah, that's how I feel about the environment."
28,2022-07-27,33, **Interviewer**: Interesting! What were you told to expect by the installers? I have heard some saying they were told that there were going to get lighting and fertilizer from the digester. What were you told to expect?," **Interviewee**: They said something like that. They said that at some point they would come to make it produce light. But, at that particular time, they said they were installing it for cooking energy only. And, they never came after that to give us the materials to enable it to produce light. So, we never used it for lighting. They simply gave us the things you have seen; pipes, stove and the digester bag."
28,2022-07-27,34," **Interviewer**: Did they tell you when they were going to come to put lights for you, and what things they were going to bring to make that possible?", **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us the time when would come to do that. They didn't tell us also what materials would be required. They just said they were going put lights in the future.
28,2022-07-27,35," **Interviewer**: Okay, what kind of training were you given by the installers?", **Interviewee**: We had no training.
28,2022-07-27,36, **Interviewer**: Then how were you able to switch it on and off?," **Interviewee**: The time they were installing it, they called us to show us how to switch it on and off. They asked us to do what they did. We did and that is how we learned how to switch it on."
28,2022-07-27,37," **Interviewer**: Apart from switching it on and off, what else, did you learn? Or, what else did they show you?"," **Interviewee**: They told us how to prepare feedstock. They also taught us how to make a certain thing made of sticks to lay and weigh the bag down when there was little pressure. On top of the sticks, we did put heavy stones to add weight."
28,2022-07-27,38, **Interviewer**: You made this thing while they were still around?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we made it together."
28,2022-07-27,39, **Interviewer**: How prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were?," **Interviewee**: They told us that they were going to come again to train us, so that we could be conversant with it. But, they never came back."
28,2022-07-27,40, **Interviewer**: Oh?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
28,2022-07-27,41, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you go to the agriculture office to follow up?," **Interviewee**: The area agriculture officer was also part of the group. He used to stay where we visited together last time and found that he had moved. So, he was given a digester too. But, among the group, his digester was the one that failed first. He even had more issues than us (laughs)."
28,2022-07-27,42, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) it was tough!, **Interviewee**: (laughs) it was a new thing to him too.
28,2022-07-27,43, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: We used firewood and charcoal. That's our charcoal burner there. We also had an energy efficient woodstove, but it has broken not so long ago. We used to put one wood only to cook on it."
28,2022-07-27,44, **Interviewer**: Did it come with United Purpose?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. They had a project in one of the villages around. I think they taught them how to make the stoves. So, it was the people from that area, who sold us the stove."
28,2022-07-27,45, **Interviewer**: How much was it?, **Interviewee**: It was K1000 that time.
28,2022-07-27,46, **Interviewer**: So where were you getting the wood?, **Interviewee**: From a certain area.
28,2022-07-27,47, **Interviewer**: Where exactly?, **Interviewee**: It is place that far side.
28,2022-07-27,48," **Interviewer**: Do you buy charcoal? Or, you make it yourself?", **Interviewee**: We buy; we do not make ourselves.
28,2022-07-27,49," **Interviewer**: how many bags of charcoal were you using thattime, and how much did the bag of charcoal cost?", **Interviewee**: That time charcoal was cheap; a bag was K3000.
28,2022-07-27,50," **Interviewer**: In a month, how many bags of charcoal were you using?", **Interviewee**: Two bags.
28,2022-07-27,51, **Interviewer**: How much is a bag of charcoal now?, **Interviewee**: It's K5500.
28,2022-07-27,52," **Interviewer**: Eh, where do you get wood now?", **Interviewee**: From a far place.
28,2022-07-27,53, **Interviewer**: Is it at mountain?," **Interviewee**: Sometimes we go to the mountains, yeah. However, the mountain now is bare; we do not find wood no more. If you can look around, you can't tell me where you can firewood now. It is all gone. Now we are just using maize stalks."
28,2022-07-27,54, **Interviewer**: What challenges do encounter when gathering wood?," **Interviewee**: Wood is scarce these days. It is very hard to find. And, when we go to get wood, the owners of the land refuse to share wood. So, we meet resistance from the people, and not the forest guys - there are no forest officers where we get wood."
28,2022-07-27,55, **Interviewer**: What is the difference of cooking on biogas and on charcoal or firewood?, **Interviewee**: Biogas is slow. It produces fire with weak flames.
28,2022-07-27,56," **Interviewer**: But, I thought you could always increase intensity of the fire with a control knob....", **Interviewee**: We did not know where to increase intensity of the fire on the stove. We only knew how to turn it on and off. We were only told how to switch it on and off (laughs). They did not show us the control knob for adjusting fire intensity.
28,2022-07-27,57, **Interviewer**: (laughs) Maybe you were using it while the volume was on one instead of five.," **Interviewee**: \[goes to get the stove\] this is where we were turning it on and off. The gas itself was always cool. When we did put a hand on the stove to feel the gas, it was cool. But once, it was light up with a matchstick, the flame was hot."
28,2022-07-27,58," **Interviewer**: The problem could not be you or the stove; the problem could be that your digester was simply producing little gas. Okay, you had cows and goats, and you I can see you still have them. How did you manage feedstock before the intervention?"," **Interviewee**: We were just leaving cow manure in the cow house. Sometimes some people would come to collect the manure. For example, cottage owners would come to collect manure for landscaping purpose, to make the grass greener. Farmers also used to come to apply it in their farms. And, even ourselves we used to take the manure to the farm especially during rainy season. Sometimes, we were just throwing it away."
28,2022-07-27,59, **Interviewer**: Did you sell the manure to the farmers or the cottage owners?," **Interviewee**: No, we were just giving them free. We have never sold manure. Some weeks back, some people came to get my manure for their trees. But, we've heard that some people do sell manure."
28,2022-07-27,60,"Cow manure is fertilizer, why do you let fertilizer go for free?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs heavily) we are just happy when it is out of our cow house. But I can see us selling soon because most people won't have fertilizer... But, we give for free because when it's there we hire people to get it out since it\`s a nuisance to the cows. So, when we see people coming to remove for free, we are happy because it saves us money that would have been paid to hire workers (laughs)."
28,2022-07-27,61," **Interviewer**: (laughs) I see. So you also take the manure to your farm, right?"," **Interviewee**: This year we do not even have a choice. And, we were talking about that too some days back, that we should start taking the manure to the farm in August."
28,2022-07-27,62,How much manure do you make from a cow house?, **Interviewee**: We get 100kg.
28,2022-07-27,63, **Interviewer**: In what period?, **Interviewee**: In 2 months.
28,2022-07-27,64," **Interviewer**: Okay, let's talk about how it worked. You said on the first day, you helped them to prepare feedstock by collecting manure, water and all that, to feed the digester and start it up. How much feedstock did you start it with?", **Interviewee**: We started with 6 bags of cow manure and 6 drums of water.
28,2022-07-27,65, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up?," **Interviewee**: After feeding, it with all that, I think it took five days for the bag to fill. Then, I notified them that the bag was fully inflated and they told me that they were going to come. When they came, they put the pipes, assembled the stove, and started it up. They showed us how to switch it on, and that was the only thing we comprehended. Then, asked us to switch it on, and it work, while they were taking photo and videos. It even started flushing out digestate before they came."
28,2022-07-27,66," **Interviewer**: After you called them, how long did it take them to come?", **Interviewee**: It took a week I think.
28,2022-07-27,67," **Interviewer**: So, we can say it took two weeks to start it. Okay, what were the operation requirements?"," **Interviewee**: It required cow manure and sometimes food leftovers. So, instead of throwing away food waste we used to feed the digester with that to keep it running."
28,2022-07-27,68, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: First, we were placing cow manure in the bucket, and then add water. Then, we were mixing like this \[shows hand movement\] with hands. After that, we were pouring the feedstock into the digester bag."
28,2022-07-27,69, **Interviewer**: You didn't feel disgusting or gross?," **Interviewee**: No, the installers were the first ones to do that, so I didn't feel bad.... I mean they were like have you seen what we did, can you do that. So, we just followed suit."
28,2022-07-27,70," **Interviewer**: oh, I see. You have said you had 5 cows and 20 cows. But, your talk has been on cow manure. Did you use goat manure to make feedstock?"," **Interviewee**: No, we just used cow manure."
28,2022-07-27,71, **Interviewer**: Why not?, **Interviewee**: We were not told. They just said we could use cow manure. I heard the same people came a year before with different digesters. For those ones I think they told people to use goat manure.
28,2022-07-27,72, **Interviewer**: You didn't get the first ones?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we didn't get those."
28,2022-07-27,73," **Interviewer**: But, you always had goat manure that time?", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
28,2022-07-27,74," **Interviewer**: So, how did you use goat manure?", **Interviewee**: We were just throwing them away
28,2022-07-27,75," **Interviewer**: Okay, how many people did use the gas?", **Interviewee**: We were 9.
28,2022-07-27,76," **Interviewer**: After it started working, how often did you feed it and in what quantities?"," **Interviewee**: They just said that once we see little flames coming out on the burner, then we should feed it. It was more like cooking on firewood; once we saw that fire was dying, we were adding manure."
28,2022-07-27,77," **Interviewer**: At what times, were you getting little fire?"," **Interviewee**: it was most when there was no sunlight. If there was sunlight, it was producing strong fire."
28,2022-07-27,78, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock were you feeding it with?, **Interviewee**: Two buckets (20 liters) of manure.
28,2022-07-27,79, **Interviewer**: Water?," **Interviewee**: We were just adding water to that. We didn't have a specific measure because we were not told. So, we were simply looking at the thickness of the slurry."
28,2022-07-27,80," **Interviewer**: Okay, who was responsible for feeding it?", **Interviewee**: It was my wife and I.
28,2022-07-27,81, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the task of feeding it?," **Interviewee**: Some will say it was tiresome, so it is better use charcoal. Some will even say it was more tiresome than going around searching for firewood. But, I think when you compare it with charcoal, you will see that you need money to use charcoal. So, charcoal is not an option. So, the task was tough, but not as tough as going to the woods to find firewood."
28,2022-07-27,82, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: In regards to maintenance, we were not told anything. However, they left us their contacts. Unfortunately, I lost the contacts as my phone was stolen."
28,2022-07-27,83," **Interviewer**: Oh, sorry!", **Interviewee**: I lost your contacts too as my other phone was stolen as well.
28,2022-07-27,84," **Interviewer**: Oh, we have many thieves in this community, uh?"," **Interviewee**: There is a lot of hustling at the lake. We have lots of people there, so when you drop a phone you just know it's gone. I got your number back when you called yesterday. That is why I was even asking who it was."
28,2022-07-27,85," **Interviewer**: Good that you have a new one; communication is important, what were you supposed to do in case of a malfunction?"," **Interviewee**: If they had told us about maintenance, then it would have been working today. I am sure, my wife and I would have been helping each other on its maintenance. So, since we were not trained, the only solution was to liaise with the agriculture officers. I recall one time; a digester of one of the beneficiaries broke at the gas connector and they fix it for her."
28,2022-07-27,86, **Interviewer**: You know nothing stay forever. Why didn't you ask them about maintenance issues?, **Interviewee**: We thought they were going to stick around for some time.
28,2022-07-27,87, **Interviewer**: Let us talk about how it performance. How much did it produce? How much cooking time did you get?," **Interviewee**: We used to cook around noon, if the bag was full. Sometimes, we used to cook late afternoon too."
28,2022-07-27,88, **Interviewer**: Why weren't you cooking on it in the morning?," **Interviewee**: In the morning, the bag was not always full, so we were getting little fire not enough to cook on."
28,2022-07-27,89, **Interviewer**: Did it meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: During that time, we would cook things. We would cook nsima and side dish \[45 -- 90 minutes\]. Sometimes, when the bag was not full, we could not manage to cook nsima or dish side. Sometimes, fire was going off whilst cooking, so we would find other alternatives to finish."
28,2022-07-27,90, **Interviewer**: What alternatives?, **Interviewee**: We would set fire on charcoal or firewood.
28,2022-07-27,91," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were the challenges?", **Interviewee**: It started leaking at the gas connector. I think that was the only challenge we faced.
28,2022-07-27,92, **Interviewer**: How did the problem manifest?, **Interviewee**: We could see bubbles or water coming outat the gas connector.
28,2022-07-27,93," **Interviewer**: Once the biogas broke, what did you do?"," **Interviewee**: There was nothing we could have done because we didn't know anything. We thought that if we would do anything, then we could make the problem worse."
28,2022-07-27,94, **Interviewer**: How long did you use it before it stopped working?, **Interviewee**: It took two months; the first month we used it without problems.
28,2022-07-27,95, **Interviewer**: When this happened what did you do?," **Interviewee**: We reported the issue to the agriculture office. They came and told us that they couldn't manage to solve the problem, but the installers. Then, they disassembled the pipes, stove, and told us to keep the equipment safe. However, they left the bag in the hole."
28,2022-07-27,96, **Interviewer**: Did you feed it after that?," **Interviewee**: After removing the equipment, we never fed it again. There was no point of feeding it because it was of no use."
28,2022-07-27,97, **Interviewer**: How long did it take the gas connector to break down?," **Interviewee**: After a month and some days, I think."
28,2022-07-27,98," **Interviewer**: (laughs) suppose you were giving something like this. For example, it tells you if there is a leakage, do this and do that. What do you think of this information and could it have helped?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, the information would have helped because I could have helped us to find the causes of the problems and their solutions."
28,2022-07-27,99," **Interviewer**: But it's in English, can you read?"," **Interviewee**: yeah, I know how to read."
28,2022-07-27,100," **Interviewer**: So, it would have helped?", **Interviewee**: Very much.
28,2022-07-27,101," **Interviewer**: So, if you had this we would have been talking about a different story?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, if we had that, then we could have accepted that we were responsible for its failure. And, if it could have failed, it would have been because of a huge problem. Not a small one as the one had\... And, I\`m sure, we could have managed to solve the problems which are on these papers."
28,2022-07-27,102, **Interviewer**: So you think you're not responsible for its failure.," **Interviewee**: The problem is the installers because they did not give us the expertise to manage the digester. If we were only told when you have this problem do this and do that, or if we had booklet like this, then we could have managed it."
28,2022-07-27,103, **Interviewer**: Today is 27^th^ of July. How would you describe your digester today?," **Interviewee**: It's dead; we can't say it's working, no!"
28,2022-07-27,104, **Interviewer**: It's completely dead?," **Interviewee**: I'm saying it's dead because we are not using it. Maybe if they can do some major rehabilitation work, it can work again. Maybe if the installers can come and work on it, then it can work. - It's a maybe though. But, we can't say the digester bag was punctured no, it's not. The digester bag is okay."
28,2022-07-27,105, **Interviewer**: Do you have the equipment?," **Interviewee**: We have all the equipment except for one bottle, which had sand like things in it. And, I don't even think it's completely missing. I think if we can search around the house then we can find it."
28,2022-07-27,106," **Interviewer**: So you have everything intact. Okay. In your opinion, how did it reach this state?"," **Interviewee**: The problem is we did not receive expertise to manage it; they only told us how to use it in the hole, but not how to fix any problem. Had it been that we received training, I'm sure we wouldn't have had any problems... Only one person received training though, and it was after she was given another digester before these one. But, when she was given the out the second digesters, she didn't receive training as the rest of us."
28,2022-07-27,107," **Interviewer**: If new digesters can be given to people, and then train the people, do you think in 5 or 10 years, they would be working?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, no doubt. What can stop us is death (laughs)."
28,2022-07-27,108," **Interviewer**: Now, that it is not working how do you meet you energy needs?"," **Interviewee**: It's what we have said basically, we use firewood and charcoal. Now, we are using maize stalks and cobs."
28,2022-07-27,109," **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. You have told me you don\'t know how much money was involved, but it\'s a lot, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
28,2022-07-27,110, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: No, nothing. Nothing at all."
28,2022-07-27,111, **Interviewer**: Cement?," **Interviewee**: No, the hole was not lined with a brick wall. However, at first they told us that the hole needed to be lined, so we sourced some bricks. But at the end, they told us that they would not line it."
28,2022-07-27,112, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: We do not know. Maybe, they came up with a new plan. Moreover, we wouldn't have asked then why."
28,2022-07-27,113, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the bricks?, **Interviewee**: We had the bricks.
28,2022-07-27,114," **Interviewer**: Okay, who is supposed to provide the cement to line it up?", **Interviewee**: They said they were going to provide.
28,2022-07-27,115," **Interviewer**: OK, you said you did the digging, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
28,2022-07-27,116, **Interviewer**: How many people installed it?," **Interviewee**: It was two people, and they came with the district agriculture officer. Then, some other people came on the day of its installation. I think it was the boss, who assembled it."
28,2022-07-27,117, **Interviewer**: You are talking about two different days?," **Interviewee**: The two people and the DO \[agriculture officer\] came on the day we dug it. On the day of installation, many people came. I think they came with 3 cars. It was a lot of people."
28,2022-07-27,118, **Interviewer**: It was more of a function or ceremony., **Interviewee**: Yeah (laugh). People were taking videos and all that.
28,2022-07-27,119, **Interviewer**: Only to last for 30 days or so.," **Interviewee**: Yeah. The gas connector that got broken, and that was it. The part looks like where you pump air into a car or bicycle. It is that part!"
28,2022-07-27,120, **Interviewer**: What kind of special items had to be imported from another country?, **Interviewee**: This stove looks like it from Malawi. The bag I don't know if it's from Malawi or not.
28,2022-07-27,121, **Interviewer**: Can we find the digester bag in Mangochi?, **Interviewee**: No.
28,2022-07-27,122, **Interviewer**: Blantyre?," **Interviewee**: No, it is not from Malawi. However, let us not rush to conclude it is from another country.... The bag was not even written where it was manufactured."
28,2022-07-27,123, **Interviewer**: Did the digester save you any money in terms of energy consumption?," **Interviewee**: Yes, because we did not buy any charcoal around that time. Of course, we were not using all the times, but the money we were spending around that time was not as before."
28,2022-07-27,124, **Interviewer**: How much money do you think you saved that time?," **Interviewee**: Maybe, we saved K6000. We use two bags of charcoal a month, and we used it for a month or so. The price of charcoal was K3000 a month then. If it was now, we could have saved K11000 or K12000."
28,2022-07-27,125," **Interviewer**: Oh, that is a lot of cash. What is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: We want biogas again, and we want it work this time."
28,2022-07-27,126, **Interviewer**: Why? Is it good?," **Interviewee**: It is good especially when you think of where we are going. We are going to an era where trees are going to be very scarce. Therefore, we do not know what will happen. Secondly, I would be very happy if we can have the privilege of having wonder bag. It is a very good thing to have. It is makes life easy. You do not need to be there to boost the fire after ignition. You just leave the beans there and go to the farm. You do not worry if the beans will get cooked or not because you are sure you will find them cooked."
28,2022-07-27,127, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: The way the project was run here; one is inclined to think that it has no future. But, if the people were given skills to run the digester, I'm sure you could have found them working today. And, I'm sure many people would have adopted it in their houses. People were coming to admire it here. This house was full of visitors, who were coming just to see it. So, I'm sure if it had worked as expected then many people would have got it. Some would have even been willing to pay for it. Just like people are buying solar panels now.... I liked it because the flame was clean. The pot stays clean as if it was not on fire. It can even prolong the life span of pots because there is no need of cleaning it up with sand and all."
28,2022-07-27,128," **Interviewer**: I think you have answered me this one, still I am going to ask you. If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I would have gone for wonder bag. I could also go for biogas, only if it is done in a different way."
28,2022-07-27,129, **Interviewer**: What do you mean?," **Interviewee**: We need a durable digester that would not break in a month; we need training, and the project implementers need to follow up to offer support to the users."
28,2022-07-27,130," **Interviewer**: Great, in closing, what are your last words?"," **Interviewee**: I will just urge people to continue using biogas to save environment, and be modern people. That other thing about biogas is that it gives you freedom because [biogas stoves provide instant heat upon ignition and that is very important. When you have biogas its like, you have a water tap at your house. For a person in life to have a peace of mind, he needs to have a modern technology of cooking and safe water. So, if it could be done in a different way, then we would be willing to accept it. The other thing is that we are old, and the environment is dying, so in the near future will be able to meet energy needs with firewood. So, we need biogas because it is easy to use; you can you even ask a child to help you make feedstock, and cook. So biogas needs to continue.]{.mark}"
28,2022-07-27,131, [**Interviewer**: Thanks for the interview.]{.mark},NA
29,2022-08-14,1,"Thanks for granting us a phone interview. What came to your house today last time but we did not find you. Again, we went to your previous house in Mbwadzulu were the digester was installed, but we found that you had moved to Nankumba, and that's when we came to your house in Nankumba. I heard you are an extension worker, which is a good thing because most people we talked to were mere beneficiaries. So, we hope to learn more and get a different perspective in regards to biogas. First question, where did the digester originate from?"," **Interviewee**: I know that it came from Minister of Energy. At that time, they were implementing a pilot project concerning renewable energy. Therefore, biogas was one component of the project. But, main components of the project were efficient stove and briquette making."
29,2022-08-14,2," **Interviewer**: So, it was more of an environmental project?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was at a renewable energy project, and biogas testing and installation was one part of it."
29,2022-08-14,3, **Interviewer**: Who designed the digester?," **Interviewee**: Initially, we tried a locally made digester. It was made of a thick ordinary plastic digester bag. Two ends of the digester bag were tied to pipes, one acting as an inlet and outlet. We placed the bag in a shallow hole. So, this one was designed by people from Energy Affairs. Sadly, this one did not work. Then, after a year or so, they brought a different digester. They said it was imported from China, and this one to some extent worked."
29,2022-08-14,4," **Interviewer**: Who built the digesters? First, let us look at the first digester, and then the second one."," **Interviewee**: It has been a long so I do not know who really built it. However, I remember that the first one was a locally made digester by people from Energy Affairs. I do not really remember when it came, but I think it was 2017 or 2018. And, it preceded the second digester by a year or so."
29,2022-08-14,5," **Interviewer**: You have said the first one was a failure, what do you mean?"," **Interviewee**: It never produced fire; it never worked out. And, I can say what we learnt about biogas that time was a waste."
29,2022-08-14,6," **Interviewer**: What did you learn? And, why do say that?"," **Interviewee**: We learned about its operation; we learned that to work it needs fresh cow manure; and that we were supposed to feed it every morning with fresh cow manure; we also learned that gas move from the digester bag to the pipes, and then to the stove. However, the first digester had a different stove from the second one. The first one had a stove made by local artisans, but the second digester had a stove that looked factory made. It had also other improvements, for example, it had a bottle for gas purification."
29,2022-08-14,7, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to build the first digester and the second one?," **Interviewee**: It took a day to build the first one. But, the second one took long because the hole took long to dig. However, the task of digging was responsibility of the beneficiary. So, some people hired people to dig for them to speed up the process... In addition, of course, before we commenced any work, we had one-day training. So, we did what was discussed in the training."
29,2022-08-14,8, **Interviewer**: Okay! What was your role?," **Interviewee**: My role as a beneficiary was to dig the hole for the digester, and to feed the digester daily after its installation. Also, whatever we were doing was exemplary because it was a project for community members to learn and adopt the technology of biogas."
29,2022-08-14,9, **Interviewer**: How were you selected as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: The first consideration to be chosen as it beneficiary was that the person had the potential to source fresh cow manure. So, the first requisite was that the beneficiary was supposed to have cows. On top of the first consideration, the person was supposed to have interest in the digester and the commitment to feed it. Thirdly, the beneficiary was to be a person who was using firewood or charcoal for cooking. This was not a big issue because every person was expected to be using firewood or charcoal. Thus, because the project was intended to stop people from using firewood or charcoal and to enjoy the benefits of biogas, the beneficiary was supposed to be a charcoal or firewood user at all cost."
29,2022-08-14,10, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I did not know anything. I knew about biogas during the one-day training."
29,2022-08-14,11," **Interviewer**: I believe many people were eligible to get a digester, so how was the selection process?","As area extension workers, we chose an implementation area, and then we engaged the community people to brief them about the project. During the engagement meetings with the community, people were selecting those who they thought would manage the digesters bearing in mind the work that was involved. Of course, we had a limit of beneficiaries. I think in Mbwadzulu 6 people were chosen."
29,2022-08-14,12," **Interviewer**: Yeah, you are right. I think it was five or six people."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was five people. So, I can say the selection process was community led with people considering the work required. In addition, it was more of a self-selection process as some people removed themselves voluntarily saying that they would not manage."
29,2022-08-14,13, **Interviewer**: So was it like the whole community was there?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it was the whole village. For example, Mbwadzulu village chose five people."
29,2022-08-14,14,"Okay, okay. But, you were not chosen through that process since you were an extension worker, I suppose.","Yeah, yeah after choosing themselves, they decided that one should be installed at the agriculture office to see if the digester really works."
29,2022-08-14,15,(laughs) okay," **Interviewee**: (laughs) Yeah, for others to see, learn, and appreciate if it\`s practical. So, it was more like a demo, and in fact, before the beneficiaries were given the digester they learned from that digester."
29,2022-08-14,16, **Interviewer**: What did the people learn?," **Interviewee**: Basically, they learnt that the digestate is fertilizer. They also learnt how to make feedstock for the digester."
29,2022-08-14,17,"So, was it given to agriculture office or to you as an individual?","The plan was to install it at agriculture office. But questions were raised that if it was to be installed at agriculture office, then who was going to use it. Then, that's when they decided to plant it at my house. So, I can say it was planted at my house because they wanted a specific person to feed and use it."
29,2022-08-14,18,"So, how many people were there at agriculture office then, and why did they choose you out of all people?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) the other extension workers just said that it should be installed at ""the bosses' house""."
29,2022-08-14,19," **Interviewer**: (laughs) oh, because you are the boss...."," **Interviewee**: (laughs) Yeah, also because out of the two agriculture extensional workers who attended the training, I was the one who was staying closer to the office. The other one was staying in the field at Sawuya. So, I can say I was chosen because I was the one living closest to the agriculture office and who had knowledge about it."
29,2022-08-14,20, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: As a charcoal user, I expected to stop using charcoal. So, my biggest expectation was that I was going to start cooking without spending money. So, yeah, that was my biggest expectation."
29,2022-08-14,21, **Interviewer**: What were you told to expect by the installers?," **Interviewee**: Nothing, that was all. But, personally, I also expected other people to learn and adopt it. In my heart, I did not think the digester was mine, but it was for community and for educational purposes. And, for the second digester from China, the installers said that if the digesters worked more digesters would be given to people at a subsidized price."
29,2022-08-14,22, **Interviewer**: You said that to be a beneficiary one was supposed to have cow. As an organization or as a person how many cows did you have?," **Interviewee**: Even now, we still have cows, and as matter of fact, every EPA \[Extension Planning Area\] has cows. That time we had 10 cows."
29,2022-08-14,23, **Interviewer**: That was a lot., **Interviewee**: And now we have 14 cows.
29,2022-08-14,24," **Interviewer**: You talked about training, what kind of training did you receive?"," **Interviewee**: At first, we learned about renewable energy in general. Then as subtopics, we learned about briquettes, energy efficient stove making, solar installation and biogas."
29,2022-08-14,25, **Interviewer**: What did you learn about biogas?," **Interviewee**: Basically, it was about cooking. They told us that when we use biogas for cooking, we conserve the environment, as it doesn't need firewood. So, instead of cooking using firewood, cow manure that is regarded as waste and useless would be used. After that, we proceeded to install a digester."
29,2022-08-14,26," **Interviewer**: Okay, so it was more of theory and practical?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, it was a bit of both. I mean, after the training, we installed a solar system at Mlambe School in Nankumba. On top of that, we also made briquettes from papers. Then, we also did a small demo on biogas. So, it was both theory and practical."
29,2022-08-14,27, **Interviewer**: What did you do or learn during biogas practical?," **Interviewee**: We learnt about its installation, for example, how to assemble the pipes and digester bag, and how to make feedstock."
29,2022-08-14,28," **Interviewer**: How many people attended the training? And, how long did the training take?"," **Interviewee**: They got 2 EPAs from Nankumba T/A. There was Mbwadzulu and Nankumba EPA. If I am not mistaken, two agriculture extension workers from each EPA were taken. Also, one community development assistant and forest worker from each EPA was taken. The training was conducted at Nankumba EPA and it was for one week. Our team from Mbwadzulu was transported to Mbwadzulu by installers. At the end of the training, we went to the field to install a digester of the beneficiaries\' house. In addition, we installed a solar panel and made briquettes. I remember that time trainers brought equipment, which looked more like a compressor for making of briquettes."
29,2022-08-14,29," **Interviewer**: So the training was for extension workers and other stakeholders. Did you have training with the beneficiary? Or, did the beneficiaries have any type of training?"," **Interviewee**: I was the facilitator for beneficiaries training; so, I was simply telling them what I was told during the training, which was about feedstock preparation and how to operate it. I was also responsible for installation of their digesters."
29,2022-08-14,30," **Interviewer**: So after the training, how prepared to run or operate the digester did you feel you were?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, I felt confident. Of course, the digester did not work, but I feel we were not the problem. The trainers were a problem because they failed to make the digester to produce fire. I think there was a deficiency somewhere. I do feel like the digester was not air tight enough."
29,2022-08-14,31," **Interviewer**: How did you feel when the installers came to digester and failed to produce fire? And, what did the installers say?"," **Interviewee**: As for us, we lost hope and thought that the things do not work. And, it being our vey first digester, it was demoralizing. But, the installers gave reasons why it didn't work. They said it had too many connections that were connected by flat rubber strips. So, they felt that the connections were not airtight enough. The other thing was that gas was coming to the burners with moist. So, that was making the gas not to light up with flame."
29,2022-08-14,32, **Interviewer**: Why did the gas produce moist?," **Interviewee**: When I compared the first and second digester, I observed that ""dew"" like things (moist) appeared at the burners. So, I think moist was making it not to light up. So, maybe the burner or system itself did not have things to control moist."
29,2022-08-14,33," **Interviewer**: So the first one failed, and they said they were going to come back?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, they said they were going to come back, and they did. They said they had come with a new digester that was like big as a 200-liter drum. So, even the design for the hole changed. The hole for the first digester was more like a drain, while the second one was a deep hole like dug well -- so they advised us to digging a round 1 meter hole for it."
29,2022-08-14,34, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to bring the second the digesters?, **Interviewee**: It did not take a year. I think it took about six months.
29,2022-08-14,35," **Interviewer**: So, when they brought the second one, you were able to make it work?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it worked. But, as a user, it didn't really meet my expectations, because I was not able to use the gas the whole day. Best-case scenario, I was unable to breakfast and lunch. In the evening, it did not have gas."
29,2022-08-14,36, **Interviewer**: How much cooking time did you get in the morning and afternoon?," **Interviewee**: In the morning, I was able to make breakfast for the kids. At noon, I was able to nsima and side dish of beans without problems. So it was a matter of preference at times, sometimes we opted to cook on it in the evening instead at lunch."
29,2022-08-14,37," **Interviewer**: Why do think you were not able to use it in the morning, at lunch and in the evening?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, after installation, they never came back. But, if they had come, I wanted to suggest to them that it needed a storage gas to work the whole day. I think it was not efficient enough because gas was coming from the digester to the burners directly. I am also saying this because I could smell gas around the digester, and it made me think that we were losing gas. So. I think that if we had storage bags, then we could have managed to conserve the gas."
29,2022-08-14,38," **Interviewer**: I'm curious to know, the first digest that you tried and failed, did you install them in the community as well?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, they also installed them in the community."
29,2022-08-14,39, **Interviewer**: Did they work there?," **Interviewee**: No. But after feeding the digester bags, the bags did get inflated. The only challenge was only that the burners could not produce fire at the stove."
29,2022-08-14,40, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: As for me, I can say I was using charcoal."
29,2022-08-14,41," **Interviewer**: In a month, how many bags of charcoal did you use?", **Interviewee**: Two bags of charcoal.
29,2022-08-14,42, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the charcoal?, **Interviewee**: I buy from charcoal sellers who move around.
29,2022-08-14,43, **Interviewer**: How much did a bag cost?, **Interviewee**: That time a bag of 50kg of charcoal was K2000.
29,2022-08-14,44, **Interviewer**: How much is it now?, **Interviewee**: Now with the way the price of commodities have gone up it is K5000 or K6000.
29,2022-08-14,45," **Interviewer**: Okay, you said you use the digester for a certain time, so during that time, were you still using charcoal?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, I was. However, I was using less charcoal then."
29,2022-08-14,46, **Interviewer**: Like how?," **Interviewee**: I was only using one bag of charcoal a month. Sometimes, I was using a bag for one month and some days. Therefore, it was helping especially in the morning as it was faster than charcoal."
29,2022-08-14,47, **Interviewer**: How do you differentiate cooking on biogas and on charcoal?, **Interviewee**: The food taste is the same. It is just that it is faster than charcoal.
29,2022-08-14,48, **Interviewer**: What was biggest difference change in your life the time you were using biogas?," **Interviewee**: Cooking with biogas was more like cooking on an electric stove because it's clean. So, you don't clean pots after cooking; the pot does get dirty because of soot. In addition, biogas is fast. Within an hour, you do a lot of cooking. You get fire upon ignition. You do not wait for the fire to kindle. So, it was time saving!"
29,2022-08-14,49," **Interviewer**: You said you had 10 cows, so how did you manage your feedstock or cow manure before the intervention?", **Interviewee**: People were coming to collect and use it in their farms - There was nothing else besides that.
29,2022-08-14,50," **Interviewer**: When you say people, which people are you talking about?", **Interviewee**: The people from the surrounding community were coming to collect and use it in their farms.
29,2022-08-14,51," **Interviewer**: Okay, I thought it was only for the stuff...."," **Interviewee**: No, it was for everyone."
29,2022-08-14,52, **Interviewer**: Did you sell your cow manure?, **Interviewee**: No
29,2022-08-14,53," **Interviewer**: (laughs) ah, that's not common with government workers...",(laughs) That \[Mbwadzulu\] area is different from other areas.
29,2022-08-14,54, **Interviewer**: Why or how?," **Interviewee**: The people there do not consider it as a valuable thing. They do not know it's ""gold"" (laughs). So, I don't think people can buy it there!"
29,2022-08-14,55, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you use to start it up?," **Interviewee**: For the first digester, I don't think I will be accurate. I think you used five buckets (20 liters) of fresh manure."
29,2022-08-14,56, **Interviewer**: How much water?," **Interviewee**: I have forgotten the ratio. But, we were just waiting for the feedstock to get to suitable slurry. So, I think added 2 or 3 buckets of water to one bucket of cow manure."
29,2022-08-14,57," **Interviewer**: And at the end, it did not work at all?", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
29,2022-08-14,58," **Interviewer**: What about the second one, how much manure and water did you use to start it up?"," **Interviewee**: For the second one, we used the 10 buckets of cow manure. To this, we added about 100 liters of water."
29,2022-08-14,59, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up?, **Interviewee**: It took three days.
29,2022-08-14,60," **Interviewer**: Okay, where did you get the water?", **Interviewee**: We had a borehole close to the office.
29,2022-08-14,61, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning? You mentioned that you used to cook in the morning and at lunch or in the evening.... How much cooking time did you get?," **Interviewee**: I think it was 2 hour of cooking time.... In the morning, we would cook sweet potatoes; boil water for tea -- and everything else to do with breakfast. At lunch, we would cook nsima, dish side vegetables or fish. But, if you didn't feed it, you couldn't cook... And, this one was releasing digestate at one of the pipes especially in the afternoon. They said the digestate could be used as fertilizer for crops and vegetables. So, at the outlet we dug a hole for digestate collection. Thus, after collecting digestate from the hole we used it at the garden\.... So I can say it worked okay...."
29,2022-08-14,62, **Interviewer**: Were people coming to get the digestate as well?," **Interviewee**: No, people were not coming to get the digestate."
29,2022-08-14,63, **Interviewer**: Why do you think people were not coming to get it? Was it not enough?," **Interviewee**: It looked useless, except for people who knew it. It also looked disgusting and unhygienic to some. It also looked nasty and it gave a certain smell."
29,2022-08-14,64," **Interviewer**: Is it wrong to say you failed the people in that regard? I mean, the digester was for educational purposes and you were purpose to teach them about the digestate."," **Interviewee**: (laughs) but I tried my best to tell them that it's fertilizer, it's just that they didn't accept it."
29,2022-08-14,65, **Interviewer**: How did you use the gas?, **Interviewee**: It was only for cooking.
29,2022-08-14,66, **Interviewer**: How many were you in your family that time?, **Interviewee**: We were five.
29,2022-08-14,67," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were the operation requirements?"," **Interviewee**: For it to work, it needed to be fed every morning with fresh manure. If it was not fed, it did not work."
29,2022-08-14,68, **Interviewer**: Only fresh manure from cattle?," **Interviewee**: During the training, they only told us about fresh cow manure."
29,2022-08-14,69, **Interviewer**: Why was it only fresh cow manure?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) Mmh, we didn't even ask."
29,2022-08-14,70," **Interviewer**: So it was fresh cow manure and water, I suppose?", **Interviewee**: Yes!
29,2022-08-14,71, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: Every morning, we used to go to the cow house to collect fresh cow manure. Then, we would you put the manure in a bucket, add water and then mix it. After mixing, we were pouring the feedstock it into the digester bag through a funnel into inlet pipe. Then, the following day we would also do the same. So with that process, we were able to cook breakfast and lunch."
29,2022-08-14,72, **Interviewer**: How often did you feed it?, **Interviewee**: We used to feed it with a 20 kgs of feedstock and 40 liters of water.
29,2022-08-14,73, **Interviewer**: Was it daily or after two or three days?, **Interviewee**: It was daily!
29,2022-08-14,74, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: The whole family was responsible for feeding it. If was not around, they fed it because without feeding it they could get gas for cooking."
29,2022-08-14,75, **Interviewer**: Did it ever happen that you failed to get gas because you didn't feed?," **Interviewee**: Yes, some day they felt lazy to feed it, and it did not work. This other time, I moved for two days and they did not feed it. I do not know what made them lazy not to feed it. So, the bag collapsed completely. So, it took us another 10 buckets of manure to feed it and start it up, as we did in the beginning. It took 3 days to pick up. But, yeah, the digester bag was always inflated when it was fed."
29,2022-08-14,76," **Interviewer**: You said this other time you left, they didn't feed it, why? Is feed it challenge?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, it's hard work. But, when you consider the benefits, it's worth feeding. So, for someone who is lazy and not committed it's a very tough job. It also needs someone who doesn't get easily disgusted because it's not a pleasant thing to handle manure.... So, in general, it's very hard to feed it on a daily basis."
29,2022-08-14,77," **Interviewer**: Aah, can some feel disgusted with cow manure?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, yes. It's not easy for a person who is not used to cow manure to make feedstock. Fresh cow manure is generally gross. And, it's better to handle goat manure than cow manure. Also, when you are handling it you use hands, so it's not pleasant."
29,2022-08-14,78," **Interviewer**: Oh, yeah. I have heard people used bare hands."," **Interviewee**: Of course, we were using hands. We used to mix with bare hands."
29,2022-08-14,79, **Interviewer**: Didn't community health personnel feel that it was not health? How did you feel?," **Interviewee**: There is always conflict of messages, you know. Everyone is saying their own thing to advance their agendas. Personally, I didn't feel gross. I was okay with that. And, I believe the people who were doing it, had no problem with it, because if they had a problem with it, they wouldn't have been doing it altogether. Also, they could have denied the digester in the first place."
29,2022-08-14,80, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?, **Interviewee**: Maintenance in terms of?
29,2022-08-14,81," **Interviewer**: Keeping it running, solving issues, and preventing breakages...."," **Interviewee**: Ah, the main issue was feeding. Its maintenance hinged on feeding."
29,2022-08-14,82," **Interviewer**: Didn't you think that one day it was going to malfunction? If you did, how were you supposed to handle the issue?"," **Interviewee**: I think we didn't discuss that part. I remember, when we started using it, they came to follow up, and they stopped following up. But, we did talk on the phone once when a pipe that was carrying gas from the digester to the stove started leaking. I asked them what I was supposed to do, but they didn't come. They just told us what to do. Then, we found a way of tightening the part, which was leaking with a flat rubber strip."
29,2022-08-14,83," **Interviewer**: So they didn't tell you where to get spare parts, and let alone how to solve issues?"," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't."
29,2022-08-14,84," **Interviewer**: I mean, if it failed, what would have happened?"," **Interviewee**: Like I said, after installation, I just felt like it could not develop any fault."
29,2022-08-14,85, **Interviewer**: (laughs) how? Why do you think that?," **Interviewee**: After installation, we couldn't think of anything else, but that it was working... I remember, when the digesters were working a Cabinet Minister came and visited the beneficiaries to appreciate the technology.... It's just that our mind was that once you feed a digester, you don't get any other problems."
29,2022-08-14,86," **Interviewer**: Oh, a cabinet minister came?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was a big thing!"
29,2022-08-14,87, **Interviewer**: Who was the Minister that time?," **Interviewee**: I have forgotten the name. But, I remember that it was during Peter Muthalika's era."
29,2022-08-14,88," **Interviewer**: You said it did not meet your needs, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it didn't meet my energy needs."
29,2022-08-14,89, **Interviewer**: What are your energy needs?," **Interviewee**: To cook in the morning, afternoon, and evening. So, with this one, I wasn't able to cook in the evening."
29,2022-08-14,90," **Interviewer**: And you feel like if you had a storage bag, then things could have worked out?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that's what I think. I mean, I could tell that the digester was losing gas by the smell that was around the bag too. And, they even told us that, if we smelled an odd smell, we should know that the bag was leaking. We checked all the pipes and connection, but they were all okay.... But, I feel like the bags was coming from somewhere around the bag."
29,2022-08-14,91, **Interviewer**: You knew that to meet your energy you needed gas storage bag. Why didn't you ask for a storage bag? Or why didn't you buy one?," **Interviewee**: I learned that after it stopped working. A friend of mine came and told me that he saw a similar digester in Zambia, but it had a storage bag for storing gas. He went on to say that, people do sell the gas. And, that's when the idea of a storage bag came. But, initially I thought that everything was ""normal""."
29,2022-08-14,92, **Interviewer**: What challenges did you encounter? You have talked about as it used to smell and you thought it was leaking gas. So what other challenges did you face?," **Interviewee**: We also had a problem with the smell of the slurry, which was coming out at the outlet. It had a bad smell. So, I think the distance between the digester bag and point of use should have been long enough. The other challenge was feeding it. It wasn't easy to feed it with fresh cow manure. I remember my friend who went to Zambia told me that it's possible to feed it with food waste. But, the installers didn't tell us that. They only mentioned fresh cow manure. So, it's was somewhat unhygienic to handle fresh cow manure."
29,2022-08-14,93, **Interviewer**: Why was the digestate producing smell when it is not supposed to be like that?," **Interviewee**: I think that as we were feeding it some of the new feedstock was overflowing, so that's why it was producing smell."
29,2022-08-14,94, **Interviewer**: How long did the second digester take to stop working?, **Interviewee**: It took about 5 months.
29,2022-08-14,95, **Interviewer**: How did it stop?," **Interviewee**: Gas production started to decrease with time. After some time, we could only prepare breakfast and side dish of vegetables. It could not produce enough gas to cook nsima. And, it was going off as we were cooking. We noticed this around the same time we found out the gas was leaking from the pipe. Then, we tighten the part that was leaking gas and it work for a short time. Then, it eventually stopped. After it is stopped working, we also stopped feeding it right away because there was no point of feeding it. Since that time, we never talked with the installers."
29,2022-08-14,96," **Interviewer**: So after it failed in 5 months, didn't call the installers?"," **Interviewee**: It wasn't as we were talking with them directly. The numbers we got were for the district environment officer from the district council. So, when I called him he was like people from energy affairs were going to come at some point, but they never came. So, he was simply relaying information, and he's the one that told us that the people from energy affairs suggested that we should tie the part, which was leaking with flat rubber strip. Then, after some time we gave up and abandoned it when we"
29,2022-08-14,97," **Interviewer**: So you were communicating with the person from the district assembly, and not the installers?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we were communicating with the person from the district council. He was like the focal person for the project."
29,2022-08-14,98," **Interviewer**: So, he was also communicating with other people above him?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
29,2022-08-14,99, **Interviewer**: That was a challenge too., **Interviewee**: Yeah. I also heard that they installed one in Mangochi. I don't know if you know if it is still working.
29,2022-08-14,100," **Interviewer**: Yeah, we followed up on that too before coming here. It's also not working; it failed some time back too. It's bad! Moving on, have you seen something like this \[table of intervention\]?", **Interviewee**: No.
29,2022-08-14,101, **Interviewer**: What do you think of the information and do you think it could have helped in your case?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it would have helped us a lot. The problem is that we were only relying on the information that was given to us through the training. And in all honesty and sincerity, it wasn't enough. There was nothing we learnt regarding maintenance. But, as you can clearly see, it's important. So, I believe this information, which is touching on maintenance, would have helped a lot. In addition, when we looked at the first digester, it was obvious that the accessories could be found in the local market. But, for the second digester from China, we had no idea where we could access the accessories. For example, the pipes, I have not seen one like that on the local market."
29,2022-08-14,102, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you asked them about where you could get the accessories for the second digester?," **Interviewee**: They told us not to worry because they were in the process of testing the digesters from China. So, we thought that at some point everything was going to be made clear."
29,2022-08-14,103, **Interviewer**: I see. What's the date today?, **Interviewee**: It is 14 August.
29,2022-08-14,104," **Interviewer**: Okay, How can you describe the state of your digester on 14^th^ of August 2022?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, it's dead."
29,2022-08-14,105, **Interviewer**: Is there hope that it can be revamped?," **Interviewee**: No, it can't be revamped. I mean after the digester failed, the rains started. As a result, soil was collapsing into the digester and the hole itself was covered in water. And, soil in Mbwadzulu is clay like, so after the place dried up, it buried the digester bag, as the hole since it was not lined. So that was the end of it. I think this couldn't have happened if the digester was working. I mean, it wouldn't have been possible for the bag to get buried when it was full of air. So, once it got buried that's the end of it!"
29,2022-08-14,106," **Interviewer**: Okay, I remember the time we came to your house, we tried to locate it but could not see it."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I hired some people to remove it. So, I used the digester bag to make a roof structure for my pigeon house. As for other accessories, I returned them to the agriculture office."
29,2022-08-14,107," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, what caused it to fail?"," **Interviewee**: It failed because there was no maintenance plan. For example, in our case when gas started leaking we could not find a lasting solution, so we stopped feeding it, and it died."
29,2022-08-14,108, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of our interview. We have about five or six questions. How do you meet your energy needs now that it is not working?, **Interviewee**: Now we have reverted to charcoal.
29,2022-08-14,109, **Interviewer**: And you are still buying from charcoal merchants?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
29,2022-08-14,110," **Interviewer**: The government has made amendments to the forest law. Now, if you are caught in possession of charcoal, you are guilty of offence and the punishment is 10 years."," **Interviewee**: Oh yeah, I have heard that."
29,2022-08-14,111," **Interviewer**: Then, how are you going to survive?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was talking with someone about that. I think that provision is a good, but I feel like the government hasn't offered people an alternative. Also, I think LPG gas is not publicized enough. People do not know it. So, they should publicize LPG gas. Still, I don't think it's enough. If you look at the LPG gas, it is found at Mangochi Council. So, I don't think it's practical for someone from here let alone from Monkey Bay to access the gas. And, you can't think of cooking on electric, it's not just practical."
29,2022-08-14,112, **Interviewer**: (laughs) why?, **Interviewee**: The power outages are just despicable; they go off for more than 8 hours every day.
29,2022-08-14,113," **Interviewer**: Yeah, it's too much."," **Interviewee**: So the government should have made LPG gas available before enacting that law... Also, my friend from Zambia told me that it's possible to build a community biogas plant and sell to the community at a reasonable price. So, I think if they can do that, then they can start talking about charcoal laws. And, let me go back to sensitization, my observation is that those who use charcoal are well to do people. I'm sure if they can publicize LPG gas more people who buy charcoal can adopt it and find it cheaper too."
29,2022-08-14,114, **Interviewer**: That's true. How do you manage your feed store now that it is not working?," **Interviewee**: We just get cow manure out of the cow house, and then gather it on one place. Then after sometime, we use it as fertilizer in our farms."
29,2022-08-14,115, **Interviewer**: Do people still come to get manure from your cow house for agriculture purposes?," **Interviewee**: Yes, they still do. And we are expecting the demand to rise, as people will find it tough to get fertilizer because number of beneficiaries for the AIP \[Agriculture Input Program/Subsidy Program\] program has drastically reduced."
29,2022-08-14,116," **Interviewer**: Yeah, it is going to be hard. How much did the reactor cost?", **Interviewee**: They did not tell us.
29,2022-08-14,117, **Interviewer**: So you don\'t know?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I don't know."
29,2022-08-14,118, **Interviewer**: Do you know who funded the project? Is it UNDP?," **Interviewee**: I think the project was funded by UNDP. But, initially the project was for Ministry of Energy. Then, later UNDP had a project on climate proofing and took over the project from Ministry of Energy."
29,2022-08-14,119, **Interviewer**: So the first digester was not UNDP\`s?," **Interviewee**: They didn't mention UNDP. So, I don't know if they were involved or not."
29,2022-08-14,120, **Interviewer**: Did you or your organization contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: I can only think of labor for digging as well as cow dung and water.
29,2022-08-14,121, **Interviewer**: How much labor was involved?, **Interviewee**: I hired three people to dig the hole for the digester.
29,2022-08-14,122, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay?, **Interviewee**: I paid them K5000.
29,2022-08-14,123, **Interviewer**: K5000 for all?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
29,2022-08-14,124, **Interviewer**: Who dug the hole for the first digester?," **Interviewee**: It was ground laborers from the office, who are responsible for feeding the cattle."
29,2022-08-14,125," **Interviewer**: Oh, you have special people who feed the cows?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we do."
29,2022-08-14,126, **Interviewer**: We have 4 or 5 questions to finish. You said you digester wasn't lined. Was there any masonry work involved?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
29,2022-08-14,127," **Interviewer**: I have talked to some people and have told me they lined their digesters. Some have told me they told them that they would line the hole with plaster but on the day of installation, the installers did not bring cement and all... What happened?"," **Interviewee**: There was no provision like that. They didn't tell me that. They just said it was better to line it the hole with plaster or a brick wall, and those who had the capacity should do so. But, they said that we shouldn't worry much about lining it because once the digester bag get full of air it's hard for water or soil to collapse into the hole and cover it like I said."
29,2022-08-14,128," **Interviewer**: Who built it? I mean, how many people from installation organization came?", **Interviewee**: It this it was 2 people.
29,2022-08-14,129, **Interviewer**: What special items that had to be important from another country?," **Interviewee**: When you saw the first digester, you knew they got the bag from PolyPack \[a plastic manufacture in Malawi\]. But, the second one didn't look Malawi-like. Also, it didn't look like they got the accessories from different vendors like the first. It was a set of accessories from one vendor. And, it was even written on the bag that it was from China."
29,2022-08-14,130, **Interviewer**: Can you say the digester saved you money the time it worked?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it did. But, it could have saved as more money if it worked all day because I would have cut all the spending on charcoal."
29,2022-08-14,131," **Interviewer**: Can you go to a shop and buy a digester now, and move away from using charcoal?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know where it is sold. Also, I feel like I didn't really see its benefit. I think I still need to be convinced. Also after acquiring one, I would need additional knowledge and skills on its operation and management. On top of that, I would need the digester bag to be placed farther away from my house because its digestate produces odor, which I found a nuisance. But, I think this may require the pipes to be very long, so it's better to have storage bags for harvesting gas to be used at the stove. So, for me to buy a digester, all the things I have outlined need to be addressed. I also had a debate about the length of the gas pipe. If I'm not mistaken, the installers mentioned that the pipes shouldn't be longer than 10 meters. This was a limitation on my part because I felt like the digester bag needed to be at least 20 meters away. I also feel I was lucky because cow manure wasn't a problem for me. I was having surplus manure. But, without cow manure nearby, then it\`s a problem."
29,2022-08-14,132," **Interviewer**: Okay. Okay, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: As a former user, I would say biogas is good. It's clean and I can't say it has any safety concerns. But, I think it needs improvements. Most of which I have mentioned, for example, the burners need to use gas from the storage bags and not direct from the reactor. This is very important because the slurry that comes out of the reactor is a nuisance."
29,2022-08-14,133, **Interviewer**: You have said it's safe. Can you elaborate on that please?," **Interviewee**: If you look at charcoal, it's easy to get burn after stepping or being exposed to hot coal. That can't happen with a biogas stove because its stove is smart. The gas itself is not volatile, so it's user friendly."
29,2022-08-14,134, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: I think there is a lot to be done especially on sensitization. Also, I feel like no improvements are being made on biogas digester. If you look at our digesters, they came with a first and second one, but both failed. And when you carefully analyze the digesters, you will see that they had many areas of improvements that needed to be looked at. So, I think a third digester should have come and take into account all the failures of the first and second, and see where we can get. In short, biogas is good but many people don't know it. I feel like we need to keep on improving the technology, because now we are not there."
29,2022-08-14,135, **Interviewer**: How can we sensitize people on biogas?," **Interviewee**: First, we need to build reliable digesters then distribute them in school, hospital, so that people should see then. And people have to be told how much money they are saving by using digesters... But now, many people are not using it, because it has lots of issues."
29,2022-08-14,136, **Interviewer**: What improvements would you want to see?," **Interviewee**: It has to work at least 4 hours so that we can use it in the morning, afternoon and evening. I think this could be done with storage bags. It has to be durable -- it shouldn't last only five months. Lastly, they have to make it in a way we can feed it once a week. The other thing is that the digester bag has to stay at least 20 meters away from the house."
29,2022-08-14,137," **Interviewer**: Last question. If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: In regards to energy intervention, I would choose an intervention that would not need money to use, just like biogas. With biogas you only use waste, so it\`s very good in that regard because it saves money."
29,2022-08-14,138," **Interviewer**: So, you need something like biogas."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, something like biogas. Or, even solar technology that can be used for cooking. But, I'm not sure about solar panels that can be used for cooking, because they can cost a lot of money and cannot be attainable."
29,2022-08-14,139, **Interviewer**: Any last word in regards biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is good. I thank this project because without this project, I would not have known it. But, now that I have used it, I would like to see more LPG gas spots available. I would like LPG gas to be accessible, so that many people can cook without cutting trees."
29,2022-08-14,140," **Interviewer**: Thanks, for the interview"," **Interviewee**: I should be there one thanking you, we have had a good chat."
30,2022-09-22,1,Where did the digester originate from?,"I don't know where it came from because the people who were coming at first were mostly linking with my father. I remember that time I was only told to dig the hole. So to answer your question, I don't really know who it was."
30,2022-09-22,2,"But, your father does know?",I believe so.
30,2022-09-22,3,When was it built?,"It's been long, I can't remember."
30,2022-09-22,4,I guess 2017...,"Yeah, it must be around that time."
30,2022-09-22,5,Who built it?,"We built it. We was just told dig a hole and we did. Then, they came with equipment and installed it. So, I can say we did the rest of the work."
30,2022-09-22,6,"How many people came to install it? And, where did they say they came from? I have come here and told you that I'm from Poly, Blantyre. Where did they say they came from?",I just remember that they came here for biogas. I don't remember about the name of the project or anything like that.
30,2022-09-22,7,"Okay, how long did it take you build?"," **Interviewee**: It was a lot of work that time because the ground was very compact. It took us one week, if not two weeks. They told us to dig a hole of 1 meter deep."
30,2022-09-22,8, **Interviewer**: For most people it took them a day or two to digging the hole... Why did it take you so long?," **Interviewee**: After they came the first time, they told us that the hole was not big enough. So, we had to dig again."
30,2022-09-22,9, **Interviewer**: You have said the hole was one meter deep. How big were the other sides?," **Interviewee**: I don't remember, but that was its depth. So, maybe its diameter was 1.5 meters or 2 meters."
30,2022-09-22,10, **Interviewer**: What was your role?," **Interviewee**: Our first role was to dig the hole for the digester bag. After that, they came with the equipment, for example, a stove, pipes and the digester bag, they told us how to make feedstock, and we made feedstock to start up the digester. It was not easy to make the feedstock. It was hard work. After feeding the digester bag, it got inflated. The bag inflated more especially when there was the sun."
30,2022-09-22,11, **Interviewer**: How many people came to install it?," **Interviewee**: They came 3 times; the first time three people came. The second time one person came. And, the last time they came in cars to start up all the digesters that were installed in this area."
30,2022-09-22,12," **Interviewer**: Okay, in this village, we have more than 300 households, how were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: It's because we are hard worker. I mean, it's not easy to manage it. It needs hardworking people, and most people out of the 300 couldn't have manage it."
30,2022-09-22,13, **Interviewer**: Are you not boasting about yourselves?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we are hard workers. When projects come, they go through the chiefs, so chiefs know which people are hard working and reliable in the village."
30,2022-09-22,14," **Interviewer**: So, you are sure that chiefs know which people are reliable and hardworking within the community?"," **Interviewee**: Chiefs know the behavior of every person in a community. They are more like teachers at school; they know the strength and weaknesses of every student. So, chiefs know people who don't take part in community development projects. They also know which people are active in the community, so when community development projects come active and hard working people are chosen."
30,2022-09-22,15, **Interviewer**: Which part are you active? Which area can you say sets you apart from the rest?," **Interviewee**: It's just that some people dodge community projects but we are always there, and the chief knows. That's why he always chooses us to take part in every project and it motivates us that they recognize us."
30,2022-09-22,16," **Interviewer**: Apart from the biogas project, which project were you involved in or are you involved?"," **Interviewee**: An NGO called DAPP came and they gave us goats. Another NGO too came, they gave us goats too, and it's the goats in those goat houses."
30,2022-09-22,17, **Interviewer**: What are the goat projects about?," **Interviewee**: For example, DAPP came to give us 5 goats, 4 female and one male. They said after conceiving we should give the goats to other people, so that at the end of the project many people should have goats to support their livelihood. But, the ones in that goat house were strictly given to us."
30,2022-09-22,18," **Interviewer**: You have said you have seen people shunning from projects, which you were part of, can you give me an example of that project?"," **Interviewee**: It's not that people always run away from community projects, but a few people usually dodge projects that do not benefit them directly. So once they see that the project benefits the community as a whole they work without commitment or they even manage to run away from the project."
30,2022-09-22,19," **Interviewer**: so I want to see one project, which some people shunned, but you didn't."," **Interviewee**: I remember one time there was a project concerning construction of pit latrines at our health center. The chiefs were asked to mobilize people to make bricks. Many people refused to take part in the project saying it was too much work and that the brick were made at a very far distance. But, my father, two-step brothers and I were going there the whole time to make bricks."
30,2022-09-22,20, **Interviewer**: Did you know biogas before?," **Interviewee**: As for me, I learned about it from the books. But, this was my first time."
30,2022-09-22,21," **Interviewer**: Which books? And, what did you learn about biogas?", **Interviewee**: I learned it from school that it's a cooking technology. We also learned about its props and cons. So we know its importance and drawbacks.... Yeah!
30,2022-09-22,22, **Interviewer**: What are its props and cons?," **Interviewee**: It has many props and cons. But, I can only say what I saw and not what I heard because I didn't really comprehend it from books. The first drawback is that when you feed it, for example, with 5 buckets of feedstock \[start up feedstock\], it takes time produce gas or it doesn't even produce gas at all. The other thing is that it's somewhat not safe for kids, for example, one time the digestate spilled over a little child."
30,2022-09-22,23, **Interviewer**: How is that possible?," **Interviewee**: When you feed the digester bag with feedstock the bad inflates. Sometimes the bag inflates excessively especially on sunny days and it releases digestate at the outlet. Sometimes, it comes out with force like an explosion. I remember one time it spilled over a child who was playing around it to the extent that we took the child to the hospital."
30,2022-09-22,24," **Interviewer**: Oh, did it really happen? Or, you are just trying to make up a story?"," **Interviewee**: No, it's happened."
30,2022-09-22,25, **Interviewer**: So you went to the hospital?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we did. So, after that we realized that it was not safe for kids to play around it."
30,2022-09-22,26, **Interviewer**: What was the kid doing there?," **Interviewee**: You know kids; he was just attracted to it after maybe seeing us also there. And, he took part in gathering the start up feed because we required a lot of it labor, and we had to ask from other people. So, everyone was involved and he wasn't a stranger to it."
30,2022-09-22,27," **Interviewer**: Okay, what are its props?"," **Interviewee**: It helped us in cooking, as we didn't need to source firewood and charcoal. And it was very useful in the morning because it was easy to ignite and cook on."
30,2022-09-22,28, **Interviewer**: What was the selection process?," **Interviewee**: As far as I'm concerned, it was about hard work. But, I don't know how the whole selection process went down. The chiefs know though."
30,2022-09-22,29, **Interviewer**: What was your role in the selection process? Did you participate in the selection process?," **Interviewee**: When the digesters came, we asked what the use of digesters was."
30,2022-09-22,30, **Interviewer**: Who did you ask?, **Interviewee**: We asked the chiefs because they were the ones that selected the beneficiaries.
30,2022-09-22,31,Where did you ask them?, **Interviewee**: At a community meeting.
30,2022-09-22,32," **Interviewer**: So the chiefs selected the beneficiaries at a community meeting, and you participated the meeting. But, you don't know how exactly they chose you, so you thing you were chosen because you are hard workers?"," **Interviewee**: Right. So we asked them what biogas is, and they said it's used for cooking."
30,2022-09-22,33, **Interviewer**: Then you accepted it to come here?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, because it was hard to find firewood. The other thing is that we were lacking money to buy charcoal. Charcoal is very expensive. Also, we accepted it because there are no extra costs once it's installed unlike electricity."
30,2022-09-22,34," **Interviewer**: Okay, what to were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: We expected to use it for a long time. Unfortunately, it stopped working on its own after a short time, so we just abandon it."
30,2022-09-22,35, **Interviewer**: Why did you think that you would use it for a long time?," **Interviewee**: It was because we were solely responsible for its gas producing. It was different from electricity, which depends on Escom. So we thought that after feeding it we would be getting gas all the time. And indeed, every time we fed the digester bag it was getting full because of gas. And, when there was no gas in the bag was deflating."
30,2022-09-22,36," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were you told to expect from the digester by the installers?"," **Interviewee**: We didn't know what biogas is, so when they came they explained what it is. They mentioned that it could be use for cooking instead of firewood. And, that's why we were excited about it, and that's why we committed ourselves to do the work to the point it was installed there."
30,2022-09-22,37, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive from the installers?, **Interviewee**: We just told us to take good care of it.
30,2022-09-22,38," **Interviewer**: What do you mean? I mean, they didn't just say this is the digester, please take good care of it. I mean, that can only take less than a minute, so I would like to know what did they tell you exactly?"," **Interviewee**: First, they showed us the parts of the digester and told us their names and functions. Secondly, they showed us gas valves, which need to be open to get gas. They said when we opened the valves we were going to hear a certain sound from the digester bag which signals presence of gas in the reactor. Then, they showed us where to press to get gas on the burners. After that, they asked us to do what we were told, and it worked. So that's how we knew its operation."
30,2022-09-22,39," **Interviewer**: Okay, nice. How prepared to run or operate did you feel were?"," **Interviewee**: After that, we felt very confident that we could run it. Besides that, the installers told us that they would be coming regularly to see if we were doing things correctly. And indeed, we were able to operate it. I remember one time they came after a week or so, and they found us cooking and they said that we were doing things accordingly."
30,2022-09-22,40, **Interviewer**: What were you cooking?, **Interviewee**: Vegetables.
30,2022-09-22,41, **Interviewer**: How many times did they come after installation?, **Interviewee**: I think it was once.
30,2022-09-22,42, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention? Was it just firewood?," **Interviewee**: We only use the firewood that we sourced from the mountains. In a month, we were probably going there 2 or 3 times. So every Saturday neighbors gather around and start to source firewood."
30,2022-09-22,43," **Interviewer**: So, it's a group of people that go there? You don't go as individuals?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, a group of women goes there on Saturdays."
30,2022-09-22,44, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: I don't know why
30,2022-09-22,45, **Interviewer**: Like these things started way back?, **Interviewee**: (laughs) yeah.
30,2022-09-22,46," **Interviewer**: Okay, what about charcoal?"," **Interviewee**: We use charcoal when things are going well for us. Thus, we use charcoal when we have money. But in most cases, we usually use firewood."
30,2022-09-22,47, **Interviewer**: Which period of the year do things go well for you? Is it after harvesting or it's just random?," **Interviewee**: It's not like there are certain periods of the year that we have plenty of money. So. We buy charcoal when the need for other necessities like school fees is not there. And, it's not like the firewood stays long, so they try as much as possible to gather enough wood. Right now, we don't have firewood, but we can't buy because there no money. So, we will wait until Saturday for them to get firewood."
30,2022-09-22,48, **Interviewer**: Who collects wood in this house?, **Interviewee**: My four little sisters.
30,2022-09-22,49, **Interviewer**: And everyone goes there 2 or 3 times a month to get bundles of wood?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's far so they get small bundles, and that's why we run out of wood sometimes."
30,2022-09-22,50, **Interviewer**: What happens when you run out of firewood while there's no money around as it is now?, **Interviewee**: We just look for small dry branches of trees around or use dry vegetation.
30,2022-09-22,51," **Interviewer**: You said sometimes you buy charcoal, how often do you buy charcoal and how much do you use?"," **Interviewee**: One bag of charcoal stays for 2 or 3 months because it's only supplementary. But, charcoal is expensive these days. I don't know if its price has gone up because price other things have gone up as well."
30,2022-09-22,52, **Interviewer**: How much is bag now?," **Interviewee**: It was K2500. Now, it's K3000. But, that's a small bag and not the standard 50 kg bag you know. But, like I said, we only buy charcoal when we are too desperate."
30,2022-09-22,53, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: There was nothing we were doing with it.
30,2022-09-22,54, **Interviewer**: You don't use it in your farms or even sell to others?, **Interviewee**: I have never heard or seen a person buying manure here. No.
30,2022-09-22,55, **Interviewer**: Why? People have a lot of cattle?," **Interviewee**: There is plenty of cattle here. It's too many! But, of course, other people do take manure to their farms to enrich the soil."
30,2022-09-22,56, **Interviewer**: You are saying other people meaning that you don't do that?," **Interviewee**: When it floods here, the riverbanks become fertile. And, this happens every year as rivers from the other part of Malawi carry fertile soil here. So, we don't apply manure. And, if we can do so, we would kill the maize due to excess nutrients."
30,2022-09-22,57," **Interviewer**: So, it's not like you grow you crops around this community. But you grow you crops near the river?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, no one plants within the village. We plant maize at the riverbanks."
30,2022-09-22,58," **Interviewer**: So, who are these ""others"" who take manure to their farms?"," **Interviewee**: Some people who have farms farther away from the riverbanks do use manure when the floods were not severe the previous year. But, it's very rare."
30,2022-09-22,59, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you start it up with?," **Interviewee**: The work we did on the first day was very intense. I think we used 10 to 20 buckets of cow manure, as the digester bag was a big one. To this, we added water to make suitable slurry, so a lot of water and manure went in there."
30,2022-09-22,60, **Interviewer**: How much water did you use?," **Interviewee**: It was a lot of water, but I can't know the exact amount because we were directly adding water to the manure from the source without counting. But, it was a lot of water because we did the work from morning to 4 or 5 PM."
30,2022-09-22,61, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: We got it from a borehole.
30,2022-09-22,62, **Interviewer**: Where is the borehole?, **Interviewee**: It's close to that school there.
30,2022-09-22,63, **Interviewer**: That's like 700 meter from here. Not close.," **Interviewee**: Yes, but we were lucky that time because the entire four boreholes that preceded that one were so far away. That one was only some months old that time."
30,2022-09-22,64," **Interviewer**: After feeding it, how long did it take to start up?"," **Interviewee**: It didn't take long to start up. I think it didn't take more than a week. It took 2 to 5 days, I think. And, the installers told us to wait for this time, so that they could come and commissioning it."
30,2022-09-22,65," **Interviewer**: Okay, so on the day of commissioning, the installers came?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they came."
30,2022-09-22,66, **Interviewer**: How many people came?, **Interviewee**: They came in a car; I think they were 3 or 4 people.
30,2022-09-22,67," **Interviewer**: ... And they were like let's start it. So, how did it work after commissioning?"," **Interviewee**: It worked, but it didn't stay long. Then, the installers were like wait for some hours it will work."
30,2022-09-22,68," **Interviewer**: So that time you saw fire on it, but it wasn't strong?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, when we started it up again, it worked, but it went off while we were cooking."
30,2022-09-22,69, **Interviewer**: What did you cook?, **Interviewee**: We were cooking beans when it went off.
30,2022-09-22,70, **Interviewer**: So the problems started on the first day?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
30,2022-09-22,71," **Interviewer**: So, from the first day you couldn't use it in the morning, at lunch and at night?", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
30,2022-09-22,72, **Interviewer**: How much cooking time were you getting in a day?," **Interviewee**: In the first days, we were not getting more than one hour, and the fire itself wasn't strong."
30,2022-09-22,73, **Interviewer**: How was the fire like in that one hour?," **Interviewee**: It was like when we put the digester on volume 8, after a short time the fire was like it was on volume 3, then it would go off -- The fire was going off gradually. It wasn't lasting 20 minutes."
30,2022-09-22,74, **Interviewer**: How did you use the gas?, **Interviewee**: It was only for cooking
30,2022-09-22,75,How many people used the gas?," **Interviewee**: 12 people. My father has 2 wives, so we are many."
30,2022-09-22,76, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?,"We were required to feed it with cow manure; without cow manure, it couldn't work. Also, we were supposed to feed it repeatedly with 2 or 3 buckets cow manure."
30,2022-09-22,77, **Interviewer**: How often did you feed it?," **Interviewee**: We were feeding it 2 or 3 times a week, sometimes once a week, and with that we could use it the whole week."
30,2022-09-22,78," **Interviewer**: Okay, in a week you were feeding it twice or thrice, and sometimes even once. So in one feed, how much manure did you use?", **Interviewee**: Maybe 2 buckets.
30,2022-09-22,79, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add?," **Interviewee**: We used to add 2 buckets of water as well. After that, we used to mix the feedstock."
30,2022-09-22,80, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare it?," **Interviewee**: We used to wear a plastic bag to separate somewhat dry manure from fresh manure, and put the manure in a bucket. Then, we would add water and mix it with hands whilst putting on a plastic bag."
30,2022-09-22,81, **Interviewer**: So you were wearing plastic bags as protective gloves?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
30,2022-09-22,82," **Interviewer**: Who told you to do that? Or, you just thought it wise to use plastic bags?", **Interviewee**: We had no gloves so they told us to use the plastic bags instead of gloves to stay hygienic.
30,2022-09-22,83," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you soak the manure in a bucket and use it the next day to prepare your feedstock, or you mixed your manure on the spot?"," **Interviewee**: We were not soaking it. But, sometimes we ran out of manure, so we would go ask for 3 buckets from others before the night. Then, we would keep the manure in buckets until the next day. So the next day we would go collect water, add to the manure, and then feed the digester."
30,2022-09-22,84, **Interviewer**: How did people respond when you went to ask you for manure?," **Interviewee**: It was okay because people knew we had a digester, so they weren't tough on us. Also, we got it easily because we are farmers, and farmers generally share such things."
30,2022-09-22,85, **Interviewer**: How far was it from here to where you were getting manure?," **Interviewee**: It was some distance because that time it was only us living on this upper side of the village. Back then, people were staying on the lower side of the village. So, it's can be easy to feed it this time."
30,2022-09-22,86, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: We used to share the task. My father, brother and I used to collect manure and prepare the feedstock. My little sisters were responsible for collecting water."
30,2022-09-22,87," **Interviewer**: How would you describe the task of feeding it? To some, it's nothing but to some it's hard work that they even deny a biogas digester. What's your take?"," **Interviewee**: It was simple for us because we shared the tasks, and it involved a lot of people too."
30,2022-09-22,88," **Interviewer**: How did you manage the feedstock, for example, how did you take out the trash?"," **Interviewee**: When you get cow manure from the cow house, you don\'t really see the trash. But when you start mixing it that's when you see the trash. So, we used to remove it, so that we could have it without trash."
30,2022-09-22,89, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: Just to have good feedstock.
30,2022-09-22,90, **Interviewer**: Were you told to do so?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
30,2022-09-22,91, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?, **Interviewee**: It was about taking good care of it.
30,2022-09-22,92, **Interviewer**: What do you mean?," **Interviewee**: It needed to be fed to work, and the manure was supposed to be trash free."
30,2022-09-22,93," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were you supposed to do when it malfunctioned?"," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I remember that when it malfunctioned the installers told us to keep the equipment safe, so they should find the equipment intact."
30,2022-09-22,94," **Interviewer**: During the time it worked, did it meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: No, and we only used it for a very short time. Even now we feel bad about the whole thing and we wonder if we are going to use it again someday... We didn't get impressed or satisfied!"
30,2022-09-22,95, **Interviewer**: How long did you use it?," **Interviewee**: It did not work for more than a year. We dissembled it after it stopped working as they told us to dissemble it whenever the problem of a nature that we could not fix. So, we have things like the pipes and stove are in the house."
30,2022-09-22,96," **Interviewer**: Specifically, how long did it work before it stopped working? I mean, how long did it take from the moment it was commissioned to the point where you stopped using it?", **Interviewee**: It's two weeks from the day we started using it. It didn't take long.
30,2022-09-22,97," **Interviewer**: So after 2 weeks, you stopped feeding it?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, after 2 weeks when we tried to feed it, nothing was happening, so we just abandoned it."
30,2022-09-22,98, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?, **Interviewee**: The only challenge was that it was not producing adequate fire.
30,2022-09-22,99," **Interviewer**: So, in those 2 week's you were still using firewood?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it wasn't working, so we kept doing what we do best, cooking on firewood."
30,2022-09-22,100," **Interviewer**: (Laughs) okay, so after 2 weeks, you stopped everything?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah. We were very disappointed. So, we returned to firewood up to now."
30,2022-09-22,101, **Interviewer**: Did you try to fix it after those 2 weeks?," **Interviewee**: We were only feeding it, then trying to see if it would produce gas. Of course, when we fed it the digester bag was inflating, but it couldn't produce fire. Then, we thought if we kept feeding it, we would make the problem worse."
30,2022-09-22,102, **Interviewer**: How many times did you feed it?," **Interviewee**: It was three times. And, every time we fed it, digestate was coming out, but no flame was coming out. Then, we thought that maybe the feedstock was not enough, so we fed it 2 more times. But, nothing happened so we stopped feeding it."
30,2022-09-22,103, **Interviewer**: Did you try to call the project implementers?," **Interviewee**: I do not know if they were called, but I know that the chief was told. So they told us to keep the equipment safe because the things weren't technically ours."
30,2022-09-22,104, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this \[sheet of intervention\]? What do you think of this Information? And do you think it could have helped in your case?, **Interviewee**: It could have I helped a lot and I'm sure today you could have found it working.
30,2022-09-22,105, **Interviewer**: How?," **Interviewee**: We would have been going through the information and act accordingly. In our case, we had a problem but didn't exactly know what the problem was, so we couldn't do anything."
30,2022-09-22,106," **Interviewer**: someone would say to fix something you don\'t just need information but you also need equipment. For example, you may know that a car engine is broken, but to fix it you need to get spare parts or a new engine. Do you think you could have managed to get the things you saw on the digester if they had issues?"," **Interviewee**: The digester was a simple thing as it had limited number of accessories, so I think its equipment would have been easy to find. Thus, we only needed information to keep it running; we just wanted to know what to do when there was a problem; we did not need spanners and all that."
30,2022-09-22,107," **Interviewer**: Okay, how would you describe the current state of your digester today?"," **Interviewee**: It's dead because it's not working. It's like a seriously broken car, when you have one, you don't say I have a car. As it stands, we don't have a digester. We only have firewood as a source of energy for cooking now."
30,2022-09-22,108," **Interviewer**: But, you still have some of the equipment?"," **Interviewee**: We have all the equipment, but we don't have biogas; we have pipes, the stove and the bag."
30,2022-09-22,109, **Interviewer**: Do you think with the equipment you have it can work again?," **Interviewee**: I believe it can be revamped, but things have to change. I feel if the digester is revamped and then things happen as the last time, I see it eventually failing again. So, if they could do things differently, then things would work better than last time."
30,2022-09-22,110," **Interviewer**: What needs to happen differently? Or, what need to change?", **Interviewee**: The implementers need to analyze what went wrong and then make proper changes in terms of its design; they need to use things that can work and last long.
30,2022-09-22,111, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: The thing lasted barely two weeks, so maybe the things were not original."
30,2022-09-22,112," **Interviewer**: How did it reach this state, and in your opinion what caused it to fail?"," **Interviewee**: I can't say it failed because we did something wrong. If you saw how hard we worked, you can even agree that we did put in effort. Even our neighbors can bear witness to that. Maybe it failed because it just wasn\`t meant to be. But, on our part, we did everything as instructed by the implementers."
30,2022-09-22,113," **Interviewer**: You saw everything, so there must be something that caused it to fail. In your opinion, what is it?"," **Interviewee**: I have no idea. They told us to feed it and we did feed it as instructed, so I don't know how and why it failed. Even now, I still try to figure why it failed, but I don't find the answer. Maybe if the installer could come and analyze what went wrong, then we would know. And if they could come today and say this is what went wrong, let's work together and make it work, I would work with them as the first time."
30,2022-09-22,114, **Interviewer**: Don't you think the fact that they didn't come again is a sign of failure on their part?," **Interviewee**: In my view, I thought the project phased out. I think the project ended after installation of the digesters. But, I don't feel the installers are failures. I'm saying this because I feel like when they brought this they knew how this thing works."
30,2022-09-22,115," **Interviewer**: But, it never worked to say they did a good job?"," **Interviewee**: It never worked it. We feel saddened that we lost a lot of energy. Imagine digging that big hole; imagine feeding that big bag with manure. We dug the hole, but they kept on saying we should keep on digging because it wasn't enough until they said it was enough. It hurts me that we did a hard job only to use it for a short time!"
30,2022-09-22,116," **Interviewer**: (laughs) that's not on! Now that it's not working, how do you manage your feedstock?"," **Interviewee**: Some we take to the farm, some we burn on that spot where there ash \[points to stack of ash\] and make sure that the smoke goes to the animal house to kill ticks and parasites on the animals."
30,2022-09-22,117, **Interviewer**: Does it work?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, 100%. The ticks can just stand the smoke."
30,2022-09-22,118," **Interviewer**: Okay, we are moving towards the end of the interview. How much did it cost?", **Interviewee**: On our part or their part?
30,2022-09-22,119, **Interviewer**: Both.," **Interviewee**: Maybe them, but for us we didn't use any money. Everything was paid for us."
30,2022-09-22,120, **Interviewer**: Who paid for you?, **Interviewee**: I think it is an NGO that paid for us.
30,2022-09-22,121, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: Because I have seen you. But, that time I didn\`t know it was the government or an NGO."
30,2022-09-22,122, **Interviewer**: What do you mean?," **Interviewee**: If it were government, then you would have come with other government workers from this area."
30,2022-09-22,123, **Interviewer**: (laughs) did you contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: No.
30,2022-09-22,124, **Interviewer**: You didn't use bricks to line it with a brick wall or something?," **Interviewee**: We lined the edge of the hole with a brick wall, so to protect it and make it noticeable to people. We lined it also to keep it in shape and straight, because it going out of shape when it was full."
30,2022-09-22,125, **Interviewer**: How many bricks did you use?, **Interviewee**: We lined it with a 2-layer wall. We only used 40 bricks.
30,2022-09-22,126, **Interviewer**: Who lined it?," **Interviewee**: My father is a builder, so he did the work."
30,2022-09-22,127, **Interviewer**: Did you buy the bricks?," **Interviewee**: No, someone gave us for free."
30,2022-09-22,128, **Interviewer**: How much cement did you use?, **Interviewee**: We didn't use cement; we used mud.
30,2022-09-22,129," **Interviewer**: Okay, what special items had to be imported from another country?"," **Interviewee**: No, everything can be found here."
30,2022-09-22,130, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: (laugh) maybe it's not from Malawi, because when you look at the equipment it looks durable and expensive. Also, if it was from Malawi, the installers would have come to fix it or change the equipment when it didn't work."
30,2022-09-22,131," **Interviewer**: Okay, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Biogas is good when it's working. But, when you look at how it worked here, you have to say it's not good.... The way things panned out here, it makes it seem awful because we didn't use it long. Also, like I said, I became aware of biogas at school, so I expected to learn more from this, but I learned nothing from this. I expected to learn more about it, but I was disappointed to learn nothing."
30,2022-09-22,132, **Interviewer**: Which school did you learn about biogas?, **Interviewee**: I learn it when I was in grade 7 and in secondary.
30,2022-09-22,133, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: Maybe in other areas people are using biogas, but here it's a failure. I don't know why it failed here though. It will start getting bright if people would start using it for longer periods. Here you can't say there was or there is biogas, we tried it and failed. When we got it, people wished it was them as they expected to use it as a replacement for firewood. But, now I don't think people would have the desire to own one just because they didn't see anything good when we got it."
30,2022-09-22,134," **Interviewer**: Last one. If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?", **Interviewee**: I can only think of electricity.
30,2022-09-22,135, **Interviewer**: Why electricity?, **Interviewee**: It has fewer problems and its problems can be solved. Biogas was just a waste of time; we wasted time in digging holes and we got nothing from it. I'm sure if it was electricity we would have been using it today.
30,2022-09-22,136, **Interviewer**: Electricity needs money. To use it for cooking you will need an electric stove. Can you manage it?," **Interviewee**: Yes, we can manage."
30,2022-09-22,137," **Interviewer**: In closing, do you have anything to say?"," **Interviewee**: If it's coming back, then the installers need to change the technology. Or, if it's the same, then they need to train us on its maintenance, so that we can do some of the things on our own. This one here failed because we didn't have the expertise. So, when it malfunctioned we were clueless and helpless."
30,2022-09-22,138, **Interviewer**: Okay. thanks for the interview.,NA
31,2022-09-22,1,Where did this digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: The project came through Tengani EPA \[Extension Planning Area\]. The basis of the project was to conduct a pilot project of 5 or 6 biogas digesters. I think the total number of digesters was 10, but the remaining digesters went to another village within Tengani T/A (Tradition Authority) though. When the people from the EPA came, they said a certain organization was giving us biogas digesters with an objective of reducing deforestation by tackling the use of firewood and charcoal for cooking. So, I think the people from Tengani EPA know exactly which organization it was."
31,2022-09-22,2,"When you say EPA, you mean the agriculture office as in Extension Planning Area?",Yeah
31,2022-09-22,3,"So they didn't tell you which organization it was? Or, did you only engage with people from Tengani EPA?","I am not sure. The people were just the saying biogas, biogas."
31,2022-09-22,4,Who built it?,The names are on this paper \[hands over a handover document\]
31,2022-09-22,5,"Oh, it is \[name redacted\]. How many people did he come with?"," **Interviewee**: He came with 2 other people. So they were 3 in total. One was a respectable man in his late 40s, while the other 2 were simple young men."
31,2022-09-22,6," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you help in the building process?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, I was responsible for digging the hole and preparing feedstock, which was used to feed the digester. As for assembling the digester, they did the work and we were only observing."
31,2022-09-22,7, **Interviewer**: How many were you on your side?," **Interviewee**: It was my family and I basically, plus some neighbors, who came to see the installation of the digester."
31,2022-09-22,8, **Interviewer**: Like how many people?, **Interviewee**: 8 people of which 4 people were neighbors.
31,2022-09-22,9," **Interviewer**: So, 8 of you were involved in digging, collecting water and making feedstock?"," **Interviewee**: I did the digging alone. I also sourced manure alone. However, my family and neighbors assisted me in collecting water. Also, I hired people to help me transport the manure because it was a lot, and I was getting it from a far distant. I think it was 6 bags (50 kg) of cow manure. But, some I got from my cow house, because we used 12 bags to start it up."
31,2022-09-22,10, **Interviewer**: Where did you get it?," **Interviewee**: At Chambutulo, the place I said you should call me when you were passing by."
31,2022-09-22,11," **Interviewer**: Oh, some 2 km from here.", **Interviewee**: Yeah
31,2022-09-22,12, **Interviewer**: When was it built?, **Interviewee**: I think the date is on the paper as well. Everything is there.
31,2022-09-22,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, let me see. Yeah, it was built on 11 July 2017. How long did it take to build it?"," **Interviewee**: They gave me pressure to do things in haste. I was told to do the work in 4 days. It took me a day to dig the hole, 2 days to gather feedstock, and another day for preparing and assembling the digester. After that, I was told to wait for 7 days to commission it."
31,2022-09-22,14," **Interviewer**: You have told me you were getting manure at Chambutulo, where were you getting water?", **Interviewee**: I was getting water from a borehole behind those trees. I think it is half a kilometer from here.
31,2022-09-22,15, **Interviewer**: Okay. You have also said you used some of your cow manure. How many cows did you have?," **Interviewee**: I had 5 cows\... And, I was told to feed it daily with 20 Kgs of fresh cow manure. So that time it was simple for us because our cows were producing more manure than required."
31,2022-09-22,16," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you buy the 6 bags of manure from Chambutulo?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, I brought."
31,2022-09-22,17, **Interviewer**: Like how much?," **Interviewee**: I did not buy it from one person. So, one person charged me K500 per bag and I got 2 bags from him. The other person charged me K300 per bag and I got 4 bags from him. I bought it from Chambutulo village because there was high demand for cow manure here that time. Everyone was sourcing cow manure to start up his or her digester, so it was a lot of fresh manure that was needed within that shot time. So, when we did gathered manure, they commended us for getting enough and quality manure. They even said that with that manure, it was going to start up easily."
31,2022-09-22,18," **Interviewer**: Wow\... Mmh, I can see that there are many people in this village, even more than a hundred. So, how were you selected as a beneficiary out of such a huge number of people?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, I cannot speak for them why they chose me, but personally I think it is because of my hard work, commitment and proactiveness -- I known for being prompt in doing things."
31,2022-09-22,19, **Interviewer**: What do you mean when you say you are prompt and proactive? Can you elaborate on that?," **Interviewee**: As a lead farmer, when I'm told to do something by extension workers, I need minimal supervision, and I do finish work within the specified time. For example, when I'm told to make special type of ridges by extension workers, I do it on my own and on time. I do not wait for them. I take responsibility so they know I can do things by myself without being forced."
31,2022-09-22,20, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I knew nothing about biogas."
31,2022-09-22,21, **Interviewer**: So you knew about biogas when they came with the project?," **Interviewee**: Yes, before that I did not know anything about biogas. I only knew of firewood (laughs). And, I was getting firewood from those mountains."
31,2022-09-22,22," **Interviewer**: It is far! Some 2 kilometers, I guess.", **Interviewee**: It's 3 or 3.5 kilometers.
31,2022-09-22,23, **Interviewer**: So biogas was a new thing to you.... And you were like what's this?," **Interviewee**: and the way they explained it, we thought we would never use firewood again (laughs). They said that if they install it and work, some people would even be interested to buy it at K200000. So after hearing that we thought that we were blessed and we did everything to make it work, and make others want it. But, instead of them wanting it, we became laughing stocks and a byword for biogas failures. They said we are gullible, and easily enticed by petty things and that we wasted our energy for nothing."
31,2022-09-22,24, **Interviewer**: (laughs) that's interesting. How did you feel?," **Interviewee**: In villages, people talk a lot. Some talked out of jealousy and some it is just there nature. So I didn't feel that bad, but it felt like it was true. We worked for nothing."
31,2022-09-22,25, **Interviewer**: (laughs) you don't know how you were selected... You don't know the process?," **Interviewee**: On that, I don't know what criteria they used to choose me as a beneficiary."
31,2022-09-22,26, **Interviewer**: So they just came to you saying we are coming to give you a digester?," **Interviewee**: No, when the project implementers came with the project they had a meeting with the TA and the senior chiefs. So, it was the chiefs from different villages who chose who was going to benefit. From each village one person was chosen. But, I don't know which criteria the chiefs used. Personally, I think they chose me because I am a hard worker and proactive. But, the chiefs know which criteria they used. To cut the long story short, the extensions workers liaised with the senior chiefs. The senior chief asked their subordinate chiefs to choose one person from their villages. So 5 villages were chosen, and one person was taken from each village. But, they were told that the person had to have cows, was committed and willing to use the digester. And most of all, the person was not supposed to be money-oriented. The beneficiary was to accept the digester without expecting to be paid for using it. Also, the digesters were supposed to be given to the people and not to the chiefs to themselves. If a chief was to benefit, had to be only one, because it was for the people; they wanted to see how people were going to manage it."
31,2022-09-22,27, **Interviewer**: Clear! Why do think chiefs were not favored to benefit from this?," **Interviewee**: Only one chief benefited. I think the other chiefs maybe thought it was hard work to manage it. Or, they wanted to see how people were going to manage it, and then adopt it later. Also, if it had gone to a couple of chief, then we would have thought that chiefs are greedy. And, we could have thought biogas is for the chiefs -- that's what I would have thought personally. So, luckily, only one chief got it, Chief Sewe."
31,2022-09-22,28," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: As a family, we expected to stop damaging the environment because they clearly said that we would not find time to go and cut firewood for cooking. So, our time was only to be spent on making feedstock for cooking. They said that we will be cooking everything on it; nsima, beans, meat, vegetables etc. They said it was fast, and it is more like cooking on an electric cooker. Therefore, I personally thought I was blessed to have it and that one of my problems was solved."
31,2022-09-22,29," **Interviewer**: So you expected to save the environment, and to cook fast as well as modernly. What else were you told to expect from this?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, nothing. It's was just about cooking in time as it's produces fire upon ignition and you don't need to wait for the fire to pick up. So, it's fast. Also, we expected to cook modernly without spending money, opposed to cooking on electricity. So, it was all good."
31,2022-09-22,30, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: There was no training. The simply taught us how to dig the hole, and how to make feedstock. That was all. (Take of shirt)"
31,2022-09-22,31," **Interviewer**: It is very hot. Let me take of mine as well. It's hot. So, they only told you how to make feedstock?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that was it. They told to us get manure, and we got manure; pour that in that bucket, we poured the manure in the bucket; add water, and we added water; mix it, and we mixed water and manure; then they told us to make a funnel, we made a funnel for pouring feedstock into the digester through one of the pipes. That was it! Can I draw how it looked?"
31,2022-09-22,32," **Interviewer**: Yeah, go on!"," **Interviewee**: This was the bag, and to it, two pipes were connected. Flat rubber strips connected the pipes to it, and this is the pipe feedstock was poured. After feeding, the bag was expanding to this level (1 or 1.5 meter off ground) and it was releasing slurry. Once we saw the slurry we were not feeding it, we knew there was enough gas, and we feared that the bag would burst. After feeding it, it was taking 3 days to release the slurry at the outlet."
31,2022-09-22,33, **Interviewer**: How did you make the outlet?," **Interviewee**: It was like this (keeps on drawing)... so they told us that the slurry can be used as fertilizer.... Oh, you have asked me a good question, I forgot that part.... So, this was the level ground, so they told us to dig a hole to be gathering the digestate and use it as fertilizer."
31,2022-09-22,34," **Interviewer**: Oh nice, did you ever use the digestate as fertilizer?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) that's a great one! What they did everyone was satisfied with, and everyone was keen to see it perform. Sadly, we did not get enough gas, so less feedstock was fed. Our focus was on making it to produce fire, which was very beneficial; we cared less about the digestate; our primary concern was gas and not the digestate. So, after failing to get fire, do you think one would mind about the ""stupid"" things."
31,2022-09-22,35,"Ah, no."," **Interviewee**: So we did not want to waste energy on that. Our energy was on the gas. So when we saw that the digester was not working, we thought that what they said about the digestate was also not true; we thought like ""they want to kill our crops with digestate"".... When we saw that the digester was only producing fire for a minute or 20 seconds, we thought the same predicament might happen to our crops, if we used it as fertilizer. We thought it could not work on the crops, or even damage crops completely. But, all these ideas came because the digester failed to work. Then, that is when we started calling them, but they were just saying, ""Wait, we will come"". Therefore, we never used the digestate because of how the digester performed. If it had performed, we would have tried it on our crops, and proceeded accordingly."
31,2022-09-22,36," **Interviewer**: Okay, that is clear. The training was on feedstock preparation, and maybe on how to switch it on and off."," **Interviewee**: No, there was training. If you hire someone to do some electric wiring on your house with electricity, and then at the end he tells you switch on the bulb, can you say you have been trained?"
31,2022-09-22,37," **Interviewer**: Aah, no!"," **Interviewee**: That is how it was. They told us to dig a hole. After that they were like""do you see how we are connecting the pipes?"" And we were like ""yeah!"" Then, they were like ""Don't forget, keep it in your head"".... Then, we went to the stove and were like ""do you see this control knob, turn it"". We did that and they were like ""that's how you switch it on"". Then after a very short time they asked us to switch it off and went on to ask what we were going to be doing with the fire. And, we told them expected to be cooking nsima and dish side of different items. Then they were like, the fire today is not strong enough, but tomorrow it will be strong enough to cook all that. So, after they sent, fire also went with them. It never produced fire after."
31,2022-09-22,38," **Interviewer**: Of course, we have agreed that was not training. Still, I want to know that after that talk or so called training, how prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were?"," **Interviewee**: After all that we did not expect to go for training because they convinced us that we had learnt enough and that we had known everything that is necessary. So after that, we felt we didn't need any training, and we expected that we would be cooking without issues... But, the moment they left this place, it was also the death of the digester. Now, it's been for 4 years. We did not even use it for a year. So, we thought because it was installed in the rainy season that's why it never worked. But, when summer came, nothing happened."
31,2022-09-22,39, **Interviewer**: Why did you think that in summer it was going to work?," **Interviewee**: They said it works well when there is sunlight as gas production is high. They told us in summer we would be cooking the whole day for continuous days. So, we knew that in summer no matter what, it was going to work because it gets really hot here."
31,2022-09-22,40, **Interviewer**: You had the right to say that you did not want to digester.," **Interviewee**: Of course, I had the right to say no."
31,2022-09-22,41, **Interviewer**: Why did you accept it here?," **Interviewee**: They painted it as we would only struggle to get the first feedstock, but after that, we would be cooking without any problem. So when we heard that we thought it was worthy to accept it and look for the first manure, and then enjoy for the rest of our lives. They didn't give us a time limit, they only said that it could only stop working if someone could come with a spear and pierce it... Thus, I was like feeding it is not a problem, and I also dig pit latrines, so digging a digester hole shouldn't be a problem. Then, I went for it!"
31,2022-09-22,42, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: I used firewood.
31,2022-09-22,43, **Interviewer**: Okay... and you get it from the far mountains?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
31,2022-09-22,44, **Interviewer**: Do you buy?," **Interviewee**: No, we just send children to go there."
31,2022-09-22,45, **Interviewer**: Don't you get arrested by forest officials there?," **Interviewee**: If you are not so lucky, yeah. But, they only arrest people who cut trees to make charcoal or timber."
31,2022-09-22,46, **Interviewer**: Not for small dead wood and all," **Interviewee**: Yeah, if you go there and get dead wood, you do not get in trouble."
31,2022-09-22,47," **Interviewer**: How did you differentiate cooking on biogas ... Oh, you never used it, right!"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) that is a difficult one to answer. You cannot think of cooking when we did not even boil water to make tea. So in truth, we do not know anything about cooking on biogas."
31,2022-09-22,48, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: We used to throw away some. Some we used as fertilizer in our farms.
31,2022-09-22,49, **Interviewer**: Some you were just throwing away?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
31,2022-09-22,50, **Interviewer**: Meaning you were getting more than enough?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
31,2022-09-22,51, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you sell?, **Interviewee**: We do not normally sell. We only sell when we see that someone has a special purpose with it. (Stops and answers call)
31,2022-09-22,52," **Interviewer**: Okay, moving on. On the day of commissioning, who was there on that day?", **Interviewee**: The same 3 people came.
31,2022-09-22,53," **Interviewer**: Okay, after commissioning it, how did it work? Did you see fire?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, I saw fire. Then, they said that the next we would cook without issues, or we could even cook the same but a bit later. But, they suggested starting it the next day because the sun had gone down. It was somewhere after 3 pm. And, all the digesters here were installed here around the same time. Before going, they gave a time to start it the next day. They said 10 am. They assured us at 10 AM everything was going to go smoothly, and not to worry. And, yes indeed the bag at 10:00 got full. But, when we tried to switch it on, it couldn't produce fire. So we thought we had overdosed it, or it was because of something else we didn't know. Then we decided to try it again at 3:00 p.m. but nothing happened. So we never used it for cooking. We never cooked in nsima on it. The fire that was coming more was very little that you could only cook maybe an omelette (laughs) and it would take you more than 15 minutes to cook an omelette, imagine. It was shameful. We tried to check the volume control knob. It was okay because they showed up how it's works. It had 8 points, 3 was moderate, and 8 was the highest fire we could have got. Therefore, everything they told us was ""useless""."
31,2022-09-22,54, **Interviewer**: So how was the fire going off after that? Was it at once or it was taking some time?," **Interviewee**: Not in an instant. When we started it, it was producing little fire."
31,2022-09-22,55, **Interviewer**: Like how long?, **Interviewee**: It was taking about 10 or 15 seconds to go off.
31,2022-09-22,56, **Interviewer**: After that?," **Interviewee**: After that when we tried it, it was producing a low finger snapping sound like. We tried it again in the evening, nothing happened. And they came after some days to make us sign this paper. Then they told us that we just had no luck with it, and that was the last thing they said. And we were like we have used a lot of energy and money, we still want it to work, can you do something, we don't want to lose and it's not only us who will lose. The government would also lose. They have spent K200000, and you can't just let it go like that. And, they didn't say anything."
31,2022-09-22,57," **Interviewer**: (laughs) when you were starting it up you said you used 12 bags of 50kg of cow manure. Maybe, there was something wrong with the initial feedstock. How much water did you add to the cow manure?"," **Interviewee**: We cannot say the feedstock was not made right because we did everything according to their instructions and they were there. So technically, the installers made the feedstock even though we were the ones doing the whole thing. Moreover, they even said that it was good."
31,2022-09-22,58," **Interviewer**: (laughs) yeah, how much water did you add?", **Interviewee**: I do not know how many liters we used.
31,2022-09-22,59, **Interviewer**: Like how many buckets or drums?, **Interviewee**: I think it was 2 drums.
31,2022-09-22,60, **Interviewer**: The 200 liters ones I guess.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, because we used a lot of water and it was a lot of work. But, because we wanted it so bad, that's why we did everything possible. We wanted changed."
31,2022-09-22,61," **Interviewer**: Yeah, I see. What were the operation requirements?"," **Interviewee**: They said it needs to fresh manure and water, and that it requires to be fed on a daily basis. They told us to feed it with one bucket (20 liters) of manure and two buckets (20 liters) of water."
31,2022-09-22,62, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: It is within. We have a borehole just there \[less than 200 meters\].
31,2022-09-22,63, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We used hands to mix the feedstock, and we did that because we really wanted it. After mixing, we had a funnel which we made by cutting a 5 liter plastic bottle and it was for feeding the digester bag. We made it because we did not want some of the feedstock to spill away."
31,2022-09-22,64," **Interviewer**: After feeding it with startup feedstock, did you ever feed it again?"," **Interviewee**: They told us to feed it after 2 days from the day it was commissioned. But, after we saw that, it did not work for those 2 days we didn't feed. We did not feed it because we were told that gas is lost when one is cooking, so one feed it to replenish the used gas. So since we didn't use it, there was no need to replenish it... so to answer your question, we couldn't feed it, when it was not producing gas or fire."
31,2022-09-22,65, **Interviewer**: So you only fed it once?," **Interviewee**: No, we feed it thrice. The first time was when we were starting it. Then after that, we fed it when we saw that it wasn't producing gas. Then, again after we saw that it did not work, we fed it again. And, when the installers came, they said what we did was fine, and that the digester didn't work because it was just that we were unlucky."
31,2022-09-22,66, **Interviewer**: (laughs) what did they mean?," **Interviewee**: We were so mad with them and we even told them that they took the people of Nsanje for fools. We questioned them how was it possible for the 10 of us to fail; if 2 or 3 people had their digesters working that could have been a different story. But, imagine all the 10 people failed. And, we told them that not all the 10 people could be dull to make it work. Then, they were just saying it was not an issue such things happen in life, and that we were just not lucky."
31,2022-09-22,67," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: They gave us numbers to call whenever there was a problem. So when it did not work we called them, and they said would come in a space of 2 months. After some time they came."
31,2022-09-22,68," **Interviewer**: Oh, they came?"," **Interviewee**: They came with the handover papers. So we thought that they came to fix it but that was not the case. They just came so that we could sign the papers... But, you can't say we are to blame that it didn\'t work. If it had worked for a certain time, and then stopped working that would have been a different story. But it didn't work even though we did everything they told us. In fact, no one out of the 10 people used it. So we cannot say the digesters malfunctioned. It is simple and straightforward that the digesters did not work, and they issue of maintenance is way out of question - They gave us a dead thing. If it were a car, we would have said they gave us a car without an engine. And, I think what they were telling us about a biogas was wrong I mean, we did everything together but I never worked. So, maybe they were also learning about it, I don't know. Or, maybe they installers saw this thing somewhere else and decided to try it here to steal from us."
31,2022-09-22,69," **Interviewer**: You didn't put your, money so how did they steal from you?"," **Interviewee**: We paid money, the government paid money for us. The government could have given us money directly but it does not work that way. So, they paid the money for us indirectly. And they even said that they were only contractors meaning someone to give them the money to do the work here, and they told us the money that was spent on the digester. So, we take it as somebody gave us money and the installers stole the money from us. And, that thief has no remorse and is not considerate all. He did not even think of us. I mean, he should have at least allowed us to use it for some days... Imagine, the government gave us money and someone stole the money....... Not all of us were failures.... of course, we could not have all succeeded, but at least one person should have managed to make it work."
31,2022-09-22,70, **Interviewer**: So you are saying the installers are thieves?," **Interviewee**: They are big thieves...And I always wonder, because you are the fourth person to come ask me about this, when you talk to them do they say these things are working? And, if they tell you that it's working, it's very unfortunate. If they say it's working, why haven't they gone on radio to say people in Tengani are using biogas. Why don't they come and make us speak on radio to talk about the good thing the government has done for us? We hear people on radio people speaking about good things about certain projects, like agricultural scheme projects, we hear people talking about benefiting from goats that are given to community members to pass on amongst themselves, so that everyone has a goat. We hear people thanking the government and organizations on many things. But, why are we not thanking the government for the K200000 they gave us. Why is the government not following up on this? Why is the government not claiming back the money? So, we feel like the government and the contract are one. This was a scheme to siphon money. That is why I'm saying we were robbed money. And you as a messenger, you should go and inform the government that the people of Tengani who benefited from biogas project are saying \` you rob them money\` - \`The government robbed them money\`."
31,2022-09-22,71, **Interviewer**: (laughs heavily) really!," **Interviewee**: Yeah, the government and the contractor worked hand in hand to steal from us -- The government and contractor stole money from us and we are very saddened it! The fact that biogas digesters came here in 2017 it's just news. Who would know that there was a biogas digester here? No one. We were robbed money! I would have been very happy to share the stories of how it works in different season, its benefits and challenges, but I cannot because I never used it!"
31,2022-09-22,72," **Interviewer**: After you tried it, a day after commissioning, how long did it take you to call them?"," **Interviewee**: If it's a group thing, when you have a problem you don\'t go directly to the big guys. So, when I saw that it wasn't working, I decided to ask you my colleagues, and they were like, oh, we also have the same problem. Then I was like I did this and that, and my colleagues were like we also did the same thing. So, whatever I did everybody who got a digester did the same. Then we asked questions, like why and what the problem was! I mean, if one had managed to make it work, we would have said the rest had a problem, but no single person managed to make it work. Then, we were like those people trick us then let us make a call. Then, they came after a week; moved around it, touched it and played around with it. Then, they were like we will come again, and up to date they have never come back."
31,2022-09-22,73, **Interviewer**: When did they give you this paper?," **Interviewee**: It was the same week; they wanted to get their money fast so they had to hurry. Because without these papers, they would not have been paid."
31,2022-09-22,74, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you tell them that you weren't going to sign on a thing that wasn't working?, **Interviewee**: Can you read it?
31,2022-09-22,75," **Interviewer**: Okay, ""working but not fully. Single feeding done, revised today and needs monitoring""."," **Interviewee**: When they were giving us this paper, government officials were also there. When we were trying to switch it on, they were also there. And they told us that the people who funded it were also there.... You have said UNDP, right?"
31,2022-09-22,76, **Interviewer**: They came?, **Interviewee**: Yeah! They came!
31,2022-09-22,77," **Interviewer**: Which day? On the day, you were commissioning it? Or, when they came to give you this paper?"," **Interviewee**: On the day, they gave me this paper. It was as if from here they were going to give the contractors there money."
31,2022-09-22,78," **Interviewer**: So after commissioning it, the installers were alone and they told you to try it again at 10 AM the next day. On the day you got this they came with project implementers or funders?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, after we tried it the next day, we reported the issue to the installers. Then, next time they came with this paper and those people. And we told them that we were getting nothing it, and it was better if you had just given us the money, or you should have come with a different thing... We wanted this and we did everything possible to make it work, but there is nothing; people envied us that we got this, but now we are looking like fools. We even told them to switch it on by themselves and see how it was performing, and when they did, it did not even stay for 15 minute and the flame was very little."
31,2022-09-22,79, **Interviewer**: And what did they say?," **Interviewee**: That is why they wrote those remarks. So, I signed because they wrote what happened in the presence of the donors/project implementers."
31,2022-09-22,80," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see!"," **Interviewee**: But if it was my thing, I would have tussled with them and would not have given them the money. The work that was done was not worth of payment. So, if they paid them it's either it was a plot or maybe out of pit considering that they lost money for transportation and all that. So, who ever paid them felt pit for them, but not us."
31,2022-09-22,81, **Interviewer**: Have you seen this \[sheet of intervention\] before?, **Interviewee**: No
31,2022-09-22,82, **Interviewer**: What do you think of this information and do you think it would have helped in your case?," **Interviewee**: I'm going to be repeating what I said. If this digester had worked for one week and stopped, then this information would have helped. But, the problem is that this digester did not work at all. So, this information could not have helped because this thing never worked."
31,2022-09-22,83," **Interviewer**: And if they installers failed to fix it to the point that the project funder came whilst it was still working, it says a lot. It was a big problem."," **Interviewee**: This kind of information can only work after the innovation in question has worked or is working. I'm sure we could have got something like this if it had worked to serve as a reminder... So, money was lost at the end of the day.... And someone stole money\... If they paid them, it was only for the transport cost from Blantyre to here. It was not for the work that was done.... But, if you give them just transport, it can also bring questions, like what was the transportation for, and it can create a lot of issues. So yeah, I think they just gave the people who came that day ""a little something to buy Coca-Cola \[bride\]"" and story was done!"
31,2022-09-22,84," **Interviewer**: Okay, I see. We are going towards the end of interview. How would you describe the current state of you digester?"," **Interviewee**: The digester is completely dead; after laying there for some time certain people pierced the bag with a spear, so it's completely damaged now. Then, after that, we decided to use the bag productively. That's when we decided to use it a roof sheet for our kitchen to protect us from the rains. And, since the people who brought the digester here said, they wanted people to stop using tree for cooking but were not sincere, so we are using the same bag comfortably to do what they came to stop us doing. Instead of minimizing it, I can say they have perpetuated it.... And, I don't know if you researchers do reach out to the people or it just ends in papers. I would have liked us to talk about it whilst I was working. It is sad that we are talking about a thing that is not around. So if it is possible, find out why it never worked, and take appropriate action."
31,2022-09-22,85, **Interviewer**: I have seen you are using the pipes as clotheslines.," **Interviewee**: If they can come again, I can just say just give us clotheslines; we need a different intervention that can work. So, if they can come with a different project, we are willing to work with them. They could come up with solar technology for cooking, then a good project too because it can also conserve the environment."
31,2022-09-22,86," **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end; we have like 5 questions remaining.... I have talked a lot and you have talked a lot, you are saying the installers were mere learners who just wanted to learn. Talking all thins into consideration, why do you think it did not work?"," **Interviewee**: First, they came to learn from us. The installers saw this working somewhere but did not ask about its technicalities or fully understand its technicalities. They just looked at it at face value. So, they came to learn. But the problem is that when they came we thought they were experts and we were going to help us. They failed because they are learners. Or, it failed because they did not want to fix it. Maybe it works on paper, but on ground, it does not work... They gave money to a learner thinking they were giving it to an expert who was going to make it work. When they came, they were like we have also done this in different area, and it's working there, like they knew what they were doing. Nevertheless, they failed. No expert can get zero out of 10...That is no teacher. They had 10 mathematical problems to solve and scored 0. If they scored one we could have said, it is the people to blame. And the learner (installer) himself explained that this area is conducive and that the change was 99% for digester to work because it's a hot area, but he still failed. The installers were like we installed some in the northern region \[cold area\], then we can't fail here. So, you can see they were talking about areas we didn't know. So, I don't if they really managed to install the digesters successfully there."
31,2022-09-22,87, **Interviewer**: How do you meet your energy needs now that is not working?," **Interviewee**: We have gone back to firewood. And, sometimes we do make charcoal. Now, we cut trees, make charcoal and cook. They stole the money from us, so that is what the government wants."
31,2022-09-22,88, **Interviewer**: And you don't feel bad about the environment?," **Interviewee**: I have anger in my heart. If government was a person, I would have grabbed him by the neck to give back my money to use it for cooking...."
31,2022-09-22,89, **Interviewer**: It is tough!," **Interviewee**: Even now, if people ask me and I tell them that you are doing a research on biogas people will think you have nothing to do. That is what people would say."
31,2022-09-22,90, **Interviewer**: (laughs) really?, **Interviewee**: That is true. It could have been nice if we could have showed the biogas while you are doing your thing\... It did not work because it was a plot to steal money from us or because the installers were learners.
31,2022-09-22,91, **Interviewer**: Do you have cows now?,"Now, I don't"
31,2022-09-22,92,What happened to your cows?," **Interviewee**: I sold them last year. Biogas failed first, before losing the cows. I sold the cows because I was going through financial problems. I could not sleep on an empty stomach whilst I had cows"
31,2022-09-22,93,How much did the reactor cost?,"It must be more than K300000. I mean to assembly it and everything took more than K300000, but the bag itself did cost K200000. That is what they told us. They told us that it is very expensive. Though, it looked less expensive to us, but we didn't care about that."
31,2022-09-22,94,Who funded this? UNDP or government, **Interviewee**: I don't know exactly; I think both.
31,2022-09-22,95,Did you contribute anything in kind?,"The biggest thing I contributed was the energy I used to dig the hole. I remember they just told me the dimensions for the hole. Every beneficiary did the digging work on his own. So, when we called them that we were done, they said they were going to come the next day. They came on Saturday to put the bag and they commissioned it on a Tuesday."
31,2022-09-22,96, **Interviewer**: Was there any masonry wait that was involved?," **Interviewee**: They said that some installers line it with a brick wall. They said it is possible line it, even the digestate collection point too. They said they saw it somewhere, and that is why I keep on saying they were learners. They saw some people doing it somewhere and they thought of coming here to do it. Nevertheless, here only one person lined the hole. But, even though he lined it with a brick wall around, nothing worked."
31,2022-09-22,97,What special items how to be imported from another country?,"I don\'t know, or maybe only the pipe. However, it is written that it was made in China, so I think it's from China. I'm not really sure though."
31,2022-09-22,98, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I still have the desired to own an innovation for cooking. So, I would be grateful if they could the intervention again. I think, if an intervention comes again, it would really help save the environment. Therefore, the project installers need to think of ways of helping us again and restoring the environment... Maybe the government thinks that we have biogas; there is no biogas in Nsanje. Still, I think I would do us good if they could bring another intervention, but not this one. And, in all honest and sincerity, I can entertain biogas digesters again. For example, if they decided to bring the digesters to a different EPA, for example, Marka EPA. I could tell them that it\`s a fraud, and that the project implementers are ""big thieves"". If they cannot believe me, I will show them pictures or even ask them to come here and see it yourself, choose. Or, I can ask them just to ask the people of this community to hear about biogas digesters for themselves. And, I would even tell them that they shouldn't bother digging holes for the digesters... More so, I would even go to the point of asking the people to send the project implementers away or come with a different intervention. So, please when you go back to the officials, ask them to bring solar intervention for us. We need to use the solar panels for charging our phone and even for cooking. It is easy because it uses the sun, and once it is installed, it does not require any tiresome work. So, they can bring a stove and even with one light bulb. We cannot complain long as we have energy for cooking. Thus, any intervention can come, but not biogas. Biogas is ""zero"" and people cannot embrace it here. If it can come, people would be saying, ""Have you forgotten 2017?"" Do you want to lose your energy on digging again? Biogas project can never be accepted here in Tengani because the previous one was a total disaster."
31,2022-09-22,99," **Interviewer**: You have answered me my next question. I wanted to ask, if you could have design your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead? You have talked solar"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, solar. But, is there a solar system that can be used for cooking?"
31,2022-09-22,100, **Interviewer**: I think there is.," **Interviewee**: If there is solar system that can be used for cooking, then that is the end of the story - ""solar intervention"". Even if it can have one bulb for lighting, that is okay. We just want an innovation we could use for cooking. And, the fact that it uses solar energy that's a plus because the sun will always be there. Therefore, we want that, not biogas. Biogas is useless. It\`s waste our time! We did put in a lot of effort but in vain. It's meaningless."
31,2022-09-22,101, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas?,"It has no future. It's just one way of stealing money from government. We word biogas is synonym with stealing government money to me. And, I think what UNDP did is not fair, they should have come here like you have done, so that we could tell them how we feel about biogas. I would like to tell them that they blew money on nothing; we did our part but it didn't work. So, thanks for wasting money, we didn't get any help... I feel the one who was coordinating the project, siphoned money from the project! Yeah. That's the message. If you meet UNDP people, tell them we want Solar! And, let me be clear, it's not like the whole government that stole from us, but someone in government stole from us."
31,2022-09-22,102," **Interviewer**: That was my last question. Thanks a lot for your time, and most of coming to the depot to welcome, and for willing to help me locate the other beneficiaries. I am thankful. I am out of words!"," **Interviewee**: In closing, any last words?"
31,2022-09-22,103," **Interviewer**: Thanks too for keeping your word. You said you were going to come today and you have done just that. I understand you said you were going to come earlier but using public transport is not reliable, and being a new place, it's hard. If it was not coming on public, I could not have forgiven you on that. Thanks for coming here, and I have really enjoyed the conversation. To me, I did not feel like interview, and it is not like something I have done before. To me it was more like chat, so thanks.",NA
32,2022-09-22,1, **Interviewer**: Where did this digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: At that time, we were only told that the digesters came through Minister of Agriculture. And, indeed, the installers used to come with people from the agriculture office. I recall it came with \[name redacted\] from the agriculture office. Now she is not staying here. She is in TA Ching'ani. She used to work at Tengani EPA."
32,2022-09-22,2, **Interviewer**: Who built it?,"It was built by a contractor who was told what to do, just like we were. Before the contractor came, we were told to dig the hole, and when he came, he assembled the digester and we did it together. Then, he told us also how to make feedstock of cow manure and water. But, after we completed everything and started the digester work, it didn\'t work. I think it was because the feedstock contained too much water. Of course, the installer told us that after some days, the digester was going to inflate and it did. But, it was not producing gas for long. If it did, it was only for a few days. I mean you could switch it on and only burn for 2 or 3 minutes then go off."
32,2022-09-22,3, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came?," **Interviewee**: The contractor was one but he came with a group of people. I think they came five or six people. I had a paper where they wrote their names and everything, but I lost the paper as I was renovating my house. My wife did not take care of it. All I can remember is that the installation company came as a team, and they were the same people who installed the digesters at Mtolongo."
32,2022-09-22,4, **Interviewer**: How many people from your side participated in the building process?, **Interviewee**: I did the work by myself.
32,2022-09-22,5," **Interviewer**: So, you dug the hole?", **Interviewee**: I dug the hole by myself. They only told me the dimensions of the hole.
32,2022-09-22,6, **Interviewer**: What were the dimensions?," **Interviewee**: I can only remember that it was 1 meter something deep. Ask for the diameter, I\'m not sure, but it was kind of round, maybe 2 meters. They told us that some part containing the manure would be in the hole, while some part would be out of the hole."
32,2022-09-22,7, **Interviewer**: You have told me that during the construction process you were also involved in collection and making of feedstock. How much manure and water did you collect?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we did mix cow manure and water to make the feedstock. I did collect 20 buckets (of 20 liters) of manure."
32,2022-09-22,8, **Interviewer**: Water?, **Interviewee**: It was the same; 20 buckets (20 liters) buckets.
32,2022-09-22,9," **Interviewer**: When was it built? And, how long did it take to build?"," **Interviewee**: It did not take long. They assembled it in a day. Before that, they came to tell us the dimensions of the holes, and that they would come back again. So, when we dug the hole they came with the equipment on the day which they promised."
32,2022-09-22,10, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to dig the hole?, **Interviewee**: It took me two days.
32,2022-09-22,11, **Interviewer**: What was your role apart from what you have said?," **Interviewee**: That was it - digging the hole, collecting manure and water, and making the feedstock."
32,2022-09-22,12," **Interviewer**: In this village, we have many people, so how were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: People were chosen based on handwork. Also, beneficiaries were supposed to have a cow house. Or, the person was supposed to be staying close to someone's cow house for easy access of manure."
32,2022-09-22,13, **Interviewer**: So everyone who was chosen had cows or he had cows within?," **Interviewee**: Everyone who was chosen had a cow house within the house. However, one had cows but his cow house was far from his house. Therefore, it was tough for him to get manure from his cow house, so he was asking from the people around. But, for everyone else it wasn't too difficulty source manure, except for the first day when we started up the digesters. On that day, people went about asking for cow manure from other people because a lot of manure was required at once."
32,2022-09-22,14, **Interviewer**: Did you buy or get it free?, **Interviewee**: I just asked and they gave me free because people saw that it as community thing.
32,2022-09-22,15," **Interviewer**: You are saying people who had cows, and are hard working were chosen. How did they know that you are a hard working?"," **Interviewee**: In a community setting like this, people know each other very well. So, people knew that if I got a digester, I would manage it. That is evident by finding it today where it was installed; if it was given to someone you could not have found it where was installed."
32,2022-09-22,16, **Interviewer**: So you know each other?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we know that if they give this one something, it will only be on paper that he has it, but on ground it will useless and not well taken off."
32,2022-09-22,17, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas as before?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't know anything about biogas. I knew of biogas when they came with the digesters."
32,2022-09-22,18, **Interviewer**: What was the selection process?," **Interviewee**: ""Nomination?"" it happened through chiefs and other community leaders, as a small number of people was required. I think it was only 5 people who were supposed to benefit. So, they thought it was wise to call for a community meeting for transparency. But, it never happened because they thought it was going to create tension since biogas was a new thing and everyone would have wanted it. As a result, the chiefs and community committees congregated and chose the beneficiaries based on the factors I mentioned. After that, they informed the people that a new intervention for cooking was coming to the village."
32,2022-09-22,19, **Interviewer**: How did they inform the people?, **Interviewee**: Through a community meeting at group \[village\] level.
32,2022-09-22,20," **Interviewer**: So, everyone was there when they were announcing the beneficiaries?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, everyone was there. And, if you can show anyone a digester, and ask who benefited from the intervention they would tell you who the beneficiaries were -- ""They will tell you Mkuzi, Faifi, Sewe and Samuel were beneficiaries"""
32,2022-09-22,21," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Nice. So you were just told at the community meeting that the community committee and chief selected you as a beneficiary of biogas? Or, did you participate in the selection process at some point?"," **Interviewee**: No, I was just told at the community meeting that I was a beneficiary for the biogas intervention."
32,2022-09-22,22," **Interviewer**: Why didn't you say no? I mean, why did you accept to build it here?"," **Interviewee**: First, it is because I am a farmer, and I did not want to waste wood."
32,2022-09-22,23, **Interviewer**: What is the connection of a farmer and wood?," **Interviewee**: There is a connection; we use wood mostly for cooking instead of using it for agriculture activities, for example, building of cow house. So, we saw this as an opportunity of saving wood for the construction animals Also, as a farmer, I know cutting down of trees affect rainfall through climate change. So, I did not like the use of firewood cooking because it has negative consequences on agriculture."
32,2022-09-22,24," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were you expectations?"," **Interviewee**: I expected to use biogas ""continuously"" for cooking, yeah!"
32,2022-09-22,25," **Interviewer**: What do you mean ""continuously""?", **Interviewee**: I expected to use it on a daily basis.
32,2022-09-22,26," **Interviewer**: But you are also able to cook with firewood on daily basis, aren't you?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, I do. However, if this had worked, I would have stopped using firewood."
32,2022-09-22,27, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: I do not like using firewood these days because it is very hard for our women to find firewood these days. Therefore, women do struggle and are struggling. It is a burden to women. So, these days most people in this village prefer charcoal because it gives women freedom as we only buy from merchants around the community. But, it needs money so you cannot rely on it. Therefore, when we don\`t have money we simply use maize cobs."
32,2022-09-22,28, **Interviewer**: What did the installers tell you to expect from this?," **Interviewee**: They said upon completion, we would be using it for cooking like an electric stove. On top of that, they said biogas is one way of conserving the environment. That was all."
32,2022-09-22,29, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive from the installers?," **Interviewee**: No, we did not."
32,2022-09-22,30," **Interviewer**: How is that possible? I mean, how would you even be able to switch it on and off?"," **Interviewee**: Everything that was done was on the spot. They were like this is how we dig a hole; this is how we connect to the pipes; this is how we mix cow manure and water to make feedstock; then they said we should find a funnel for transferring feedstock into the digester through the inlet. In regards to starting flame, they said once we see that the bag is full, we could turn on the stove by using matchstick to light of the gas. So, it was not as if we sat down to talk about how it works and all that."
32,2022-09-22,31, **Interviewer**: So after that how prepared to run or operate did you feel you were?," **Interviewee**: After that, we felt confident that we would run and operate it. But, after problems started, we realized there was nothing we knew to remedy the problem. We were helpless. So once we had a problem that time, we just abandon it."
32,2022-09-22,32, **Interviewer**: Why were you helpless?," **Interviewee**: We were hopeless because after installation we never saw their faces again. If I saw them again, it was last year, if not the year before, when people from ""MERA"" came to follow up. So, I told them that for some of us we only used it for few days because we lack expertise to rejuvenate it. Then, we told them other problems too, one of which was they gave us the digesters without training. For them to bring it here, it means they received training on installation and its operate somewhere, so in the same way they should have trained us to know what to do in case of a break downs."
32,2022-09-22,33, **Interviewer**: What did MERA say?," **Interviewee**: They said the contractor was at fault. First, the contractor did not install the digesters properly. Secondly, they faulted the contractor for not giving us training. Thirdly, they said the hole was supposed to be lined with a brick wall around especially at the top surface. They also said the contractor was supposed to make a digestate collection point at the outlet that we could use it as a source of fertilizer."
32,2022-09-22,34, **Interviewer**: I supposed you were told to dig a hole that time for collection for digestate?," **Interviewee**: Yes, they told us."
32,2022-09-22,35, **Interviewer**: Did you dig the hole?," **Interviewee**: Yes, we did. We dug it there"
32,2022-09-22,36," **Interviewer**: So those were the key issues that were supposed to be done. Okay, did you use the digestate?"," **Interviewee**: No, we do not usually use fertilizer here."
32,2022-09-22,37, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: It is tradition and that's what we were taught by our ancestors. Of course, sometimes people do apply manure for vegetables only though. We usually depend on the fertile soil that gets flooded here. So, our soil is fertile."
32,2022-09-22,38," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's great. So, you grow maize without fertilizer.", **Interviewee**: The maize you are seeing here grew without fertilizer.
32,2022-09-22,39, **Interviewer**: It doesn't show any deficiencies?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's always healthy. It is always ""Green"""
32,2022-09-22,40, **Interviewer**: You had the right to say no. Why did you accept to build it here?," **Interviewee**: They discussed it in a way I thought I was going to benefit. First, I thought I going to stop using firewood for cooking. Secondly, my wife would have stopped going to the mountains to get firewood, and thirdly, I thought I would stop damaging the environment."
32,2022-09-22,41," **Interviewer**: I'm seeing a lot of trees around, why don\`t you use that for cooking?", **Interviewee**: I do cut and use the trees.
32,2022-09-22,42," **Interviewer**: Then, why do you go to the mountains to source firewood?"," **Interviewee**: I do use the trees economically. First, I use them for building and rehabilitating my cow house, and that is where most of my trees go. Secondly, I use it for brick clamp making. We use it because it is natural trees so it works well for brick making. Also, you cannot go to the mountains to get wood for that because you would be arrested\... Eh, natural trees are rarely the days so when you have them like this it's desirable."
32,2022-09-22,43," **Interviewer**: I know it didn't work for long, but before it came how did you meet your energy needs?", **Interviewee**: I was using firewood for cooking
32,2022-09-22,44, **Interviewer**: And charcoal?," **Interviewee**: It's only recent that we started using charcoal. All along, we were using firewood"
32,2022-09-22,45," **Interviewer**: Okay, what has changed? What has made you move to charcoal too?", **Interviewee**: It is because of distance. It is far
32,2022-09-22,46," **Interviewer**: Oh, you didn't feel that it was far in the past?", **Interviewee**: It's even farther away from where we used to get wood.
32,2022-09-22,47, **Interviewer**: Meaning that you have exhausted all the trees from where you used to get them?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we have exhausted it."
32,2022-09-22,48, **Interviewer**: And now you go to another place?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, in the past the place we got wood was uninhabited; now the owners have taken down the trees, and build houses and fields. In the past, we could go there, ask for wood and get it. But, now the people cannot give you the wood."
32,2022-09-22,49, **Interviewer**: So people have settled where you used to get firewood?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
32,2022-09-22,50,How much charcoal do you use?,I use a bag of charcoal**.**
32,2022-09-22,51, **Interviewer**: How much is a bag of charcoal?,It is K2500
32,2022-09-22,52,How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: I was doing nothing with it. But, in sweet potato season, I was using it to prepare sweet potato."
32,2022-09-22,53, **Interviewer**: Oh?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but when we are approaching rainy season we take it out, so that when rain comes it does not create mud in the cow house."
32,2022-09-22,54," **Interviewer**: I have always wondered to see people cook cooking sweet potatoes on ash like things; it must be the manure, I guess! Why do you cook on cow manure? How do you do it?"," **Interviewee**: First, you take out very dry manure from the cow house. Then, you gather grass and put the manure on top of the then light it up fire. So, when the fire ignites you bury the sweet potato in the fire."
32,2022-09-22,55, **Interviewer**: Why do you do that? Does it make sweet potato taste better?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it tastes better."
32,2022-09-22,56, **Interviewer**: I should try it one day... Don't people feel disgusting?," **Interviewee**: It's quite okay. You can also wash it, so it's okay. In addition, a lot of heat is involved so it's okay."
32,2022-09-22,57, **Interviewer**: How much manure did you start it up with? You said 20 buckets of cow manure right?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was 20 buckets (20L buckets), or a little more than that. I think it was 25 buckets."
32,2022-09-22,58," **Interviewer**: Okay, water?"," **Interviewee**: It was 20 buckets. Water was a little less because there manure was fresh, so it was watery kind of."
32,2022-09-22,59, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up?, **Interviewee**: I have forgotten how many days it took.
32,2022-09-22,60, **Interviewer**: Maybe a month or two?," **Interviewee**: It didn't reach two months. Maybe, it was a month, if not less."
32,2022-09-22,61, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning? How much cooking time did you get?," **Interviewee**: After we fed it, they told us that they were going to come with a pipe to connect from the bag to the stove. So after some days they came with pipes and the stove, and they installed it. Then, after they went, we tried to use it and it worked but unconvincingly!"
32,2022-09-22,62," **Interviewer**: On the day they commissioned it, did you see flame?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, we did."
32,2022-09-22,63, **Interviewer**: Did you use it for cooking?," **Interviewee**: I cooked on it this other day. I boiled water to make tea. But, as I was cooking nsima, if not dish side, it went off. Still, I have to say I liked the food, which I cooked on. It tasted good."
32,2022-09-22,64, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) Oh," **Interviewee**: That is God's honest truth, the food felt good."
32,2022-09-22,65, **Interviewer**: How did it feel? What was the taste?," **Interviewee**: The milk tea I drunk that day was different from the one from firewood. Of course, it was my first time to use it, but, yeah, it felt different and it was good."
32,2022-09-22,66, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) how did it taste?, **Interviewee**: A cup of tea made from firewood taste smoke-like. While tea made from biogas did not have a smoke-like taste.
32,2022-09-22,67," **Interviewer**: Okay, how much cooking time did you get after commissioning?"," **Interviewee**: I did not use it for an hour from the day it was commissioned. It was always going off. But, the day I made tea, I was very surprised with it; I didn't expect that it works to a point of making tea and even nsima. That day I was able to make tea and cook nsima. While the other days it could not even flame, though the bag was full."
32,2022-09-22,68," **Interviewer**: How did it work from the day it was commissioned,? I want to have a picture.", **Interviewee**: I can say it worked weeks.
32,2022-09-22,69," **Interviewer**: So in those 2, 3, or 4 weeks, were you getting 1 hour of cooking time?"," **Interviewee**: No, only that particular day I made tea, it worked for almost an hour."
32,2022-09-22,70," **Interviewer**: Okay. In your opinion, what happened to that day?", **Interviewee**: I think there was too much pressure in the bag.
32,2022-09-22,71," **Interviewer**: Then, why didn't the pressure keep on?"," **Interviewee**: It is because the sun always shines brightest in summer; during, rainy season it does not shine as in summer."
32,2022-09-22,72, **Interviewer**: Was the sun more intense on that particular day than the other days?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was a hot day."
32,2022-09-22,73, **Interviewer**: When was it installed? Was it in rainy season?," **Interviewee**: No, it wasn't yet the rainy season."
32,2022-09-22,74, **Interviewer**: Do you remember the month?," **Interviewee**: No, I do not. It is only that I have lost the paper I was given, everything was there."
32,2022-09-22,75, **Interviewer**: Were you all installed the digesters around the same time?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
32,2022-09-22,76," **Interviewer**: So, if I have a paper from one it would mean I have the date and some information that is similar like the date of installation and all?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
32,2022-09-22,77," **Interviewer**: Then, I think it was installed in July. I saw the paper from one of the beneficiary. And, yes it makes sense, May to July is winter season here. Thanks.", **Interviewee**: Welcome
32,2022-09-22,78," **Interviewer**: So I can say, you only used the digester once in the few weeks it produced fire. And, you couldn't cook on it because it was producing very little fire and sometimes no fire was coming, right?", **Interviewee**: Very true.
32,2022-09-22,79, **Interviewer**: So the gas was only for cooking?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was for cooking."
32,2022-09-22,80, **Interviewer**: How many people used the gas?, **Interviewee**: We were 7 people.
32,2022-09-22,81, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: For a digester to work it requires locally available materials, for example, cow manure and water. They told us that if we feed the digester with manure and water, the bag inflates and produces gas, which can be light by a matchstick to produce flame for cooking at the stove."
32,2022-09-22,82," **Interviewer**: How often did you feed it, and in what quantities?"," **Interviewee**: I do not really remember how much feedstock, but they said we should be feeding it daily."
32,2022-09-22,83, **Interviewer**: Maybe 5 buckets?," **Interviewee**: No, it wasn't 5 buckets. I think it was 2 buckets. But, they told us to feed it daily."
32,2022-09-22,84, **Interviewer**: How much water were you adding to it?, **Interviewee**: I think I was adding 5 liters of water to each 20kg of cow manure to have suitable slurry.
32,2022-09-22,85, **Interviewer**: So it was a bucket of manure against 5 liters of water?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, think so."
32,2022-09-22,86, **Interviewer**: so you were getting all that manure from your cow house?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
32,2022-09-22,87, **Interviewer**: how many cows did you have that time?, **Interviewee**: I had 15 or 16 cows.
32,2022-09-22,88, **Interviewer**: I'm only seeing here.., **Interviewee**: Some have gone for grazing
32,2022-09-22,89, **Interviewer**: how many in total do you have now?, **Interviewee**: I have 11
32,2022-09-22,90, **Interviewer**: Where did you get water?, **Interviewee**: From a borehole
32,2022-09-22,91, **Interviewer**: Is it within?, **Interviewee**: It is behind that house with iron sheet
32,2022-09-22,92," **Interviewer**: Oh, about 300 meters from here."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, 300 or 400 meters."
32,2022-09-22,93," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did you prepare your feedstock!"," **Interviewee**: We used to mix cow manure and water with a stick. Then, we poured the feedstock into the digester bag through funnel into the inlet pipe."
32,2022-09-22,94, **Interviewer**: Did they provide the provided the funnel...," **Interviewee**: I did not get a funnel, but I made one myself. I was using it when I was pouring feedstock into the digester to avoid wastage."
32,2022-09-22,95," **Interviewer**: Were you told to make one, or you saw that it was necessary?", **Interviewee**: They told us that it was good to use a funnel when putting feedstock into the digester to avoid spillage. So we made one from a 5-liter bottle and it worked perfectly.
32,2022-09-22,96," **Interviewer**: I have talked with a number of people on that subject, but many have told me that they used hands instead of stir sticks or any other mixer because with hands you are able to break lumps or take away debris. What is your take?"," **Interviewee**: If we saw debris, we used to take it out using hands. We could not leave rubbish in the feedstock, because it has the potential of damaging the digester. But, in mixing we used a stick, and it was working quite okay, because we used fresh."
32,2022-09-22,97, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: I was.
32,2022-09-22,98, **Interviewer**: Alone?, **Interviewee**: Yeah!
32,2022-09-22,99, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about feeding it?," **Interviewee**: It was hard work, and people used to call us using the provocative name given to people who collect trash in the city (laughs)"
32,2022-09-22,100, **Interviewer**: (laughs) how did you feel?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) Yeah, but we did not care biogas about that. What we cared about was to cook on biogas. And, we accepted it too because it was what it was; it was true, that's what we were doing!"
32,2022-09-22,101, **Interviewer**: Which people were making fun of you?, **Interviewee**: It was the whole community. They were saying all that because it was new thing to them.
32,2022-09-22,102, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) okay. What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: The installer did not say anything about maintenance. But, when the people from MERA came they said that the installer didn't do what they told him to do. So, they said they were going to have a meeting to find a way forward, so that we could use the digesters again. But since that time, they have never come back."
32,2022-09-22,103, **Interviewer**: When was that? Last year?, **Interviewee**: It was last year.
32,2022-09-22,104," **Interviewer**: What did they say the installers did wrong? Or, they only said they did things badly?"," **Interviewee**: First, they faulted them for not giving us training. Secondly, they said the start up feed was not done correctly. They said the installers used more water than they were supposed to. Thirdly, they said that the design, which was here, was different from their design. They said the design of our digesters required the wall of the hole to be lined with a brick wall."
32,2022-09-22,105, **Interviewer**: How could that have helped?," **Interviewee**: First, it could have helped protected the digester in general. Secondly, it could have helped the bag to expand in a straight manner. Also, the bag would not have been moving anyhow. Moreover, I even saw that our digester bag was shaking on one side, because it had no wall around it. So, if it had a wall on top of hole it could have help to stay in its positioning. And also, the inner sides of the hole were collapsing into the hole because it wasn't lined."
32,2022-09-22,106," **Interviewer**: Yeah, I think it could have helped because I have heard in some cases people put stones on top of the bag to increase pressure. So a brick wall around it would have also helped to push it back, and maybe, yeah."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, the installers told us to put a load on top of the bag to increase pressure when there was little pressure. And, they told us not to worry about the load because when there is too much gas or pressure in the bag it works perfectly even without putting a load."
32,2022-09-22,107," **Interviewer**: During its short life, did you ever get it working when it had an issue?",No
32,2022-09-22,108, **Interviewer**: Did it meet your needs during the time it worked?," **Interviewee**: I was only able to cook on it on the day I made the tea, and I was a very surprised that it worked. I never used it."
32,2022-09-22,109, **Interviewer**: What challenges did you encounter?," **Interviewee**: The main one was that it did not work at all. Secondly, they deprived us of knowledge and skills to manage it."
32,2022-09-22,110, **Interviewer**: What about the fact that people were calling you names?," **Interviewee**: No, that was nothing. You know people always try to bring you down when you have something good."
32,2022-09-22,111," **Interviewer**: Yeah, there is always jealous and all that. You said it produced gas or fire for few weeks, and out of that time, it was only one day that you were able to make tea and cooking nsima. So, I want to have a picture of the days you were not using it, like how was it like when you turned it on?"," **Interviewee**: It was like when you put something on it the fire was going down gradually, and then it would go off."
32,2022-09-22,112," **Interviewer**: In most cases, how long was the fire taking to die?",It was dying in less than 10 minutes.
32,2022-09-22,113," **Interviewer**: When you switched it on again, what was happening?"," **Interviewee**: It was not starting. Sometimes, we could see fire when we light it up again. Sometimes, it was not producing fire at all. Then, we tried feeding it daily like we were told for the first time. But, nothing happened."
32,2022-09-22,114," **Interviewer**: You mean, you tried feeding it throughout the few weeks it misbehaved?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, we used to feed it."
32,2022-09-22,115, **Interviewer**: What happened after that?," **Interviewee**: We did not know what to do. So, we reported the issue to agriculture office because the installers came through their office."
32,2022-09-22,116, **Interviewer**: Some are saying they were given the numbers of the installers. Were you given?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I think they gave us their numbers. Yeah, their numbers were on the paper, they gave us indeed!"
32,2022-09-22,117, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you call them?," **Interviewee**: The digesters were calling us to see how the digesters were performing. And, we told them they weren't working. And, they were okay and they find time they would come."
32,2022-09-22,118, **Interviewer**: Did they come?," **Interviewee**: No. If they came, it was last year."
32,2022-09-22,119, **Interviewer**: The MERA people?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. The installers only came frequently before and during installation. After commissioning, they never came again"
32,2022-09-22,120," **Interviewer**: Okaaay, when you talked with them they were like \`\`we will come, we will come\`\` but, they never did?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
32,2022-09-22,121, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this \[intervention sheet\]?, **Interviewee**: No
32,2022-09-22,122," **Interviewer**: It is information about issues common with digesters, their causes and solutions. What do you think about the information and could it helped your case?", **Interviewee**: It would have a lot because it could have been like our reference for any problem associated with the digester.
32,2022-09-22,123," **Interviewer**: If they gave you that, do you think you could have solved your problem or it was out of your capacity?", **Interviewee**: If our problem was on this information then today you could have found it was.
32,2022-09-22,124, **Interviewer**: Do you know the last time you used it?," **Interviewee**: I do not remember, but it was a few weeks after it was installed. I remember, we used to feed it as we were told, but still it was producing very little or no fire at all, then we gave up after we saw no improvements."
32,2022-09-22,125, **Interviewer**: So you fed it for few weeks after it failed?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
32,2022-09-22,126, **Interviewer**: How would you describe if the current state of your digester?, **Interviewee**: I can simply say it is dead; it is not working.
32,2022-09-22,127, **Interviewer**: Sad!," **Interviewee**: I took off the pipes last year, because I was expecting them to come at some point all those years."
32,2022-09-22,128, **Interviewer**: I have seen people using the pipes as clotheslines; others are using the digester bags as a roof sheet. What are you doing with the material?, **Interviewee**: I have just kept the materials.
32,2022-09-22,129," **Interviewer**: Oh, you have it.", **Interviewee**: Yeah
32,2022-09-22,130, **Interviewer**: Do you think it can work again?," **Interviewee**: Of course, yes. The installers told us that the digester bag has a life span of 15 years. And that it cannot be eaten in 15 years by termites or anything. They said other think could get damaged, but not the bag."
32,2022-09-22,131," **Interviewer**: Did or do you believe that? I mean, can you believe anything from them after what happened?"," **Interviewee**: That time we believed them because we thought they had the expertise. But, now it\`s hard to believe them."
32,2022-09-22,132, **Interviewer**: How did it reach this stage and in your opinion what caused it to fail?," **Interviewee**: Personally, I think it reached this stage because they did not give us training especially on feedstock preparation. In addition, I think it is because they did not give us any training on maintenance."
32,2022-09-22,133," **Interviewer**: If you had received the training, things could have been different?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, maybe today we would have been talking about our shortfalls."
32,2022-09-22,134, **Interviewer**: So you think you did do anything wrong in regards to its failure?, **Interviewee**: I do not see anything we did wrong. We did everything as we were told.
32,2022-09-22,135," **Interviewer**: Okay, we are going towards the end of the interview. So nowadays, you meet your energy needs by firewood and charcoal?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
32,2022-09-22,136," **Interviewer**: As for manure, you just keep and remove when it is close to the rainy season?", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
32,2022-09-22,137, **Interviewer**: Where do you dispose it?, **Interviewee**: We just burn it in the cow house.
32,2022-09-22,138, **Interviewer**: Why do you burn it there?," **Interviewee**: Because that kills, some of the parasites, for example, ticks."
32,2022-09-22,139, **Interviewer**: Okay great. How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: They did not tell us anything about its actual cost. They simply said that the digester was expensive.
32,2022-09-22,140, **Interviewer**: Okay. Who paid for that?," **Interviewee**: I think it was the government, but they got the digesters in Kenya. The digesters came from Kenya."
32,2022-09-22,141, **Interviewer**: The installers told you that?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
32,2022-09-22,142," **Interviewer**: What kind of special items that had to be imported from another country? Or, was it all from Kenya? Or, which things are from Malawi?"," **Interviewee**: I'm not 100% sure, where they got it from. But, the people who installed it are Malawians."
32,2022-09-22,143," **Interviewer**: During the time you had it, did it help you to save any money or did you stop going to search for wood or charcoal?"," **Interviewee**: No, nothing changed. Not a bit!"
32,2022-09-22,144, **Interviewer**: We are remaining with 3 questions. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: My opinion of biogas is that if it is possible for the installers to rehabilitate it, then they should do so because we would like to atleast see how it works. And, after rehabilitation they shouldn't forget to train us on it... They should drill us on maintenance so that we can be able to fix it on our own."
32,2022-09-22,145, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas?," **Interviewee**: When I think of the day I used it, then I have to say it is doable. However, it needs to be good installed; it's need experienced installers. So, this can have a future if and only if it there can be organization in the manner of its installation."
32,2022-09-22,146, **Interviewer**: What do you mean organization?," **Interviewee**: They should take us through proper training just like a school itself. For example, they should be like this is the letter ""A"", this is how we write the letter ""A"" and then they should make us write the letter ""A"" on our own. I think this way things can work.... But, the time they came, they just said this is how we write the letter ""A"". So we didn't know the ""A"" and let alone how to write it. That's why were stranded.... Take for example electricians, they go for 2 or 3 year training. After that, they go for practicals or attachments. That helps the trainers to know or assess the students. So with this one, it would have helped and worked, if they had given us a 2 or 3 days training. I\`m sure, out of 5 people, 2 or 3 people would have gained the expertise to manage it, and the knowledge would have then spread to the community."
32,2022-09-22,147," **Interviewer**: Yeah, you have a point because they say you know a good football player on the field, and not in training. So, you were supposed to go through hands on training and an evaluation process too. If you could have designed your own waste or any energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: We have seen people using LPG gas, so I think it is a good alternative of biogas. So, if we could have that opportunity we would be thankful and we can manage it without issues. I cannot say solar panels because I have not seen people using them for cooking. And I'm sure if a solar panel was capable of producing energy for cooking, then the problem of deforestation couldn't have been an issue because everyone has a solar panel now."
32,2022-09-22,148," **Interviewer**: I see. Any last words, before ending we end interview."," **Interviewee**: My word goes to government. If they start a project they shouldn\`t just abandon it, they need to follow up. If this project was followed-up for the first 3 months, I'm sure the digesters could have been working now. They just disposed the digesters here and then after 2 or 3 years they went back to their papers and decided to come back. There was no way they could have found the digesters working. They took too long to follow-up."
32,2022-09-22,149, **Interviewer**: That\`s true. Thanks for the interview.,NA
33,2022-09-22,1,"First, where did this originate from?"," **Interviewee**: They gave us a paper, which had information regarding that, but I don't know where the paper is now. We have moved from one house to another a lot for a couple of years, so it\`s hard to get track of things. And, I have not only lost the paper. My ID is also missing. And, it's unfortunate that when they gave me the paper I didn't scrutinize it much to the point that I could keep the information in my head."
33,2022-09-22,2," **Interviewer**: So you don't know where it came from, but they gave you a paper that had that information?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
33,2022-09-22,3, **Interviewer**: Who designed it?," **Interviewee**: I don't know who designed it. Maybe, the other beneficiaries know or have the paper I'm talking about. But, I remember that I dug the hole, and I also made the feedstock by myself. I was only told how to do the tasks though. They told me that after preparing the feedstock, I should feed the digester and that after sometime I was going to see the bag inflated."
33,2022-09-22,4, **Interviewer**: How many people dug the hole?," **Interviewee**: I did it alone. The project installers only came to place the bag, assemble the pipes and stove."
33,2022-09-22,5, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came?, **Interviewee**: It was 4 people.
33,2022-09-22,6, **Interviewer**: How many people were involved in the preparation of the feedstock?, **Interviewee**: I sourced manure with my wife.
33,2022-09-22,7, **Interviewer**: Where did you get it?, **Interviewee**: I went into other people's cow house to collect manure. Some people gave me 2 bags and I got the rest from other different people.
33,2022-09-22,8, **Interviewer**: So you didn't have cows that time?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. I didn't have a cow house. So, some gave me for free; some people sold us the manure at K1000 a bag."
33,2022-09-22,9," **Interviewer**: How was it like going to ask you for manure? I mean, did other people say no?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, some people said they couldn't give us for free. So, they sold us 2 bags at K1000 each... But, we used the digester for 5 days."
33,2022-09-22,10, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to build it altogether?," **Interviewee**: It took me one day to dig the hole. It also took them a day to place the digester. And, it took them 3 days to come and assemble the pipes and the stove, and then start it."
33,2022-09-22,11," **Interviewer**: So, after starting it you saw fire."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it worked."
33,2022-09-22,12," **Interviewer**: So, in brief what was your role?"," **Interviewee**: That was all; I dug the hole, sourced and made feedstock. After installation, I found that biogas is a good thing; it's fast especially when cooking side dish. And, out of all the beneficiaries in this village, only my digester worked. I mean, I asked all my friends how their digesters were faring and they responded that their digesters weren't working."
33,2022-09-22,13," **Interviewer**: Oh, nice. Why do you think your digester worked while others failed?"," **Interviewee**: I think it was how we worked; some people were told to collect 50 buckets cow manure and could not manage. Some, instead of using fresh manure were using dry manure. And, indeed, after feeding it the first time the installers said our digester was going to work, and it worked."
33,2022-09-22,14," **Interviewer**: And, you saw the fire?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, everything was good, and I even roasted maize afterwards."
33,2022-09-22,15," **Interviewer**: And, were roasted nicely?", **Interviewee**: Very good.
33,2022-09-22,16, **Interviewer**: After that?," **Interviewee**: I cooked side dish. The next day, it worked in the afternoon. But, it didn't work in the morning and late hours of the afternoon because it needs the sun."
33,2022-09-22,17," **Interviewer**: In this village, there are so many people, even 300 households. How were you selected as a beneficiary was?"," **Interviewee**: Before getting into the biogas project, I was in a road construction project. Before moving to biogas project, they told me I was going for 9-day training, and I accepted. When they gave us the digesters, they told us it was a pilot project, so people wanted to see who was going to be most successful. So, it brought a competitive spirit among the beneficiaries. And, some beneficiaries were doing things steady but sure, while others were doing things in haste to show that they were successive. So out of all the beneficiaries, I was the one who managed to make it work."
33,2022-09-22,18," **Interviewer**: So, you were chosen because you are a hard worker?", **Interviewee**: I was a hard worker.
33,2022-09-22,19," **Interviewer**: Oh, you stopped working hard?"," **Interviewee**: No, but I was pulled off by the fact that the digester couldn't work for a long time when there was no sun."
33,2022-09-22,20," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you know about biogas before?"," **Interviewee**: No, I was expecting to learn about biogas at the 9-day training, but it never happened."
33,2022-09-22,21," **Interviewer**: So, before they came you didn't know anything about biogas, but you expected to learn about it at the 9-day training, but it never materialized?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
33,2022-09-22,22," **Interviewer**: You have mentioned how you were moved from the road project to biogas project. How were the other beneficiaries chosen? I mean, who selected you to move from the road project to the biogas project? What was the selection process like?"," **Interviewee**: we had a community meeting at the senior chief's residence, that\'s where they chose as beneficiaries, and the people bore witness. I mean, when it was time for the people of Mcheleka to choose a beneficiary, I was chosen by the people, since I'm a resident of Mcheleka village and the people saw that I was skilled enough to run it and be exemplary to the community. Then, I was like fine, write my name."
33,2022-09-22,23, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you say no?, **Interviewee**: Saying no would have meant that I had also rejected my chief.
33,2022-09-22,24," **Interviewer**: (laughs) oh, you didn't want to shame your chief?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) yeah, I didn\'t want to embarrass him."
33,2022-09-22,25," **Interviewer**: If I have had you correctly, you have said the people of your village. Do you mean there were people from different villages?"," **Interviewee**: At the community meeting, there were seven chiefs from different villages with their people under one Senior Chief. So, because they wanted five beneficiaries, three villages were taken as one village. Then, they told us that there was a project, and whoever was interested was welcome to submit their names. Many people didn't give their names because; they didn't want to handled cow manure regularly; some people didn't like smell of cow manure, so they thought biogas was worth all that. At that point, people were not told that they would go for training. People were only told that there was a project called biogas, its requirements and that the digesters address cooking needs, and whoever was interested was welcome to give their name... Then, the chief told me that they were moving me from the road construction project to biogas project, as I could not be involved in both projects. But, I was hesitant to move because I was not sure if the training was going to happen. Then, he assured the all the beneficiaries that we would go for training on biogas, and I accepted to move. And, I everyone saw my name taken out of the road project to the biogas project. So, that's how I was selected, and after some time the digester came."
33,2022-09-22,26," **Interviewer**: What was the road project about? And, what is your role?"," **Interviewee**: It was a community built road project by MASAF, and I was earning K18,000 each month for taking part in building community roads."
33,2022-09-22,27, **Interviewer**: so you accepted to let go K18000?," **Interviewee**: Yes, but that was not a problem since I'm a fisherman, I make K2000 a day when I go to the river to fish. So, I make K15000 a month."
33,2022-09-22,28, **Interviewer**: It's K60000," **Interviewee**: (laughs) yeah, it's K60000."
33,2022-09-22,29," **Interviewer**: That's a lot! Interesting, you have touched on an interesting subject for me. I remember one time I was working with a certain NGO on wash project. So, I was involved in creating and strengthening water point committees. During that time, I observed that when you are working with community people, if you want to get them engaged or get full attention, you have to bring in the element of training. It's was surprising to see how people would put in effort and so much interest in tasks once you mentioned training. I will put it to you, why are community people so interested in trainings?"," **Interviewee**: That's very true.....That time this was commissioned many people came to see me roasting maize. People were taking videos and pictures, and they commended me for the good work."
33,2022-09-22,30, **Interviewer**: (laughs) amazing. But you haven't answered my question. I want to know why community people get so enthusiastic about projects once you tell them that one day you're going to take them for training? Why are community people so obsessed with trainings?," **Interviewee**: I can say community people become interested in projects depending on how the whole project is introduced. If you tell them that a project has no component of training they accept and the work without issues. But, once you tell them that a project will involve trainings people become even more interested because we know they will get ""something out"" at the end of training."
33,2022-09-22,31," **Interviewer**: So it's about the money, the training allowances to some extent?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
33,2022-09-22,32, **Interviewer**: Did you receive any training? What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't receive."
33,2022-09-22,33," **Interviewer**: You didn't know about biogas before, then how were you able to switch it on and off, if you didn\`t receive trainings?"," **Interviewee**: On the day of commissioning the digester, they just said \`friend\` we have switched it on, how did we do that? So, I saw them taking a matchstick and lighting the burners after opening the gas valve and turning the control knob at the stove, therefore I did the same. I didn't go for training."
33,2022-09-22,34, **Interviewer**: What else?," **Interviewee**: An, I was also told how to make feedstock as they were installing it."
33,2022-09-22,35, **Interviewer**: How prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were after all that?," **Interviewee**: Very much so! I saw them turning it on and off, and they told me what to do once there was no gas in the bag as well. So, I knew that I would be able to run it because I had gained knowledge to run it, though without the training."
33,2022-09-22,36, **Interviewer**: What did they tell you to do when there was no gas?," **Interviewee**: There were two things to look at when there was no gas production. First, we had to see if there was the sun or not, because it doesn\'t produce gas when there is no sun; when it's hot like this, it produces gas. Secondly, if the sun was out, then we had to feed it with feedstock at the inlet pipe to produce gas."
33,2022-09-22,37," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: I would have been very happy today to see it working because I couldn't be using firewood for cooking. Now, I have no expectation of it working again because some people punctured it, and my children punctured it at some point as well. So, it is sad and it hurts to see my wife suffering sourcing firewood. So, I hope to have it again one day."
33,2022-09-22,38, **Interviewer**: What did the installers tell you to expect from this?," **Interviewee**: I'm not sure if they were saying some of the things just to make us pumped up, so that we could make their work easy. I remember they told us that they didn't want us to handle feedstock with bare hands. So, they promised us gloves, work suit, wheelbarrows, gumboots and shovels. They didn't give us all that, but that wasn't a problem because we managed to prepare feedstock effectively with our bare hands. Still, it wasn't easy to pick manure with hands, so at some point I only managed to buy a shovel to help me in collecting fresh manure."
33,2022-09-22,39, **Interviewer**: At what price?," **Interviewee**: It was K4000, I think."
33,2022-09-22,40," **Interviewer**: So, you expected to cook without sourcing wood, and you expected to get items like gloves and work suits and all. Apart from these, what else did you expect or what else were you told to expect?", **Interviewee**: That was that.
33,2022-09-22,41, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: Before that, I was using an energy efficient stove given to us by Goal Malawi. However, the stoves were not durable, so we didn't use it for long. After that, I was using a two-hole firewood stove given to us by DAPP \[Development Aid From People To People\]."
33,2022-09-22,42, **Interviewer**: What's wrong with those stoves \[points to the stoves\]?," **Interviewee**: It's like when you use it for 2 weeks or so, it develops a crack and it eventually breaks into two."
33,2022-09-22,43," **Interviewer**: Oh,"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and when it does that you can't fix it."
33,2022-09-22,44, **Interviewer**: I can imagine that throughout this time you used firewood for cooking. Where did you get?, **Interviewee**: We exchange firewood with sweet potato with women from the hillside.
33,2022-09-22,45, **Interviewer**: So they come here and you do exchange?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we make heaps of sweet potatoes and say this heap is, for example, K1000, and they make bundles of firewood and tag a price to it, and then we balance up. So, that's how we exchange firewood with sweet potato."
33,2022-09-22,46," **Interviewer**: So, how was it like around the 5 days you used the digester? Did you send them back?"," **Interviewee**: Nothing changed because the digester was only working in the afternoon, so at night we still needed firewood."
33,2022-09-22,47," **Interviewer**: You said you didn't have cows or any livestock, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
33,2022-09-22,48, **Interviewer**: Do you have now?, **Interviewee**: No.
33,2022-09-22,49," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did you do it after commissioning?"," **Interviewee**: After the digester bag got full, the installers came. When they came, they called me to observe what they were doing. First, they opened gas valves and I had heard a certain sound indicating gas movement. Then, they asked me to get matchstick but I did not have, so I asked my little child to buy. When we got matchstick, they opened the stove and lighted the burner. Then, they asked me what I wanted to cook, so I told them I wanted roasted maize, and put maize on the stove. When people saw what was happening they started coming one by one to see me roasting maize on biogas. While, I was roasting maize people were saying that I had hit a jackpot. We managed to roast the maize, and I shared it with the people to eat. Some people from Mozambique even came to see me roasting maize."
33,2022-09-22,50," **Interviewer**: Approximately, how many people came, and what was their reaction?"," **Interviewee**: It was a lot of people. I don't know how many people. It was a lot. People from the upper side of the village came to see the whole thing. People from Mozambique when passing by, were even coming to see what was happening."
33,2022-09-22,51, **Interviewer**: What did they say?, **Interviewee**: They liked it and wanted to have one too.
33,2022-09-22,52, **Interviewer**: How much cooking time did you get after that?," **Interviewee**: The next day, I cooked dry fish and nsima \[approximately one hour of cooking time\] in the afternoon. But, when I was trying to cooking nsima in the evening, it didn't work (laughs)"
33,2022-09-22,53, **Interviewer**: How did you feel?," **Interviewee**: I kind of expected that because the installers told us that it wouldn't work in the evening. They said they would bring some equipment that was going to enable us to cook in the evening and to use it for lighting as well. So, we expected that, but they never came with the equipment."
33,2022-09-22,54," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. Uh, they gave you their numbers, I mean, did you follow up on this prospect?"," **Interviewee**: I called them, but their numbers didn't go through. So, I went to the extension worker to ask, and he told me that he was also trying them but the calls weren't going through. I asked him if they had blocked us, but he told me that he had no idea. Then, he went on to say that, they were going to come back at some point, so I shouldn't worry. So, I think this is the day, praise be to God (laughs)."
33,2022-09-22,55," **Interviewer**: (laughs) I don\`t even know how to install a digester, brother. How did you use the gas? Was it for cooking only?", **Interviewee**: I was also using it for cooking.
33,2022-09-22,56, **Interviewer**: How many people used the gas?, **Interviewee**: We were 6 people.
33,2022-09-22,57, **Interviewer**: So have said you only used it for 5 days?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
33,2022-09-22,58, **Interviewer**: How was cooking like in those 5 days?, **Interviewee**: It was somewhat similar; I was only using it in the afternoon.
33,2022-09-22,59, **Interviewer**: Can you quantify the cooking time you were getting? How many hours did you get in the afternoon?, **Interviewee**: It was 1 hour or so.
33,2022-09-22,60, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?, **Interviewee**: One of the gentlemen whose name was on the documentation paper told us that we would require cow manure and water.
33,2022-09-22,61, **Interviewer**: What else was required?, **Interviewee**: That was all.
33,2022-09-22,62," **Interviewer**: So, what were you supposed to do with cow manure and water?"," **Interviewee**: To start it up, they told me that I should mix six bags of cow manure with 100 liters of water. So that day I woke up at 4:00 a.m. and started searching for manure. I went to \[name redacted\] house, and then I went to \[name redacted\] house to pick manure, though he was a beneficiary too. He didn't hold back because he was my father in law. But, when I went to \[name redacted\] house, he told me that he couldn't give the manure for free. So, I bought him. I think I paid him K1000. I did this job with my wife, while my children were collecting water. After we got enough water and cow manure, we mixed it and then poured it in the digester."
33,2022-09-22,63, **Interviewer**: I have heard about \[name redacted\] the other beneficiary. I heard his whole family was murdered in the most gruesome way. How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: What happened was bizarre. I can't just figure out how some people would do that. Talking of feedstock, we were placing cow manure in a bucket, add water and then mix with bare hands, like my hands are now, since we didn't have gloves. Whenever we saw lumps, we crushed them to have a smooth feedstock. After making smooth and slightly thick slurry, I used to pour it in the digester. I finished the work around 9 AM, and around 11 AM it started making a certain sound, then after some days the bag got full and I hit it with my fingers it was producing a bell like sound. So, I knew there was gas in the bag, but after some days, it was punctured."
33,2022-09-22,64, **Interviewer**: You said people at some point punctured your digester. Why do you think they did that? Was it out of jealous or anything?," **Interviewee**: I can't know because that time I was away on my fish trip. The problem was that my house was close to a footpath. As a result, the installers also placed the digester close to the footpath, so it was easy for people to puncture it. So you never know people, until you dine with them. Thus, some day we found it punctured because of jealousy. But, I've seen have beneficiary cutting it on purpose to make makeshift doors or roofing sheets (laughs). Then, I heard all the people from Kachere cut the digesters because they were useless. But, I was happy that out of all the people here I was the one who used it for long."
33,2022-09-22,65, **Interviewer**: Only for 5 days?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and even if the installers come and do an evaluation, people would see that I was the one who performed best among all the beneficiaries."
33,2022-09-22,66, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) I think 5 days is just too little to say you use it.," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) But, if you compare with my colleagues, that\`s success."
33,2022-09-22,67, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) who was responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: I was responsible.
33,2022-09-22,68, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about feeding it? Didn't you found it involving?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't find it involving because I knew that was the only way that would stop us from sourcing firewood. And, it was exciting for me to use a modern technology for cooking, though I was only able to cook in the afternoon."
33,2022-09-22,69," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were the maintenance requirements?","They said if the problem was at the stove, we should call them. But, if there was gas leakage on the bag or anywhere, then we could seal the punctured place ourselves with an adhesive. Then, I asked them if it was necessary for us to buy an adhesive since they told us that they would provide anything for us. Then they just said if there was a leakage, we should inform them. Then, we had problems and called them, but they didn't come. So, we knew that it was up to us to maintain it, and that's why many beneficiaries abandoned it when they faced a problem, because we didn't know what to do."
33,2022-09-22,70, **Interviewer**: You have said it stopped working after 5 days. How did it stop? Did it go off at once or something?," **Interviewee**: It stopped working after 5 days because the weather changed. It became cloudy and cold. Then, after some days, the sun came out, but my wife didn't switch it on."
33,2022-09-22,71, **Interviewer**: You weren't around that time?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was away. When I was leaving, I told my wife that I'm going for a business trip, use it when the sun is back and when the bag is full. But, my wife is illiterate, so she didn't pay attention to what I told her regarding its operation. So, she didn't use it."
33,2022-09-22,72, **Interviewer**: Do you think it needs someone who has gone to school?," **Interviewee**: Yes, school helps a lot because it makes people to understand things easily."
33,2022-09-22,73," **Interviewer**: Okay, so I those 5 days, did you meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: After it worked for 5 days, I went for a business trip a day after. Then, when I was away, my wife called and told me that the sun didn't come out and the bag was deflated. Then, I told her that once the sun was out the digester bag would inflate. The next day, the sun rose, and she told me that the sun was out, but she admitted that she didn\`t know how to operate it. Then, I told her not to bother and let it be, so she didn't use it. Then, later that night I think some people took advantage that I wasn't around, and punctured it. Then, she informed me that people had punctured it."
33,2022-09-22,74," **Interviewer**: So, it took about 6 or 7 days for people to puncture it? (Laughs)", **Interviewee**: (Laughs) Yeah.
33,2022-09-22,75, **Interviewer**: Jealousy people!, **Interviewee**: Some people weren't happy to see me use it.
33,2022-09-22,76, **Interviewer**: Why do you think some would just come and puncture your digester bag?," **Interviewee**: Our \[Sena\] tribe is hard to understand. It's different from people from the north \[Tumbuka tribe\]. People from the north are united; no one feels more or less important than the next person; and they support each other. People here just not like to see others doing well in life. Here you cannot get support from anyone, excerpt from very close friends. Even people who you went to school are always jealousy of your success. Jealousy is just too much here!"
33,2022-09-22,77, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of our interview. What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: We faced many challenges; one was that we did not receive training. Another problem was that unknown people punctured the digester. Secondly, it was hard for us to take it out of the house when we were told to moving out of the house by our landlord. So, you can see the challenges were just too many."
33,2022-09-22,78," **Interviewer**: I'm also thinking of the challenge you had with it when it came to cooking during evening.... Wasn't it producing fire at all? Or, it was producing very little fire?"," **Interviewee**: It wasn't producing fire at all, zero!"
33,2022-09-22,79," **Interviewer**: They told you if it had a puncture, you could seal it using an adhesive. Did you try to fix it after people punctured it?"," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't because we moved to another house. But, before we moved, children who liked to play around it also cut it. And this made the problem bigger than the first one. The first one, I could have tried to seal it with an adhesive. But, the second one was so big that I couldn't even dare to try (Laughs)."
33,2022-09-22,80," **Interviewer**: (laughs) and, even if you could have fixed it, they could have come back again.", **Interviewee**: (laughs) very possible.
33,2022-09-22,81, **Interviewer**: Have you seen that before?, **Interviewee**: No.
33,2022-09-22,82," **Interviewer**: This is information regarding problems common on digesters. For example, it tells you if it's not producing fire, It is because of this and that, and it also tells you it's possible solutions. What do you think of this information and would it have helped in your case?"," **Interviewee**: If they couldn\'t manage to give us training, then they would have at least given as that information. With that information we could have at least had understand of it. But, sadly, they just gave us their names and phone numbers to call, and their number didn't even work."
33,2022-09-22,83," **Interviewer**: (Laughs) it's sad. Today is 22^nd^ of September, if the installers can call you today and ask you describe the current state of your digester, what do you say?"," **Interviewee**: I can tell them straight forward that the digester is now part of my roof structure, it's a roof sheet now! I can't keep words from them (Stops speaking to attend to a visitor)"
33,2022-09-22,84, **Interviewer**: (laughs) so you can tell them open now that it's a roof sheet now?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) I can't tell them that, it's rude. Ah, I can't say that, I can only tell them that the digester is not working. But, we have the materials."
33,2022-09-22,85, **Interviewer**: Where are the materials?," **Interviewee**: The digester bag is on top of the roof, and other things are in the house."
33,2022-09-22,86, **Interviewer**: I will see all that at the end. How do you meet your energy needs now that it is not working?, **Interviewee**: Now we use firewood.
33,2022-09-22,87, **Interviewer**: Charcoal? Do you use charcoal?," **Interviewee**: Honestly speaking, I don't use charcoal. I remember this other time forest officials caught me with two bags of charcoal as I was passing through a roadblock. I told them that I didn't make the charcoal, but I only bought it, and they told that was still an offense by forest laws. So, they took the two bags from me, so from there on I don't buy charcoal."
33,2022-09-22,88," **Interviewer**: Don't people come here to sell charcoal here? I mean, with that you can't still use charcoal because it's not like they come into the houses to check if you have charcoal?"," **Interviewee**: No, some women sell maize cobs at a certain place within the village, so when we don't have firewood, as it is the case now, we go there to buy the maize cobs. They come around 5:00 PM, we could have gone together to see what happens, if you had time. So, that's what we use."
33,2022-09-22,89, **Interviewer**: So you use that for cooking as well!, **Interviewee**: Yeah!
33,2022-09-22,90, **Interviewer**: We are about to finish our interview; we have five more questions to go. How did reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: They said it was K200000.
33,2022-09-22,91, **Interviewer**: Who paid for that?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I have forgotten. But, if I had the paper, you could have seen. I always make digital copies of such papers and put in my phone, but I don't know why I didn't do so that time."
33,2022-09-22,92," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you contribute anything in kind?"," **Interviewee**: I contributed nothing. I didn't give them any like a chicken or something. But, I did kill a chicken for them to eat while they were working."
33,2022-09-22,93," **Interviewer**: Good hospitality, uh!"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) yeah! I was like to these are my visitors let's support each other. So, I got a chicken and cooked it for them!"
33,2022-09-22,94," **Interviewer**: You killed a chicken for nothing, uh (laughs)"," **Interviewee**: Ah, no. I didn't want them to go hungry, despite the fact they were getting allowances (laughs)"
33,2022-09-22,95," **Interviewer**: That's so kind of you. Next time, I will tell you well in advance that I'm coming when I get you number. The number I had of you didn't work. I want a chicken here next time like them! Moving on, you have said you dug the hole alone, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
33,2022-09-22,96," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you line it with plaster or a brick wall?", **Interviewee**: No. It's was just a round hole.
33,2022-09-22,97, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that you could line it?," **Interviewee**: Yes, they did. They said whoever could manage to buy a bag of cement should do so to protect soil from collapsing into the hole. But, we didn't do that because our bag was well placed and fitted perfectly into the hole. So, we only stacked bricks around it to prevent debris from getting into the hole."
33,2022-09-22,98, **Interviewer**: You just stack the bricks?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and at the outlet, I made a hole without lining it with plaster or a brick wall. The hole was for collecting digestate."
33,2022-09-22,99, **Interviewer**: Did you use the digestate?, **Interviewee**: No.
33,2022-09-22,100, **Interviewer**: Why? They didn't tell you that you could use it?," **Interviewee**: We thought that when the digestate stays in the hole for some days it loses value, and became useless."
33,2022-09-22,101," **Interviewer**: But, people who use manure keep manure for some time before using it. So, didn't you think it was kind of the same? Why didn't you use it as fertilizer?"," **Interviewee**: Our fields are very far away from here. But, if we had gardens around then you would have been using it. We found it tiresome to carry a bag of digestate there. Our farms are not within this community, they are in Mozambique."
33,2022-09-22,102, **Interviewer**: So you mean you don't carry a bag of fertilizer there?," **Interviewee**: The people here don't use fertilizer. Maybe, others don't, but a lot of people don't. It's only in Chidisi where people use fertilizer. But, here I don't think so, and I have never seen a person using manure."
33,2022-09-22,103, **Interviewer**: Why don't people use fertilizer or manure?," **Interviewee**: The soil here is so fertile. When we plant maize, it grows well, and it produces strong maize cobs with big ears."
33,2022-09-22,104," **Interviewer**: Oh, you are lucky. People are stressing over fertilizer in some areas.", **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
33,2022-09-22,105, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country? i.e. did they tell you were the materials came from?," **Interviewee**: They said the digester is from my abroad. They also said the donor was international as well. So, urged us to take good care of it."
33,2022-09-22,106," **Interviewer**: They just said the donor was international, but they didn't say the name?"," **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us the name of the donor. They only said the donor was international and that one day he would come. They went on to say that, only 10 people from two villages of Mtologo and Kachere were the beneficiaries."
33,2022-09-22,107," **Interviewer**: Did you save any money in those 5 days it worked? If so, how much money?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, I saved some money. I mean, when I wanted to buy firewood and cook, I was spending K500 per day; one for lunch, and the other for supper. So, in those days, I can say I was saving K250 a day, which I used to buy soap and other things."
33,2022-09-22,108," **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas? When you hear of biogas, what comes into your mind?"," **Interviewee**: When I had biogas, I was like in a different world. Of course, I was able to use it in the afternoon only; still it gave my wife an opportunity to rest. I wasn't seeing my wife going around searching for firewood as I used to. So, it gave us rest and our lives were better"
33,2022-09-22,109," **Interviewer**: So, it's a good thing?", **Interviewee**: Right?
33,2022-09-22,110, **Interviewer**: Its drawbacks?," **Interviewee**: It\`s what I have already said. If the bag deflates, it doesn't produce strong fire."
33,2022-09-22,111, **Interviewer**: I though you only need to feed it to keep the bag inflated?," **Interviewee**: It\'s not possible to keep it full all the times because we don't feed it daily. They told us to feed it after every two days, so we couldn't keep the bag full all the times. When we fed it, the gas didn't stay long to go to the next day, so it's a big challenge."
33,2022-09-22,112, **Interviewer**: Oh! What is the future biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: I believe, if I wasn't travelling a lot, I would have managed to move with it from house to house. So, my travels resulted in its failure. Also, the fact it was punctured by people made it not to last long."
33,2022-09-22,113," **Interviewer**: But, we are talking about 10 people who were given to run it and hoping that the community would adopt it. But, all 10 people, including you failed to manage it, so do you think you would have managed it?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I mean out of the 10 people, I was the best and my friends were even saying that I tried managed and make it work. So if it was to work, I was the only person who would have made it work here. But, my going in and out are the cause of its failure. So, I think it just need close attention from both the installers and the users to make it work."
33,2022-09-22,114," **Interviewer**: Last question, okay, if you could have decided your own energy or waste intervention, what would you have chosen instead?","There are a lot of technologies that are coming into the country. Whatever it be wind powered energy interventions or solar powered interventions, which can be used for cooking. So, I can go for such interventions, and I can give my all to make it work."
33,2022-09-22,115, **Interviewer**: Why such interventions?, **Interviewee**: There are reliable because the wind will always be there. The sun will always be there.
33,2022-09-22,116, **Interviewer**: That's the end; do you have anything to say?," **Interviewee**: I would to thank you for coming with your research. I'm so glad you have come. In regards to biogas, it has been many years without people coming to follow up on this, so we are thank for that. And, I have to say we feel like we have unfinished business with biogas, and we would like to maybe use it someday."
33,2022-09-22,117," **Interviewer**: Thanks for the interview, and I appreciate for sharing your time with me. I have hold your for long, I saw that you were going for a football game, hope I haven't taken much of your time."," **Interviewee**: It's okay, and the game hasn't started yet, so it's fine."
34,2022-09-23,1, **Interviewer**: Where did this digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: The project implementers came from Lilongwe. I have forgotten the name of their organization though, But, they came here with agriculture extension workers. They said the aim of their coming was to install digesters, which use cow manure for cooking. Then, they asked us to do some work which took us 2 weeks. First, they told us to mix cow manure and water. So, we found 5 bags (50 kgs) of fresh cow manure. Then, we closed the outlet and inlet pipes, so that the reactor could produce gas. We were told that the reactor needs the sun, like it is shining now to produce gas. Then, they went on to say the digester bag inflates once it has gas that burns and produce flame for cooking. After that, we dug a hole of 2 meters wide and 5 meters deep, I think. Then, we waited for 2 weeks, but when we tried it didn't work. The fire was very little that we could not use. Therefore, I think something went wrong. After that, they came again and we told them that it wasn't working as we could not cook on it or even boil water for bathing. Then, they told us that the hole needed to be lined with a brick wall to insulate or heat the bag. We told them we couldn't manage to get cement, but we could manage to mobilize bricks and sand. So, they said they would see what they could do. We waited for over a year, but they didn't come back. Then, after two years, the digester bag collapsed. We tried to feed and get the bag back, but it didn't work out. Then, at some point, a calf that would have cost K200000 fell in the hole and broke a leg. So, we decided to take it out to protect the livestock. Therefore, we took the digester bag out and covered the hole - so that's where we are today. But, I can say we never used it. When we tried to cook nsima, but it would only simmer, and then it would stop producing gas."
34,2022-09-23,2, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came?," **Interviewee**: It was a lot of people. I remember they were coming in cars. They were coming often, but at some point, they stopped coming. And all that time the digester bag was full that you could stand on it without collapsing, but it wasn't just producing fire. So, we just abandoned it, and continued using firewood as you can see. Then, we bought a charcoal burner after seeing that it wasn\'t enough to use firewood only.... And as one of the person who was chosen to use benefit from the pilot project, I can say we need a different innovation, as biogas doesn't have the capacity to produce gas that people would use for cooking. And, when you go to the office tell the people there that biogas doesn't have capacity to work and meet people\`s needs So please bring a different innovation, for example, a solar system which we can use for lightning and cooking.... If you were there that time and saw how we worked, you could feel sorry for us that we wasted energy for nothing. We sourced a lot of water and 5 bags of fresh cow manure for one week from Chamtutu which wasn't easy, and people were even wondering what we were doing, and why we were getting manure from other people when we had our own cow house. So, it was a lot of manure that I couldn\`t even manage to get from my cow house for a week... So when you go back tell them that the people have removed the digesters, because it was a danger to livestock, and that they want a different solution, and not biogas."
34,2022-09-23,3, **Interviewer**: How many times did they come?," **Interviewee**: It's been many times. We have been receiving many visitors for a number of times. We've been receiving people from Lilongwe, Blantyre to check the digester together with our extension workers from Tengani EPA."
34,2022-09-23,4," **Interviewer**: You said you dug the hole, how many people dug the hole.", **Interviewee**: I dug the hole by myself.
34,2022-09-23,5," **Interviewer**: I can see that you have a few boys here, why did you dig the hole alone?", **Interviewee**: That time my boys were in school getting their diplomas.
34,2022-09-23,6, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to dig it?," **Interviewee**: It took me 2 days. So before digging they just gave me dimensions to work on. Then, l dug it according to instructions, and then we made feedstock and fed the bag. After a week or two, they came to install the digester. When they switched it on, it produced very little fire not enough to cook anything."
34,2022-09-23,7, **Interviewer**: How many people were involved in feedstock preparation?," **Interviewee**: It was my wife and I. I remember we had to move around the village to search for extra manure, as our manure was not enough. It took us time because it wasn't easy to gather one bag or so a day. And it's harder to gather one bag of fresh manure than dry manure. It seems simple but it's not. And I'm sure if the project implementers saw work we did they would have felt pity and given us money."
34,2022-09-23,8, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: They just said it was students from Chancellor College, who were trying out the digester to see if they would work. So, we thought their study was going to help us, but we were wrong as we didn't benefit anything."
34,2022-09-23,9, **Interviewer**: How were you selected as a beneficiary? What was the selection process?," **Interviewee**: The chiefs chose the people. They chose people who were hard working and active in community development projects. Every time there is a community project I'm always there, I never miss a session. For example, if there is an agricultural scheme activity which needs volunteers, I'm always there working on treadle pumps to get water for the crops. So, chiefs saw that and thought that I could manage the digester as well."
34,2022-09-23,10, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, not at all. I had never seen or heard about biogas before."
34,2022-09-23,11," **Interviewer**: Okay, so you say they chose you because of your hard work?"," **Interviewee**: yeah, five hard working people were chosen."
34,2022-09-23,12, **Interviewer**: And you can confirm that the other four beneficiaries are hard working as you?," **Interviewee**: Very much so. The man who has directed you \[name redacted\] here is a hard-working man. Even, Chief \[name redacted\] is a hard worker too. He's always pushing us in community development projects. He leads by example. So, we always work hand in hand with him. You can't have development in a community like this with a lazy chief, so our chief is a hard worker, and that's why he has good working relationship with extension workers and other community workers."
34,2022-09-23,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: We expected to use it for cooking and to give us some rest especially women in regards to searching firewood for cooking. So, we thought our women with the coming in of the digesters would not have a hard time sourcing and igniting fire especially after returning from the farms. So, we thought it was going to take away that burden from them. And, when it came my wife was on the forefront collecting manure, and she even told me that we shouldn't go to the farms for a week in order to concentrate on this. So, I was happy because I expected my wife to get rest in terms difficulties she faces in cooking. And when we were trying it, she was so happy to see the water boiling. I have never seen her so happy in a while. The neighbors came and saw it, and there were so happy too saying it was our time to rest. And, a lot of people came because it was a new thing and they wanted it in their houses too. But, we told them that if things go well for us, then they would have a chance to own one in the future. \[Goes away to chase goats eating maize\]"
34,2022-09-23,14, **Interviewer**: Troublesome goats!, **Interviewee**: I was also a beneficiary of the goats too.
34,2022-09-23,15, **Interviewer**: What did the installers say you should expect from this?," **Interviewee**: They said if things go well, then more people would get the digesters up to the point every household gets one, so that people should stop cutting trees for cooking."
34,2022-09-23,16," **Interviewer**: Oh, if the digester had worked, it could have been a very good thing for the community and the environment."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, very true."
34,2022-09-23,17, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: We did not receive training and that's why we found ourselves in a very difficult situation. I thought at the end of it, my wife and I, were going for training to learn about biogas and even get training allowance. I thought two of us were going for training, so that if one was not around the other one would manage it. Or, at least they could have just got my wife to training because she's the one who spends most of the time in the kitchen. But, they just gave us the digester without training, and we were very saddened by that. \[Stop to chase goats eating maize\]."
34,2022-09-23,18, **Interviewer**: So you didn't receive any training?, **Interviewee**: We didn't receive any training. Not even for a day. They just installed the digester and told us to do this and that.
34,2022-09-23,19, **Interviewer**: What was that?," **Interviewee**: They just taught us how to make feedstock. They also told us to feed the digester whenever the bag was deflating. They also told us how to make the hole. But, other than that they didn't teach us anything."
34,2022-09-23,20," **Interviewer**: I suppose they told you how to switch it on and off, like how to operate it."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they told us how to switch it on and off. Then, they told us that when we saw very little gas coming, we needed to feed it with a bag of manure to boost it up... That was it! \[Stop to chase goats\] ... We got these goats from DAPP to improve our livelihood. I got five goats; one buck and four nannys. The plan is that when they conceive I should give to other people who would also give to other people and so on."
34,2022-09-23,21," **Interviewer**: Oh, nice. So after all that talk, how prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were?"," **Interviewee**: I think, we would have managed to operate it, but the problem was that it didn\'t produce enough gas from the onset, so we didn't use it all. It didn't produce gas to help us in any way. So the problem was that they were supposed to line the hole a brick wall around it to make it work, but they didn't. Personally, it could have been better if they had just installed solar panels because it doesn't really depend on the sun as a digester does."
34,2022-09-23,22," **Interviewer**: When the chiefs chose you, you had the right to say no, but you didn't. Why did you accept to build the digester here?"," **Interviewee**: You don't say no to a project that's intended to develop the community. We felt very lucky to be chosen out of 200 or 300 people in the community. We thought God chose us, because there were so many people who could have got it. But, God favored us out of those people, so we couldn't have said no; if they chose us to go steal something, then we would have said no. If someone gives you work that you would be paid or benefit, you don't say no; so, what more to be given something beneficial for free. Thus, when we got it we were thankful to God and to the NGO because we struggle a lot in the rainy season, as charcoal is hard to find, let alone to dry wood."
34,2022-09-23,23, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: We use firewood and dry stems of certain plants from the fields, and it's what you are seeing there. It's very common here. The last couple of days we had no charcoal. We have bought charcoal yesterday. It's that bag there."
34,2022-09-23,24," **Interviewer**: Okay, before this came were you using charcoal as well?"," **Interviewee**: No, we were using firewood. It's only this year because of hunger. It has forced people of a certain village to sell charcoal here. They sell charcoal at K2500. So before they started bringing charcoal here we used to burn logs and use it as coal because it burns longer... Because of hunger, the people of Mpelembe have started making charcoal to sell here... But, they do it illegally and when forest officials catch them, they are sent to prison. So, they are only doing this because of hunger. There is famine there also because it's hard to find land for farming there. Even us, we don\`t have land to plant crops, so we don't plant maize here. We plant maize in Mozambique."
34,2022-09-23,25," **Interviewer**: Oh, you grow maize in Mozambique?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we grow maize in Mozambique. Of course, we also grow maize here, but it's a small portion because of shortage of land. So, we get our food from Mozambique."
34,2022-09-23,26, **Interviewer**: How many cows do you have?," **Interviewee**: Right now, I have 9 cows but that time I had more than 20 cows. I sold some because of financial problems, and also because I was paying for my children's education. My son you saw there was doing a diploma in electrical engineering, and my daughter is in secondary school. So, I value my children's education because I don't want them to be illiterate like me. So, I sell cows to pay fees for them and I don't feel like I'm losing. I also sold cows to pay fees for my other child who now working with Escom. So, you can see that I\`m keen in educating my children, and it has started bearing results."
34,2022-09-23,27, **Interviewer**: Oh nice. You are doing the right thing; education is the best investment a parent can make in their children. How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: Around this time of the year, we gather dry manure onto one place in the cow house. And then we burn the manure to repel mosquitoes and ticks, which are a nuisance to cows."
34,2022-09-23,28,How did you learn that?,It's common knowledge here. Everybody knows it here.
34,2022-09-23,29," **Interviewer**: Interesting! You said you used five bags of fresh cow manure to start it up, how much water did you use?", **Interviewee**: We used one drum (200L) of water.
34,2022-09-23,30, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: We got it from a borehole.
34,2022-09-23,31," **Interviewer**: Okay, you also mentioned that you used cow dung from your cows as well as cow dung from other people. How was it like to get dung from other people?"," **Interviewee**: Everything was okay. There was no problem. The people here are always happy when there is a community development project, so they always contribute towards its success in whatever way. Everywhere I went to ask for cow dung the people were forthcoming and they gave me cow manure as I wished."
34,2022-09-23,32," **Interviewer**: Some people have told me that it's not easy to go into someone's cow house because some cow owners use rituals that do not allow strangers to go in their cow houses, what's your take on this?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, but it depends on the reasons of going inside the cow house. If you are just going there to collect cow manure, there's no problem. You can enter. But, if you're going there to steal, then there's a problem and that's when rituals work and are for. For example, a girl who has begun puberty is not allowed to go in my cow house. A girl who is 11 or 12 years can't enter my cow house. And now with the change in life, some girls start puberty as early as 9 years, those I don't allow to go into my cow house. But, a girl who hasn't started puberty can enter into my cow house without any problem."
34,2022-09-23,33," **Interviewer**: Why? Or, what is the ritual for?"," **Interviewee**: ""Nothing!"" For example, if you can ask me to go there, I can allow you. But, if you could come to steal then you wouldn\`t see the cow house there, it will disappear and you might even get in serious trouble."
34,2022-09-23,34," **Interviewer**: So, maybe the ritual for you is that a girl who has started puberty shouldn't go in. Maybe for others the ritual is that a stranger should not enter their cow house..."," **Interviewee**: Ah, no. People do allow others to go in their cow houses. And the ritual works for thieves who come at night and it doesn't work for thieves who come in the day light. But that's fine, because thieves don't come in the day light."
34,2022-09-23,35," **Interviewer**: Okay, I see. How did it work after commission?"," **Interviewee**: On the day of commissioning, it worked for half an hour. First, we tried it with bathing water. Then, water boiled and I went to bath. Then, we put a pot of nsima, when I was bathing I heard that it had gone off (laughs). Then, we went to the digester bag and we found it full. But, after some time the bag started deflating."
34,2022-09-23,36, **Interviewer**: What happened the next day?," **Interviewee**: On the second day after coming from the fields, we did put a pot to heat side dish from the previous day and it heated up \[5 minutes\], here we do not throw away food, as you do in town, we keep for the next day, the side dish heated up. But, after we put a pot of nsima, it went off again. Then, when we went to the digester bag and poked it, the bag pitched, so we knew that there was no gas in it. After that, we decided to feed it with two buckets of cow manure. So after it was feed, it produced little gas and it went off. That was in November, and the bag continued to shrink back. It continued to shrink from December through April. In May, that's when the bag completely deflated, and there was no sign of air in the bag afterwards. Some people last year or previous year came to see it. They found the bag completely collapsed, and I told them that the digester had brought nothing but problems to me. So, they told me that they were going to bring new digesters, but up now I have never seen them again. Then, that's when a calf fell into the pit and broke its legs. So, I decided to simply take out the bag and cover the pit. It was so hard to get it out because it was full of manure. I remember 10 people failed to carry it, so we cut it to take out the contents."
34,2022-09-23,37," **Interviewer**: So from the time it was installed, you never cooked nsima. If you ever used it, it was only for boiling water for bathing, and heating side dish, just once as well."," **Interviewee**: Cooking nsima on it was a tall order -- that was impossible. It was like asking for a lot. It never happened! Things have not been good for me. It started with the digester. Then my other child has been in the hospital for 8 months now, and my child was involved in an accident some weeks back, so things have been tough for me."
34,2022-09-23,38, **Interviewer**: Oh sorry. I hope things will work out for you -- God be with you.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, thanks."
34,2022-09-23,39, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?, **Interviewee**: It was just cow dung and water.
34,2022-09-23,40, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you feed it and how often?," **Interviewee**: I was feeding it on Sunday. So, the feedstock was working from Monday to Saturday, and on Sunday, I was refilling it again."
34,2022-09-23,41, **Interviewer**: You were only feeding it on Sunday?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was only feeding it on Sunday."
34,2022-09-23,42, **Interviewer**: What were you feeding it and how often?," **Interviewee**: I was feeding it with one bucket of cow manure, thick as this."
34,2022-09-23,43, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add?," **Interviewee**: One bucket of 20 liters. Sometimes, after feeding it in the morning, we were also told to add water especially if it was too hot to help the reactor to breakdown the manure. When we did this, we could here certain loud sound in the bag."
34,2022-09-23,44, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: First, I was placing the manure in a bucket. Then, I was filling a bucket with water. After that, I was mixing manure and water with hands to break down the lumps. Then, I was using a stick to stir the mixture until it was smooth. After that, I was pouring the mixture in the digester where it was broken down by heat as well as water. I was breaking the lumps and then stir because if I did not do that then feedstock would not have passed through the inlet pipe and blocked it eventually."
34,2022-09-23,45," **Interviewer**: Okay, who was responsible for feeding it?"," **Interviewee**: I was doing everything, like I said my boys were not around l that time."
34,2022-09-23,46, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about feeding?," **Interviewee**: It wasn't in the problem. It was only intense on the first day when we were starting it..... But, we were not happy that we did not receive training. We only came to terms with that because it was free, a gift, so we could not have asked for more."
34,2022-09-23,47, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: It only needed to be fed with cow manure to function. Once it was fed, you just switch it on and off. If it was off, you needed to feed it, and it starts again, and so on. Secondly, we needed to prevent soil from collapsing into it pit. So, its maintenance is easy; it only needs to be fed and to ensure that the pit is protected from soil. It is only covered now because it has taken any long time without work. It has now been 5 years without working."
34,2022-09-23,48," **Interviewer**: Ok, I wanted us to talk about if it met your needs. Apparently, it did not meet your needs as you didn't use it...."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we had the desire to use it for cooking, but unfortunately, we did not. It only gave us a hard time. We wanted to use it for cooking nsima and side dish, but every time we did put a pot on the stove, it was going off. Then, my wife would go look for firewood to continue cooking. Then, we lost interesting after seeing the bag deflating, and it eventually collapse to the bottom."
34,2022-09-23,49, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: The first and main challenge is that it did not work. The second problem was that it was supposed to be lined with a brick wall as they said, but we failed to line it. A digester works well on sunny days and when the pit is lined to maintain the heat. It could have worked well, if it was lined. So because it wasn't lined there was warmth at the top bag and coldness at the bottom of the pit, so that why it did not work."
34,2022-09-23,50, **Interviewer**: Who told you that it was supposed to be lined?, **Interviewee**: It was the forth people who came.
34,2022-09-23,51, **Interviewer**: It wasn't the installers?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it wasn't the installers. The first people just told us to dig the hole; they did not talk about lining it."
34,2022-09-23,52,\[question inaudible\], **Interviewee**: I think fourth people were from MERA.
34,2022-09-23,53, **Interviewer**: You have said the problem started from the onset. I want to know was the fire starting and going off at once or gradually?, **Interviewee**: It was going off gradually.
34,2022-09-23,54, **Interviewer**: How long was it taking the gas to go stop?," **Interviewee**: It was taking a very short time to go off. It couldn't stay long as we have stayed here; So, it was taking less than 5 minutes"
34,2022-09-23,55, **Interviewer**: How long did it work before stopping completely?," **Interviewee**: In November after the rains started, that is when it stopped completely. There was no sign of life in November because it cold."
34,2022-09-23,56," **Interviewer**: And this one came in July or August... and all this time it was going on and off, and you never used it?", **Interviewee**: Yes
34,2022-09-23,57," **Interviewer**: After November, did you try to feed it?","Yes, but the digester bag was the deflating more and more. And it couldn't produce even a small flame of fire. It was only making a snapping sound when we tried to light it up. That time it was also releasing slurry at the digestate at the outlet as it was doing before, and it was very disgusting."
34,2022-09-23,58," **Interviewer**: Oh, it must have been disgusting."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but because you wanted it very bad, we did not care about that."
34,2022-09-23,59, **Interviewer**: How many times did you feed it after it stopped producing flames?," **Interviewee**: I fed it 3 times, I shouldn't lie. My wife was the one pushing me to feed it as she thought I was not putting enough manure. We tried very hard to feed it because we really wanted to use it for cooking one day."
34,2022-09-23,60, **Interviewer**: Did you call the project implementers?," **Interviewee**: I was not given their phone number. Maybe they gave the chiefs and extension workers, but as for me, I was not given."
34,2022-09-23,61, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this before?, **Interviewee**: No
34,2022-09-23,62, **Interviewer**: It is information regarding problems common with digesters and their related causes and solutions. What do you think about this information and do you think it could have helped in your case?," **Interviewee**: No, it could not have help because the digester never worked or produced fire at all. So this information would have helped if the digesters had worked. For example, when you have a bicycle and it breaks down, you get the spare parts and ask if you lack information to fix it. With the digester, everything was intact; it was only that it wasn\'t producing fire. That's why we tried to feed it with manure but then the bag was shrinking even more."
34,2022-09-23,63," **Interviewer**: Today is 22 September, if the installers call you today to ask how your digester is, what would you say? How would you describe the current state of your digester?"," **Interviewee**: First, I would tell them that it is not working. Second, I would tell them that we removed the digester bag and covered the hole because it was dangerous to livestock. And, I could tell them to tell their bosses to bring solar and not biogas again because biogas is a waste of time. It made us do a very hard job without benefit. So, it's better to bring solar because it's user friendly and also it can be used for lighting and cooking as well. Also, solar works even when there is rain unlike a biogas digester. So, if they call, I could tell them biogas is a burden, and it injured my calf. And, some people have cut the bag, but we have not. I only hired 15 people to carry it out of the pit. That thing is heavy."
34,2022-09-23,64, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay them?," **Interviewee**: That time I paid them K3000 for the job, but if it was now I would have paid K7000 or so."
34,2022-09-23,65," **Interviewer**: I can see that you have just left the digester there, and you are using the pipes as a clothesline. Where is the stove?", **Interviewee**: It's in the house. Let me go get it. This is it.
34,2022-09-23,66," **Interviewer**: Oh, you are a keeper."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we have everything."
34,2022-09-23,67," **Interviewer**: Truth talking, considering all that happened, why do you think it did not work? How did it reach this stage?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know exactly what went wrong. But it looks like, digesters can't work in cold season, so they can't work here in Malawi because we do have cold and rainy season. Secondly, cow manure loses its strength fast when it's in the bag. So, cow manure is not an effective or reliable source of energy \[feedstock\]. Thirdly, digesters can't just work without a brick wall lining. So in my opinion, I think solar system is better because it has no maintenance issues, and can be use for lighting. Of course, people will try to find ways to make biogas work or better, but whatever they may do it cannot just work in the cold season."
34,2022-09-23,68," **Interviewer**: Now that it's not working, how do you meet your energy needs? You mentioned firewood and charcoal, right?"," **Interviewee**: I'm using that charcoal bag. I bought it yesterday. There I'm boiling water, so that when my wife comes from the farm, she should bath and recuperate. I'll use that for cooking nsima, and by Sunday, it will be finished. I bought the bag at K2500, and in two weeks, I will use two bags. So, in a month I spent K10000."
34,2022-09-23,69," **Interviewer**: That's a lot. Do you still use cow manure as a repellent for mosquitoes and ticks as you mentioned. Or, what do you do with cow manure now?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we still do that. But, some remove out of the cow how because if we don't the cow house will be full of wet manure when it rains. As a result, cows will have troubles in sleeping and will stand the whole night that we feel pity."
34,2022-09-23,70, **Interviewer**: How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: They just gave me the digester and didn't tell me how much they spent on it. I would be happy if I can be enlightened now.
34,2022-09-23,71, **Interviewer**: (laughs) now it's K600000 or K800000. Some even go as far as a million.," **Interviewee**: Oh, they gave us lot money."
34,2022-09-23,72," **Interviewer**: Yeah, did you contribute anything in kind? I'm seeing that you used you energy, cow manure, what else?"," **Interviewee**: And maybe water. Plus, the money we spent on the people who took it out......I'm sure everywhere you have gone you haven't find one working, but maybe the bag still in the bag. I only took it out because of the calf incidence and I keep it safe so that when the installers when come they should find it. So I just keep it there, I don't need to put it in the house because no one can come to steal that; what can it be used for?"
34,2022-09-23,73," **Interviewer**: Yeah, what kind of special items that had to be imported from another country?"," **Interviewee**: I can't know. They just told me that they were students, so I don't know if they made it themselves."
34,2022-09-23,74," **Interviewer**: Looking back, can you say it saved you money or made you lose money?"," **Interviewee**: I was doing most of the work by myself so didn't spend a lot. But, at that time, I hired some people to get manure for me at Chamtutu, so I paid them K3000."
34,2022-09-23,75," **Interviewer**: You received a biogas in 2017, you had it here, you still have all the equipment. What is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: If you get a wife and see that the marriage is not working you divorce, and get a new wife, so I\`m going for a solar system now."
34,2022-09-23,76, **Interviewer**: (laughs) so your new wife should be solar?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) this one has failed. She was a bad wife! We tried to make things, but she didn't want marriage."
34,2022-09-23,77, **Interviewer**: (laughs) you tried to involve marriage counselors but nothing happen!," **Interviewee**: (laughs) we want any innovation and you can see that we are handworkers and we did put in a lot of effort to make it work, but it just didn't work. Even tried to feed it in the cold and rainy season, but the bag was deflating more and more. We struggled a lot!"
34,2022-09-23,78, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: I don't know in other areas. But, for people of this community, I can say it has no future. People were given the digesters here, but no one will tell us that he is still using it or he used it. If at least one or two people were able to use it, then you could say the rest were careless or not committed\... No one can say everyone who was given the digester was careless and not committed. It's just that this thing didn't work, and I doubt if it can work with the climate here Malawi."
34,2022-09-23,79," **Interviewer**: My last question is, but I think you have repeatedly answered it, if you could have designed your own waste or anything intervention what could you have chosen instead of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: If the solar panels are available, it's better to install solar for lighting and cooking. Then, I think that way people would benefit. But, we know that resources are difficulty to mobilize, so the students who came here need to go back to the drawing board and redesign the digesters. And, before handing over the digesters, they need to train us on its operation and maintenance so that at the end we would learn about it and get training allowance to buy few things... Thus, if they are bringing digesters they need to take us for training... And, the training should involve women, that's my opinion. They need to take the women because they are the ones who spent most of the time in the kitchen. Then, maybe we can learn from them after. So the training should prioritize women. I'm not favoring women, but I think everyone has his or her role, so I believe women can do this one effectively."
34,2022-09-23,80," **Interviewer**: That was my last question. In closing, do you have anything to say?"," **Interviewee**: Basically, it is what I have already said. First, we need a different solution not Biogas. We want solar. If resources are not available then they can come with biogas. But, it needs great technical changes so that it becomes usable."
34,2022-09-23,81, **Interviewer**: Thanks for the interview.,NA
35,2022-09-23,1, **Interviewer**: Where did this digester originate from?, **Interviewee**: I don't know who brought it. I think it was a nongovernmental organization.
35,2022-09-23,2, **Interviewer**: Do you know the name of the organization?, **Interviewee**: I have forgotten its name.
35,2022-09-23,3," **Interviewer**: Do you remember anything about them? For example, what they were wearing, their cars or anything?", **Interviewee**: They were not wearing something like a uniform or work suit. It was just ordinary people in casual attire.
35,2022-09-23,4," **Interviewer**: okay, how many people were coming?"," **Interviewee**: It was more 8 people. Sometimes they were coming 3 people; the 2 people were simple men, but the third gentleman looked like a boss and he was fond of speaking English though. He was also speaking Chinese."
35,2022-09-23,5, **Interviewer**: Chinese?, **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
35,2022-09-23,6, **Interviewer**: Whom was he speaking Chinese with?, **Interviewee**: He was just uttering Chinese words.
35,2022-09-23,7, **Interviewer**: Was he Malawian?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, no doubt. But, he seemed like he lived in China at some point."
35,2022-09-23,8," **Interviewer**: Okay, who funded it?"," **Interviewee**: I think it was an NGO. But, the people who were coming were just contractors. They said they were installing the digesters as a pilot project."
35,2022-09-23,9, **Interviewer**: Who built it?, **Interviewee**: We built it.
35,2022-09-23,10, **Interviewer**: How many were you?, **Interviewee**: We were 2; me and this person here.
35,2022-09-23,11,Were you paid?," **Interviewee**: No, the project implementers asked the beneficiaries to dig a hole, so we did. I think the hole was 3 meters deep. After that, we built a brick wall around it."
35,2022-09-23,12, **Interviewer**: Who did the masonry work?, **Interviewee**: It was two of us again.
35,2022-09-23,13, **Interviewer**: How many bricks and cement did you use?, **Interviewee**: The wall was double layered so it used many bricks. I think we used 2000 bricks.
35,2022-09-23,14, **Interviewer**: How many bags of cement?, **Interviewee**: It was 4 bags.
35,2022-09-23,15, **Interviewer**: How much was a bag of cement then?," **Interviewee**: I think the bag was K8000 then, because we spent K28000 on cement alone."
35,2022-09-23,16," **Interviewer**: Eh, you mean you used 4 bags? That's enough to build a house...."," **Interviewee**: No, it was double layered and we plastered (lined) the bottom of the hole too."
35,2022-09-23,17," **Interviewer**: Okay, I get it. Where did you get the bricks?", **Interviewee**: We bought the bricks.
35,2022-09-23,18, **Interviewer**: How much did you spend on bricks?, **Interviewee**: A brick was K30.
35,2022-09-23,19, **Interviewer**: When was it built?, **Interviewee**: I don't remember.
35,2022-09-23,20,Did they install your digested together with the other people?, **Interviewee**: Yes.
35,2022-09-23,21, **Interviewer**: Then it was in the 7^th^ month of 2017.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and we did all the work. The installers only came to install the digesters."
35,2022-09-23,22, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to build it?," **Interviewee**: It took us 2 days to dig the hole, and another 4 days to build a wall around it and plaster it too."
35,2022-09-23,23," **Interviewer**: So it took you 6 days. What was your role? You have said you dug the hole and plaster the hole, apart from this what else did you do?", **Interviewee**: We were also responsible for sourcing manure. We also hired women to collect water.
35,2022-09-23,24," **Interviewer**: How many were they? And, how much did you pay them?"," **Interviewee**: We hired 4 women to collect water during the time we were lining it. So, for 4 days we paid each one K2500. We also hired the same women to collect water when we were preparing the initial feedstock, and we paid each woman K5000."
35,2022-09-23,25, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the manure?, **Interviewee**: We got it from other people.
35,2022-09-23,26, **Interviewer**: Did you pay?, **Interviewee**: We paid K200 per wheelbarrow.
35,2022-09-23,27, **Interviewer**: How much manure and water did you use to start it up?," **Interviewee**: We used one drum of 200 liters, if not 2 drums of 200 liters of water."
35,2022-09-23,28, **Interviewer**: Manure?, **Interviewee**: I think it was 15 wheelbarrows of cow manure. It was a lot!
35,2022-09-23,29," **Interviewer**: We have a lot people in this community, so how were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: We were given because we are hard workers and we are reliable. When we are given a task, we do it with commitment and with excellence."
35,2022-09-23,30, **Interviewer**: Are you not bragging about yourself? Are you hard workers?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) Yeah, it is not easy for any ordinary man to collect and prepare feedstock."
35,2022-09-23,31, **Interviewer**: So people who were given the digesters were all hard workers?, **Interviewee**: Yes.
35,2022-09-23,32, **Interviewer**: Were you not given because you are a chief?," **Interviewee**: No - not because of that. They choose us because of the things I have talked about. We have also other chiefs in the community, which were not chosen, so it was not because of that."
35,2022-09-23,33, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, we did not know about biogas, and we were even surprised what it was."
35,2022-09-23,34," **Interviewer**: What surprised you? Or, why were you surprised?"," **Interviewee**: We wondered how cow manure could produce gas for cooking, and it was something that we had never heard of. We only knew of electric stoves, but not biogas. So, when they installed it we were very surprised to see fire."
35,2022-09-23,35, **Interviewer**: Did it work?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it worked. And we were even able to cook on it. But, its performance was dependent on the sun. When there was no sun, or cloudy the bag could not inflate and produce gas. But, when the sun was hot like this, the bag was getting completely full to the point that I could even stand on it and the bag could not shrunk."
35,2022-09-23,36," **Interviewer**: So, it was working when there was sunlight? When there was no sun, it could not work?", **Interviewee**: Right! So it was working from morning up to 4 PM.
35,2022-09-23,37," **Interviewer**: Okay, I hear that 10 beneficiaries were chosen from Tengani. How were you selected? What was the selection process?"," **Interviewee**: The people were called for a community meeting by chiefs, so at the meeting people were briefed about the project, and then people who were hardworking were chosen."
35,2022-09-23,38, **Interviewer**: So it was people who chose the beneficiaries and not chiefs?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was the people who chose the beneficiaries at a community meeting called by the chiefs."
35,2022-09-23,39," **Interviewer**: Oh, you must be really hardworking."," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) yes, we are."
35,2022-09-23,40, **Interviewer**: Did you attend the meeting?, **Interviewee**: Yes
35,2022-09-23,41, **Interviewer**: How many people were there?," **Interviewee**: The whole community was there, and that time the village had 700 people."
35,2022-09-23,42, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?, **Interviewee**: We were so happy because we expected to stop using firewood for cooking.... And we expected to stop damaging the environment as well.
35,2022-09-23,43, **Interviewer**: You do not like cooking firewood.," **Interviewee**: We feel happy because here we do not have electricity and it is very difficult to source money to buy charcoal. But, we liked biogas even more."
35,2022-09-23,44,Why?," **Interviewee**: It was easy to use. It did not require going around searching for wood, and it did not need put firewood constantly to maintain the fire... Once biogas ignited, everything was smooth."
35,2022-09-23,45, **Interviewer**: So you expected to cook with ease?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we expected to cook 3 times a day on it. However, it only worked late morning and in the early afternoon hours."
35,2022-09-23,46," **Interviewer**: Okay, what did the installers tell you to expect?"," **Interviewee**: After installation, they only told us that we would be using it for cooking. But they did not tell us the specific times we would be using it. They also told us to feed it every morning with 2 buckets of cow manure and 3 buckets of water."
35,2022-09-23,47, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: They only told us on how to use it. But, it wasn't like we went for a training or a seminar, everything was done on site."
35,2022-09-23,48, **Interviewer**: How were you supposed to use it?, **Interviewee**: Can I go get that? (Goes to get a stove)
35,2022-09-23,49," **Interviewer**: Yeah! Let me drink water, it is hot here"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, this was the stove. They told us that a pipe carrying gas from the digester is connected here. Then, if we wanted to cook, they told us to turn this clockwise, and when we turned it gas was coming on the stove. So, that was the training!"
35,2022-09-23,50, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you anything to do with maintenance?," **Interviewee**: No, they did not."
35,2022-09-23,51, **Interviewer**: How prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were?, **Interviewee**: We felt okay! And we used it with no issues.
35,2022-09-23,52," **Interviewer**: You said you were chosen at a community meeting by the people to be a beneficiary. When one is chosen, one is at liberty to accept or not to. Why did you accept it?"," **Interviewee**: We accepted it because you were chosen. When you are chosen by people, it is disrespectful to say no. Secondly, we liked the technology so we wanted to try it. Also, we thought we were lucky to have it, so we could not let luck go by."
35,2022-09-23,53, **Interviewer**: So you wanted to do try it and it was your luck?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
35,2022-09-23,54," **Interviewer**: Was it really a blessing or a curse? I mean sometimes things look good on the outside, but when you have them, it is the complete opposite. Were you lucky?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) yes, indeed, I think we were lucky to have it."
35,2022-09-23,55, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: We used firewood.
35,2022-09-23,56, **Interviewer**: Where did you get wood?, **Interviewee**: We source firewood from the bushes.
35,2022-09-23,57, **Interviewer**: Daily?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, daily."
35,2022-09-23,58, **Interviewer**: Was it not a tough job?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it is."
35,2022-09-23,59, **Interviewer**: Did you use charcoal that time?," **Interviewee**: No, it is only recent that we started using charcoal. Back then, before it stopped working, we used firewood only."
35,2022-09-23,60," **Interviewer**: What has changed now? I mean you have said before it came you were using only firewood, but now you are using both. What has changed basically?"," **Interviewee**: It is so hard to find firewood now, so we decided to buy a charcoal burner with the little money we had to lessen the burden. So, when we do not have money, we go source firewood in the bushes."
35,2022-09-23,61, **Interviewer**: How many bags of charcoal do you use in a month?, **Interviewee**: We use 3 bags.
35,2022-09-23,62, **Interviewer**: How much is a bag of charcoal?, **Interviewee**: It is K3000
35,2022-09-23,63," **Interviewer**: That's expensive. In some areas, a bag of charcoal is K2500."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, if you go that far side it is K2500, but on this side is K3000."
35,2022-09-23,64, **Interviewer**: Some people say they prefer chips cooked on firewood because it tastes somewhat different from chips cooked on charcoal. Did you differentiate the food cooked on biogas from the one cooked on charcoal or firewood in terms of taste?," **Interviewee**: Not really, but the difference has to be there since food cooked on biogas is smoke free. The one thing with cooking on firewood or charcoal is that it's easy to burn or over cook food because you do not necessarily regulate the intensity of the fire like biogas. Also, you need to be around every time when you are cooking with firewood to maintain the fire by adding firewood."
35,2022-09-23,65," **Interviewer**: Did you have cattle that time? Or, you were just asking for manure from other people?"," **Interviewee**: We asked when there was a deficit, for example, on the day we started it up. But, we also had our own cows."
35,2022-09-23,66, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: We were just throwing it away.
35,2022-09-23,67, **Interviewer**: What about using it in the farm?," **Interviewee**: Soil is fertile here, so if you apply manure you kill the crops. I think manure contains nutrients that are not suitable for this soil\... I believe soil is so fertile here that additional nutrient from manure makes the nutrients in the soil to surpass its required level thereby it kills the crops."
35,2022-09-23,68, **Interviewer**: So you don\'t apply of any type?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
35,2022-09-23,69, **Interviewer**: How does the maize perform?," **Interviewee**: It does quite good. I think it does better than maize applied with manure or fertilizer. So, if the rains are okay that year, then we do have a bumper yield."
35,2022-09-23,70," **Interviewer**: Everybody in Blantyre, Thyolo and else applies fertilizer, so why do think your soil is fertile here? Why is it different from the soil in Blantyre or Lilongwe? What makes your soil fertile?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, I do not know why."
35,2022-09-23,71," **Interviewer**: Moving on, let us talk about how you started it. You said you started it up with 15 buckets of cow new and the one drum (200 liters), if not two drums (400 liters) of water. How long did it take to start up?", **Interviewee**: I have forgotten.
35,2022-09-23,72," **Interviewer**: So from the day you fed it with huge amounts of cow manure and water, how long did it take you to start using it?"," **Interviewee**: Mmh, if I say I remember, I will lie."
35,2022-09-23,73, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: It was working okay, and sometimes it wasn't. When there was sunlight, we could cook a little bit."
35,2022-09-23,74," **Interviewer**: When there was sun, how much cooking time did you get?"," **Interviewee**: I remember one day I cooked beans in the morning, and at lunch, I also cooked nsima."
35,2022-09-23,75, **Interviewer**: That's like 2 or 3hours of cooking time., **Interviewee**: Yeah
35,2022-09-23,76, **Interviewer**: How much cooking time did you get when there was no sun?, **Interviewee**: The bag was deflating.
35,2022-09-23,77," **Interviewer**: So, you mean you could not cook when there was sun?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we couldn't cook."
35,2022-09-23,78, **Interviewer**: You couldn't cook nsima?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it was not producing fire. When there was no sun and we turned it on, it was producing a hissing sound, but gas couldn't be light up."
35,2022-09-23,79, **Interviewer**: So you were getting this sound whenever there was no sun?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, yeah. It was like this when we had clouds, or during sunset."
35,2022-09-23,80, **Interviewer**: How did you use gas?, **Interviewee**: It was for cooking only.
35,2022-09-23,81, **Interviewer**: How many people used the gas?, **Interviewee**: We were 7 people that time.
35,2022-09-23,82," **Interviewer**: I want to be clear on how it worked after commission. You said it worked depending on the sun, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
35,2022-09-23,83, **Interviewer**: Were you able to make tea and lunch when it was sunny?," **Interviewee**: We would make tea (boil water) and cook nsima at lunch, or sometimes dish side of vegetables."
35,2022-09-23,84, **Interviewer**: Evening?," **Interviewee**: No, it wasn't producing gas."
35,2022-09-23,85," **Interviewer**: Okay, that's like 45 minutes to 1 hour and some minutes of cooking time a day. When there was no sun, did you manage to make tea?", **Interviewee**: No.
35,2022-09-23,86, **Interviewer**: So it was heavily dependent on the sun..., **Interviewee**: Yeah
35,2022-09-23,87," **Interviewer**: So after all this, did you consult the installers or the project implementers?", **Interviewee**: I'm not sure on that. I believe my father would know.
35,2022-09-23,88, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?, **Interviewee**: It only needed to be fed with cow manure and water.
35,2022-09-23,89, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We used to pour manure in a bucket and add water, and then stirred the feedstock. After that, we poured the feedstock into the digester."
35,2022-09-23,90, **Interviewer**: What did you use for stirring the feedstock?, **Interviewee**: We used a stick.
35,2022-09-23,91, **Interviewer**: Were you soaking cow manure to be used the following day?," **Interviewee**: No, they told us to use fresh manure so everything was done on the day."
35,2022-09-23,92," **Interviewer**: Cow manure contains trash, how did you hand it?"," **Interviewee**: We were simply removing the trash from the feedstock with hands, so no trash was going in the digester."
35,2022-09-23,93," **Interviewer**: How often did you feed you digester, and in what quantities?", **Interviewee**: We were feeding it daily with 2 wheelbarrows of cow manure and 3 buckets of water each of 20L capacity.
35,2022-09-23,94, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: From the borehole.
35,2022-09-23,95, **Interviewer**: How far?," **Interviewee**: It wasn't far, maybe 300 -- 400 meters."
35,2022-09-23,96, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: It was I.
35,2022-09-23,97, **Interviewer**: Who else was supporting?, **Interviewee**: It was only me.
35,2022-09-23,98," **Interviewer**: You said you were 7 people, why were you the only person responsible for feeding?", **Interviewee**: The others were school going children.
35,2022-09-23,99, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about the work of feeding?," **Interviewee**: It was hard work because I was doing it every day. And before mixing feedstock, I had to source manure and water, so was tough. I think it's tougher than sourcing wood."
35,2022-09-23,100, **Interviewer**: Oh! So you think it's better to go search for firewood than prepare feedstock?," **Interviewee**: Considering the way the digester worked, it was better to source firewood than make feedstock... But, if everything worked okay, biogas was better because it's easy to use. What put me off is the work of feed it; it was intense."
35,2022-09-23,101, **Interviewer**: Then why didn't you just abandon it and continue using firewood?," **Interviewee**: No, the digester was given to us as a gift. So, if we stopped doing the hard work of feeding the digester, it would have broken down."
35,2022-09-23,102," **Interviewer**: Let's suppose it wasn\'t given to you as a gift, would you choose to feed a digester or search for fire!", **Interviewee**: I would choose biogas.
35,2022-09-23,103, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: It's fast.
35,2022-09-23,104," **Interviewer**: But, because it didn't work as you thought, you think it's was better to go search for firewood?", **Interviewee**: Right!
35,2022-09-23,105, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: I don't remember anything regarding maintenance. Maybe, my father knows. But, I don't remember anything concerning that... I think they gave us number though."
35,2022-09-23,106, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for its maintenance?," **Interviewee**: I remember one time gas connector disconnected from the bag, so the digester bag collapsed, as there was no gas in it. So, we got a tire rubber and sealed it. It only worked for a month."
35,2022-09-23,107, **Interviewer**: How long did it take for this problem happened?, **Interviewee**: I can't remember.
35,2022-09-23,108, **Interviewer**: Did it meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: No, it didn't. Like I said, we expected to use it in the morning, afternoon and evening, but we couldn't. So, we were still using firewood for cooking."
35,2022-09-23,109, **Interviewer**: What challenges did you encounter?," **Interviewee**: It was difficult to source manure as we had small number of cattle. We had 7cattle that time so it was hard to get gather 2 wheelbarrows of fresh manure. Thus, sometimes we had to go ask from other people. Some people would refuse to give us manure."
35,2022-09-23,110, **Interviewer**: Why would they refuse to give you manure?, **Interviewee**: Some people use back magic. So the ritual is that no person should enter the animal house expect themselves. Some were selling us: some were giving us for free.
35,2022-09-23,111, **Interviewer**: (laughs) do people really do that? I hear it's common to do black magic with cows?, **Interviewee**: (Laughs) people do that; some people who own cows can't let you in their cow house because of rituals.
35,2022-09-23,112, **Interviewer**: (laughs) why is that?, **Interviewee**: It is part of protection that no thief should steal cows. Some do it to be successful in the cow farming.
35,2022-09-23,113," **Interviewer**: (Laughs) so the main challenges I have notes are; it was hard to find feedstock as some people would not give you; it was not working as you wanted; and you had issues with the gas connector. Apart from these, what other challenges did you face?", **Interviewee**: That's was all.
35,2022-09-23,114," **Interviewer**: So in regards to malfunction, what other problems did you face on top of the gas connector issue?", **Interviewee**: That's was the only problem.
35,2022-09-23,115, **Interviewer**: How did this problem manifest?," **Interviewee**: When there was the sun, it was leaking gas that we could not have gas at the stove."
35,2022-09-23,116," **Interviewer**: So did it make a sound? Or, did you smell gas?", **Interviewee**: It was both.
35,2022-09-23,117," **Interviewer**: So you don't how long this problem took to manifest. I know you can't know the exact time, but did it take a month or months, roughly?"," **Interviewee**: It started small, but we didn't know what it was, and what to do with it. Then, the leak started producing water. So, we were surprised like where is the water coming from. Then we asked one another if someone had poured water on it, but no one accepted. Then, the water stopped coming out, and gas started to leak and the smell was coming out as well. Then, we tried to seal it, but after a month, it happened again."
35,2022-09-23,118, **Interviewer**: Did you try to fix it again?," **Interviewee**: No, My father and I left for a tombstone unveiling ceremony at Marka. We stayed away from a month. We came around the rainy season, so we didn't do anything, as we were busy with farming activities. And, we knew that we could not get gas even after fixing it since it was the rainy season and the sun was not coming out. Then, we just abandoned it."
35,2022-09-23,119, **Interviewer**: How long did you use it before it stopped working?," **Interviewee**: I think 3 months, if not 2 months."
35,2022-09-23,120," **Interviewer**: So after 3 months it stopped completely. Before that, how was it like?"," **Interviewee**: It was on and off.; sometimes it was not working because it had a fault, but because it wasn't feed. So, if we didn't feed it in the morning, it couldn't produce fire. If we fed it, it would produce fire."
35,2022-09-23,121, **Interviewer**: What caused your not to feed it sometimes to the extent of not getting fire at all?," **Interviewee**: When I was away, no one could feed it."
35,2022-09-23,122, **Interviewer**: So it couldn't be fed without you?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
35,2022-09-23,123, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: My parents preferred to use firewood because they thought it was involving to feed it.
35,2022-09-23,124, **Interviewer**: Did you ever call the installers or project implementers after any kind of fault?," **Interviewee**: I don't have that information, but my father does."
35,2022-09-23,125," **Interviewer**: After installation, how many other times did you see them?"," **Interviewee**: No, after installation they never came."
35,2022-09-23,126, **Interviewer**: No even once?," **Interviewee**: Let me see... Oh, they came one week after installation. After that, they never came back again."
35,2022-09-23,127, **Interviewer**: To give you papers?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they gave us papers, you are right."
35,2022-09-23,128," **Interviewer**: Did you tell them that you had problems with it i.e. you couldn't cook when there was no sun? If yes, what did they say?", **Interviewee**: I don't know because they didn't talk with me but my father.
35,2022-09-23,129, **Interviewer**: Do you have your father's phone? The one I got wasn't working.," **Interviewee**: yeah, he changed his number."
35,2022-09-23,130, **Interviewer**: Share me his number so that we can talk on some of the questions. Have you seen something like this before?, **Interviewee**: No
35,2022-09-23,131, **Interviewer**: What do you think of this information and do you think it would have helped in your case?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it could have helped."
35,2022-09-23,132, **Interviewer**: How?," **Interviewee**: Whenever we had a problem, we could have been consulting it and act accordingly."
35,2022-09-23,133, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of your digester today?," **Interviewee**: We have it, but it's not working?"
35,2022-09-23,134, **Interviewer**: You have the equipment?," **Interviewee**: Ah, no, some pipes dry in the ground as you saw. Also, some people moved the pipes as was built on a path."
35,2022-09-23,135, **Interviewer**: But the bag is still there?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
35,2022-09-23,136, **Interviewer**: I also saw the wall you built around it is intact., **Interviewee**: Yeah
35,2022-09-23,137," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, do you think it can work again?"," **Interviewee**: I think if the installers come and rehabilitate it, then it would work again because I think the bag is intact."
35,2022-09-23,138," **Interviewer**: Taking all think I to consideration, how did it reach this stage?", **Interviewee**: The main issue was the gas connector. It is what is today because of the gas connector.
35,2022-09-23,139," **Interviewer**: So, you think if the gas connector was strong and durable I could have seen it working today?"," **Interviewee**: If the gas connector and the pipes were more durable, you could have seen it today."
35,2022-09-23,140," **Interviewer**: Let suppose the pipes and the gas connector was okay, would you have kept on feeding it regardless of the fact you were cooking on it once a day on a good day?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we could have."
35,2022-09-23,141, **Interviewer**: How do you meet your energy needs now that it's not working?, **Interviewee**: We use firewood and charcoal. We buy charcoal on the side.
35,2022-09-23,142," **Interviewer**: But, you don't buy firewood?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
35,2022-09-23,143," **Interviewer**: I understand there are forest officials, how do you cope?"," **Interviewee**: The forest department gave us neem seeds, so we planted them. As a result, we have our own neem trees."
35,2022-09-23,144, **Interviewer**: Where is it now?, **Interviewee**: We have a woodlot. And some of the tree we planted for personal use are there.
35,2022-09-23,145, **Interviewer**: Was everyone given the seeds?," **Interviewee**: Everyone was given in this village, and that's why we have so many trees in this community. They gave us neem trees because it's an easy tree to plant. But, it's been a very long time. So, some people don't have it no more."
35,2022-09-23,146," **Interviewer**: Okay, how much did it cost?"," **Interviewee**: No, I don't know."
35,2022-09-23,147," **Interviewer**: But, whatever money was paid an NGO was responsible, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
35,2022-09-23,148," **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind? We have seen bricks, cement uh", **Interviewee**: Cow manure and water.
35,2022-09-23,149," **Interviewer**: You said you dug the hole with someone, like you were two?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
35,2022-09-23,150, **Interviewer**: Does this other person belong to this family?," **Interviewee**: No, he was a hired worker."
35,2022-09-23,151, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay him?, **Interviewee**: K40000
35,2022-09-23,152, **Interviewer**: Was that not too much in 2017?, **Interviewee**: The soil was very dry and compact.
35,2022-09-23,153, **Interviewer**: Who built the wall around it?, **Interviewee**: I built it. The hired worker supported me by simply handing me the mortar.
35,2022-09-23,154, **Interviewer**: So the K40000 was for digging the hole and supporting you in handling the mortar?, **Interviewee**: That was a different item. We paid him K5000 for that.
35,2022-09-23,155," **Interviewer**: So, he got how much in total?", **Interviewee**: He got K45000.
35,2022-09-23,156, **Interviewer**: Apart from this what other work was done?," **Interviewee**: No, all the hard work was done on the first day, for example, sourcing manure and water, and making the feedstock as well as digging the hole"
35,2022-09-23,157, **Interviewer**: What kind of special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I think they told us the digester bag came from China. They didn't tell us about the white PVC pipes for the inlet and outlet though."
35,2022-09-23,158," **Interviewer**: When are going towards the end. Ah, a digester releases digestate at the outlet pipe, how was the digestate collection point like?"," **Interviewee**: We dug a big hole and plastered it with cement, so the digestate was failing into the hole."
35,2022-09-23,159, **Interviewer**: What were you doing with the digestate?, **Interviewee**: We used to take it to our vegetable garden as manure.
35,2022-09-23,160, **Interviewer**: You have told me you don't apply manure to your maize...," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we don't."
35,2022-09-23,161," **Interviewer**: But, you do apply to vegetables"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we do apply to vegetables, tomato, but not maize"
35,2022-09-23,162, **Interviewer**: Did you save money when you were using it?, **Interviewee**: Yes
35,2022-09-23,163, **Interviewer**: How? I thought you don't buy firewood?," **Interviewee**: Sometimes we do buy firewood when we feel like our trees need to regenerate. And, we don't go to the mountains, so we buy sometimes. But, this doesn't happen regularly; it\`s very rare."
35,2022-09-23,164, **Interviewer**: Okay! What was the biggest change in your life that you had when you had the digester?, **Interviewee**: It minimized the cutting down of branches from our trees.
35,2022-09-23,165, **Interviewer**: We are remaining with 3 questions. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is good because it's easy to use. And, it was very handy especially after coming from the farm, as we didn't need to search for firewood and it was also fast since fire was coming upon ignition."
35,2022-09-23,166, **Interviewer**: Its drawbacks?," **Interviewee**: The gas connector needs adequate care, as it doesn't last long. Also, the pipes need proper handling."
35,2022-09-23,167," **Interviewer**: When you saw the pipes, do you think you can find the in the local market?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know if they can be found. But, I have never seen them anywhere else. My first time to see them was when they brought the digester."
35,2022-09-23,168, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas?," **Interviewee**: It's hard to answer that because our experience with this digester was very short, so it's hard to say. But I can say it's good because it's fast. In regards to people adopting it, I would say it's highly unlike because most of the people who were coming to see us using it said they couldn't manage."
35,2022-09-23,169, **Interviewer**: What were they saying?, **Interviewee**: It was involving. The work we were doing was hard to many. I also feel the same way though. I think it can be adoptable if it can be feed once a week or once every month.
35,2022-09-23,170," **Interviewer**: Last question. If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead of biogas?", **Interviewee**: I would be willing to work with any other intervention.
35,2022-09-23,171, **Interviewer**: What intervention?, **Interviewee**: Any intervention?
35,2022-09-23,172," **Interviewer**: (laughs) someone will bring a bomb, any you will accept it because you think it's an intervention. Okay, thanks. Do you have any last words before we end the interview?"," **Interviewee**: Mine is a concern. I think for biogas to be adopted it needs to be fed once a week or once a month, and not daily. If biogas is like that, I don't think it can work, because I feel it was a burden for us to concentrate on farming activities and feed it as well. So, it needs some modification to be adoptable."
35,2022-09-23,173," **Interviewer**: Okay, thanks for the interview.",NA
36,2022-09-23,1,"First question, where did this digester originate from?", **Interviewee**: I have forgotten. It's been a very long time.
36,2022-09-23,2," **Interviewer**: Yes indeed, 2017 is far."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I have forgotten."
36,2022-09-23,3, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came?," **Interviewee**: It was mostly two people. They were parking their car there, and would go to the place where the digester was installed, and then tell us one or two things."
36,2022-09-23,4," **Interviewer**: So, it was two people?"," **Interviewee**: It was a mostly two people; sometimes, they would come three people."
36,2022-09-23,5," **Interviewer**: Do you remember what they told you, or what they were telling you?"," **Interviewee**: I remember they told us to dig a hole, and then they gave us the dimensions for the hole. They also told us how to make feedstock to start up the digester. After feeding the digester, the bag got full. Then, after some days, they came and I recall they asked us to switch on the stove after they showed us how to. Afterwards, they took pictures, videos, and left."
36,2022-09-23,6," **Interviewer**: This was 2017, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that was 2017. But, after sometime, some people came and they asked us questions regarding its functionality. We told them that biogas is good, but our digester was going off whenever the sun disappeared. Sometimes, it was happening whilst cooking, so we had to start fire again on firewood. Then, they said they were going to come with solar panels to supplement biogas. Then, they got in their cars and picked papers for us to sign. So, we signed and since then they have never come back."
36,2022-09-23,7, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to build?," **Interviewee**: It took about a month for everything to be done, from the first came to the day we started it. The first week, we dug the hole. After that, we sourced fresh cow manure and made the feedstock. I have to tell you, mister, it was a heavywork (laughs) - to feed the bag with manure was not easy at all."
36,2022-09-23,8," **Interviewer**: Oh, I can imagine. Let's start with digging. How many people from your side took part in the building process?"," **Interviewee**: It was two people, my husband and one hired worker."
36,2022-09-23,9, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay him?, **Interviewee**: He charged us K3000.
36,2022-09-23,10, **Interviewer**: Who collected water?, **Interviewee**: I did that myself with the help of my three kids.
36,2022-09-23,11, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the cow manure?," **Interviewee**: We got it from the cow house of our chief; when we went there, he showed us fresh manure in the cow house, and we got it."
36,2022-09-23,12," **Interviewer**: Oh, he didn't say no?"," **Interviewee**: No, they knew that we wanted to use the manure for biogas, so there wasn't any problem. So, when we got it we made feedstock for the digester."
36,2022-09-23,13, **Interviewer**: How much manure did you get?," **Interviewee**: We got 6 or 10 bags of cow manure, if I have forgotten. To this, we added 12 buckets (20 liters) of water separately from the ones we added to the cow manure for mixing."
36,2022-09-23,14, **Interviewer**: How were you selected as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: Biogas needs hard working people, so the chiefs and community development committee saw that we are hard workers, and chose us - I just think so. A person who is not hard working or committed cannot manage it. It's involving. It's not easy to handle fresh manure daily. So, I accepted it, because the project was to develop the community. I liked it also because it presented us an opportunity of cooking without firewood. We simply switched it on whenever we wanted to cook. It was very easy and fast to use. And, many people were coming to appreciate the digester .So we were simply telling them to come at lunch when the sun was brightest, and make a cooking exhibition. It was good and the people liked it."
36,2022-09-23,15, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: Not at all. We learned about this when the senior chief communicated to the people that an organization was coming to install digesters to certain individuals, and that we were beneficiaries. So, we accepted it."
36,2022-09-23,16,What procedures or steps did the chief take to select the beneficiaries?," **Interviewee**: The chiefs called us for a community meeting and briefed as about the project. The communication at the meeting was that running a digester is very involving, so hard working and committed people would be chosen. So, people were choosing amongst themselves who they thought would manage it. Then, they would ask the chosen person, if he or she was willing to accept."
36,2022-09-23,17, **Interviewer**: How did people react? Didn\`t people feel jealousy and bitter after not being selected?," **Interviewee**: No, it was fine."
36,2022-09-23,18," **Interviewer**: Okay. You had the right to accept it, why did you accept to build it here?"," **Interviewee**: The people here did not know about it, so they explained that it is used for cooking, and you don't need firewood when you have it. They also explained that it helps people to save money especially those that buy charcoal. Then, they told us that we would learn more from the project implementers when they came."
36,2022-09-23,19, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: I expected it to last longer. I thought I could be using it today. And, if it had worked longer, many people would have adopted it here. We liked it because it was fast cook on, and it prevented people from searching for firewood. So, it gave us rest and peace, and we liked it a lot. It was good. And, again, I'm sure, if the project implementers worked with us to the point where we could run it on our own, many people would have adopted and valued it."
36,2022-09-23,20, **Interviewer**: You mentioned that at the community meeting you were told by the community leaders that you would learn more from the project implementers. What did they tell you? What did they tell you to expect from this?," **Interviewee**: They told us a lot. First, they told us that we would use it for cooking. They also went on to say that, it's like electricity so we would use it as a source of energy for our TVs. and charging phone batteries. It was a lot."
36,2022-09-23,21, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?, **Interviewee**: We didn't have any training.
36,2022-09-23,22," **Interviewer**: If you didn't receive training, then how were you able to switch it on and off?"," **Interviewee**: It wasn't training, but when they came, they just told us instructions. For example, they showed us a button for switching it on and off. They also told us how to make feedstock. So if there was training, maybe I have forgotten it."
36,2022-09-23,23," **Interviewer**: No, you haven't forgotten. That was it. How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?", **Interviewee**: I use firewood.
36,2022-09-23,24, **Interviewer**: Where do you get firewood?, **Interviewee**: We get it from a very far place.
36,2022-09-23,25,"How far? I mean, if you leave at 6:00 in the morning, what time do you return?",We return around this time.
36,2022-09-23,26, **Interviewer**: Around 2 PM?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's very far. We pass the houses you see there, and get to the mountains. That's far."
36,2022-09-23,27, **Interviewer**: How often do go there?," **Interviewee**: Maybe in a week we go there once because it's far. And, when go there our legs hurt. We don't go there sick or when we don\`t have the strength, because going there you are okay could be disastrous. So, when we are not ready for it, we just look for small pieces of wood around. But, we are forced to go there, when we need good firewood."
36,2022-09-23,28, **Interviewer**: Are there forest officials there?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but it's not as if we go into the mountain to cut trees. We just go there to pick dry wood or we get firewood around the mountain."
36,2022-09-23,29, **Interviewer**: Do you use charcoal?," **Interviewee**: To use charcoal it means you have money. We are poor, so we don't use charcoal."
36,2022-09-23,30, **Interviewer**: Do you differentiate cooking on biogas from using firewood?," **Interviewee**: In terms of taste, there is no difference. But, when you cook on the firewood, we sweat a lot because of the flames. While when we cooked on biogas, we didn't sweat because flames are concentrated on the pot. Another thing is that, biogas doesn't produce smoke; it's clean. So, after cooking on biogas a person doesn't smell or the clothes don't smell smoke-like."
36,2022-09-23,31, **Interviewer**: Were you using cow manure from your cows or you were getting manure from other people for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: We had our cows, but it wasn't enough. So, we were getting cow manure from other people too."
36,2022-09-23,32, **Interviewer**: How many cows did you have that time?, **Interviewee**: I had five cows.
36,2022-09-23,33, **Interviewer**: Do you still have them? I haven't seen any.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they have gone out for grazing."
36,2022-09-23,34, **Interviewer**: How did you manage you feedstock before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: We were just waiting for the manure to dry, and then take it to the farm."
36,2022-09-23,35," **Interviewer**: Okay, some people have told me that they don't use manure"," **Interviewee**: Maybe, on that side of Tengani, but here we apply manure as fertilizer. Even agriculture workers advise us to use it. They also educate us how to make fertilizer from manure. We make fertilizer in two ways. First, we bury it a pit and cover it. Or, we just pile the manure and turn it regularly for some time, and then take it to the farm. It's only people who are lazy that don't use manure. Of course, the soil is good, but it still needs additional fertilizer."
36,2022-09-23,36, **Interviewer**: You said that to start it you used six bags of cow manure and more than 12 buckets. How long did it take to start up after feeding it?," **Interviewee**: It didn't take long to start up. After feeding the bag, it got full, and they told us that it was enough to start it up. Then, they assembled the pipes and stoves, and told us to switch on and it worked."
36,2022-09-23,37, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to produce fire from the period you fed it with the initial feedstock?," **Interviewee**: The whole thing took a month from feeding it to starting up. And throughout this time, we were communicating and updating them as we had their numbers, and when we finished we called them and they came."
36,2022-09-23,38," **Interviewer**: So, that's like you waited for 2 weeks or so, since it took you a week or so to dig and make the initial feedstock. How did you use gas?", **Interviewee**: I used it for cooking one.
36,2022-09-23,39, **Interviewer**: Where did you get water?, **Interviewee**: We got it from the borehole.
36,2022-09-23,40, **Interviewer**: How far is it?, **Interviewee**: It's far.
36,2022-09-23,41, **Interviewer**: Like how far?, **Interviewee**: One is close to the chief's house. That's the closest.
36,2022-09-23,42, **Interviewer**: That's like 500 - 700 meters. How many people stay here?, **Interviewee**: 6 people.
36,2022-09-23,43, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?, **Interviewee**: The digester only needed feedstock of cow manure and water.
36,2022-09-23,44, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: First in the morning, we used to go and collect fresh cow manure from the cow house. Then, we placed manure in a bucket and filled it up with water, and then mix until the slurry was smooth. After that, we used to pour it in the digester."
36,2022-09-23,45," **Interviewer**: Nice, how did you mix it?"," **Interviewee**: We used bare hands to collect, crush manure lumps and mix the feedstock. Then, we would use a stick to mix it further. But, most of the time we used hands because you can't collect fresh manure without hands, so we proceeded with hands as well."
36,2022-09-23,46, **Interviewer**: Did you feel disgusted or unhealthy?," **Interviewee**: Not at all. We were simply collecting manure; add water, and then mix, done! Take another set, put it in a bucket and add water, and then mix. Done! So on and so on. (In the background) \[A six to ten years girl said she helped in feeding\]"
36,2022-09-23,47, **Interviewer**: I heard this one saying she helped preparing feedstock. Were the kids doing that too?, **Interviewee**: Yeah! They know how to make feedstock.
36,2022-09-23,48," **Interviewer**: Oh, they wanted it bad. How often did you feed it and in what quantity?", **Interviewee**: If we wanted to boost it up we used to feed it with 2 buckets of cow manure and water. We used to skip a day to feed it again.
36,2022-09-23,49," **Interviewer**: So the 2 buckets was ready prepared feedstock, not just cow manure?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that was after mixing cow manure with water. We used to see the thickness of slurry before stopping adding water to the manure."
36,2022-09-23,50, **Interviewer**: What was your feedstock like?, **Interviewee**: We didn't make it too watery; it was a little bit thick.
36,2022-09-23,51, **Interviewer**: Did they give you the ratio of the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: No, we were simply looking at the thickness of the feedstock. And, after the thickness was good, we fed it in the digester."
36,2022-09-23,52, **Interviewer**: Some people soak the manure the day before feeding the digester. Were you doing that?," **Interviewee**: I can only imagine a person using dry manure to do that. As for us, we used fresh cow manure throughout, so there was no need to soak it."
36,2022-09-23,53, **Interviewer**: So you never fed it with dry manure or do any pre-treatment?," **Interviewee**: They told us to use fresh manure all the times, so everything was done on the spot and no pre-treatment was required."
36,2022-09-23,54, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about feeding it?," **Interviewee**: It was a tough job especially the day we made feedstock to start it up. On the other days, I collected manure together with the children and my husband was preparing the feedstock itself, so it was not that tough. After, we fed it, the digester bag was getting full and it worked fine. But, I have to say the first day of feeding to start it was very hectic."
36,2022-09-23,55," **Interviewer**: Your digester had 2 big white pipes, one an inlet and the other an outlet. How was the outlet like?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it had 2 pipe white pipes. And, I think the outlet was more elevated than inlet."
36,2022-09-23,56," **Interviewer**: I mean, did you dig a hole at the outlet? And, did you get digestate at the outlet?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was making a huge boiling-like sound most of the times it was releasing the digestate."
36,2022-09-23,57," **Interviewer**: Did you put a bucket at the outlet? Or, you simply dug a hole for collection of the digestate?"," **Interviewee**: At the outlet pipe, we dug a hole to collect digestate. So, when we fed the digester, the digestate was failing into the hole."
36,2022-09-23,58," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were you doing with the digestate?"," **Interviewee**: They told us that it could be used as fertilizer for crops and vegetables. But, we made a very big hole, so the hole didn't fill up to collect and use it."
36,2022-09-23,59, **Interviewer**: Did you line the hole?," **Interviewee**: No, it was just a hole."
36,2022-09-23,60, **Interviewer**: Wasn't it bringing mosquitoes?," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't see any mosquitoes in the house. Maybe, it didn't come because the hole was deep, and the digestate was not on the surface or close to the surface."
36,2022-09-23,61, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: They gave us their numbers and told us to call them whenever there was a problem, so they could come to troubleshoot and solve the problem."
36,2022-09-23,62, **Interviewer**: Like what problem?," **Interviewee**: Any kind of problem. For example, if it wasn't producing gas or when there was a gas leak. So, we were supposed to call them whenever there was a problem of any kind."
36,2022-09-23,63, **Interviewer**: Did it ever develop a problem that you called them?, **Interviewee**: No. We never called them.
36,2022-09-23,64," **Interviewer**: Okay, did it meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: No! Like I said, when we fed it, we couldn't use it in the morning. We had to wait up to 10 or 11 AM, when the sun was out to use it. Even then, when we did put a pot on the stove, it was going off once the sun disappeared. Then, we could start looking for firewood to start up fire and continue cooking. The next day, I would put a pot of beans, and then the sun goes and I had to start firewood to continue cook. Then, I was fed up, I was like what type of cooking is this, and then I abandoned it. I stopped feeding it, and it stopped working as well. That's how it was!"
36,2022-09-23,65, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to say this is enough?," **Interviewee**: It took me a month. So, when I saw no improvements, I abandoned it. I was only hoping that the installers would come and fix it. Because, at one point they told me to keep feeding it and not to give up, because they mentioned that the digester would pick up at some point."
36,2022-09-23,66," **Interviewer**: So after commissioning, they came and you told the problem?", **Interviewee**: Yeah. I told them.
36,2022-09-23,67, **Interviewer**: What did they say and what was the end of their coming?," **Interviewee**: They told us that it needed solar panels to supplement it, so that when there was no sunlight solar panels would boost it up to produce energy for cooking."
36,2022-09-23,68, **Interviewer**: So it was like they conceded that the digester could not work on its own?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it showed that the digester could not produce fire alone especially when there was no sun. Hence, solar panels were required to support it."
36,2022-09-23,69, **Interviewer**: Were you able to cook nsima without any problem?," **Interviewee**: The digester was producing fire when the sun was out. But, once the sun disappeared, it was taking a very short time to stop producing fire. So, it was a very discouraging. But, we would have loved to cook on it regardless whether there was the sun or not. Also, I was not able to use it during the late hours of the day. So, I was only able to use it during the afternoon. And even then, it would go off while I was cooking every time the sun disappeared. So that was the main problem."
36,2022-09-23,70, **Interviewer**: Was there a day you were able to cook nsima and side dish?," **Interviewee**: Uumh, I think I managed to cook beans only a single day. But, in most days, it was not working."
36,2022-09-23,71, **Interviewer**: How and why do you think you were able to cook for that long on that particular day?, **Interviewee**: That day the sun was out. It was a very sunny day. It was very hot.
36,2022-09-23,72, **Interviewer**: What challenges were there?," **Interviewee**: The main problem was that it was going off whilst we were cooking. So they should put more ideas to ensure that it stops going off whilst people are cooking. If you start cooking on the biogas, you should finish cooking on biogas whatever you are cooking on it."
36,2022-09-23,73," **Interviewer**: so it is like when you were cooking on it, it was gradually going off, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah (Yeah, Children agrees too in the background)... When the sun was out it was taking a little bit longer. But, when the sun disappeared, it was not taking long to stop working."
36,2022-09-23,74, **Interviewer**: Like how much time?," **Interviewee**: I think it was taking 20 minutes when the sun was out. But, when the sun was not out, it was not long time. After a very short time, it was starting to produce a certain sound, and then it would eventually stop."
36,2022-09-23,75," **Interviewer**: So you only used it for a month, then you abandoned it. And, the time you abandoned the digester, it did not stopped producing fire completely; it was producing very little fire, sometimes not, and sometimes it was going off while you were cooking."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we were fed up. We couldn't imagine cooking under those circumstances."
36,2022-09-23,76, **Interviewer**: Did you call the project implementers?," **Interviewee**: Yes, some days after it was installed, and they came after a week to finalize its documentation. I don't remember if it was them or some other people who told us that the digester needed solar panels to supplement it."
36,2022-09-23,77, **Interviewer**: Who are these people? And what was their agenda?," **Interviewee**: I don\'t know. But, it was not the installers of the digester. They just said they wanted to assess the digester."
36,2022-09-23,78, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this \[sheet of intervention\]?, **Interviewee**: No
36,2022-09-23,79," **Interviewer**: It is information regarding technical problems of digesters and their causes and solutions. What do you think of the information, and do you think it would have helped in your case?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, yeah, and we could have used the information. I mean, the digester was working, so it was simple for us to look at the information and do what the information was saying. So, I think it would have helped because it could have assisted us to identify the problem and fix it."
36,2022-09-23,80," **Interviewer**: Today is 22^nd^ of September 2022. Let us suppose the installers call you and ask about the status of the digester today, what would you say?"," **Interviewee**: I would tell them that the digester continued the way you left it, so we stopped feeding it, and abandoned it. (Laughs)"
36,2022-09-23,81, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) oh," **Interviewee**: We abandoned the digester and we did not we use it anymore. You discouraged us by not following up, so the same way you abandoned it, we also abandoned it. Can't more say? (Laughs)"
36,2022-09-23,82, **Interviewer**: The thing you left us is a clothesline today..., **Interviewee**: (laughs heavily) Aaah
36,2022-09-23,83, **Interviewer**: Better if you had just given us clotheslines...," **Interviewee**: (laughs heavily) the pipe was just staying in the house, so I decided to us it as a clothesline."
36,2022-09-23,84," **Interviewer**: Looking back, how did it reach this state? And, when you consider all things, what caused it to reach this state?"," **Interviewee**: I think it reach this stage because there was no follow-up. And the other thing is that there was no training. They should have told us ""if you see this, do this and that"". So, the implementers should have made us learn it.... Follow up was very important and would have prolonged its lifespan. Because with that we could have been sharing them the problems we were facing, and they would have addressed the issues. So, follow-ups would have help us to communicate our problem and it could have given them an opportunity to tell us how we were faring and that would have motivated us to work hard and use it too. But, after installing it, they never stepped a foot on this compound again."
36,2022-09-23,85," **Interviewer**: Why do you think it never work from the onset? I mean, yes, of course, training and follow up would have helped to keep it running. But, why did you think it never start off? What went wrong? Do you think the digesters were not durable or did the installer did something wrong?"," **Interviewee**: The digester looks durable and of high quality. But, I just don't know how they installed it. I do not know if digesters were made to work in the presence of the sun only. So, after this we called them and after a week they came and explained that it needs solar panels to supplement it. However, on my side, I did everything to make it work, because I knew that to work it needed feeding as they said. But, I just don't know what went wrong."
36,2022-09-23,86, **Interviewer**: How do you meet your energy needs that it is not working? Are you still using firewood only?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
36,2022-09-23,87, **Interviewer**: Where do you get firewood now?, **Interviewee**: We get it where we used to get it before.
36,2022-09-23,88, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock now that it is not working?," **Interviewee**: I just let it dry in the cow house, or pile it on a heap and then use it as fertilizer."
36,2022-09-23,89, **Interviewer**: Someone told me that people burn the manure. Do you do that?," **Interviewee**: I do that when it's excess to repel mosquitoes and ticks, which are a nuisance to the cows."
36,2022-09-23,90, **Interviewer**: How do you repel the mosquitoes when you do not have excess manure?," **Interviewee**: We simply try to clean the cow house as often as we could, but still it\`s not that effective."
36,2022-09-23,91, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. We have about five questions to finish off. How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: I have forgotten.
36,2022-09-23,92," **Interviewer**: But, they did mention the cost?"," **Interviewee**: I am not sure. It's been long, plus we didn't write it down."
36,2022-09-23,93, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: I contributed cow dung, water and labour; I spent a lot of energy on that!"
36,2022-09-23,94," **Interviewer**: Did the digester save you any money? Oh, you mentioned that you only use firewood, and I imagine that you don't buy."," **Interviewee**: We usually source firewood ourselves. But, sometimes when we have money, we do buy people do sell firewood here."
36,2022-09-23,95, **Interviewer**: How much is firewood?," **Interviewee**: Two pieces of firewood cost K150, but was K100. A bundle is K1, 500 or K2, 000."
36,2022-09-23,96," **Interviewer**: The time it worked, did you save money?"," **Interviewee**: I did not save money, because I rarely buy firewood. But, it somewhat reduced the time I was going to look for firewood. I was using only firewood when it was off. So, biogas is good because you do not need firewood. If it worked smoothly, I would not have to search for firewood at all."
36,2022-09-23,97," **Interviewer**: As a beneficiary and someone who has used biogas before, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Biogas is good, and you would have like it to continue working. Nevertheless, I do not know the plans of the project implementers. But, if they come again, we need training to understand it and use it for a long time. We want it again to see and feel its goodness and benefits. The last time we did not really feel it\`s benefits, so we have some unfinished business with it."
36,2022-09-23,98," **Interviewer**: Do you think it has a future? Or, to bring it here again is just a waste of time!"," **Interviewee**: It should have a future because it is a way to go in regards to saving the environment. I am sure, if the beneficiaries we able to run it for long, many people would have adopted it because people did show interest to own the digesters. People now ask what happened, and we tell them it didn\`t work for long. And, when they see that the people who were considered exemplary failed, they do not want it because they feel its unmanageable (laughs). They cannot even dare to get a biogas."
36,2022-09-23,99," **Interviewer**: You cannot. That is like you are starting a war. You are getting yourself in trouble. Last question, If you could have designed your own energy or waste intervention what could you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: (Solar! Child speaks in the background) Yeah, solar. I would choose a solar system capable of producing energy for cooking. Solar system is good because even when there is no sun it works. Solar systems have batteries that are charged by the system itself, and the battery can be used at night for other purpose when the sun is gone."
36,2022-09-23,100," **Interviewer**: In closing, do you have anything to say?"," **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming. In addition, I would like to say we embraced biogas digesters, but you have heard the all problems. If it is possible, ask people back home to come with a technology to save us from this cooking predicament."
36,2022-09-23,101, **Interviewer**: Point taken. Thanks for the interview.,NA
37,2022-09-24,1," **Interviewer**: First question, where did the digester originate from?"," **Interviewee**: It is via Ecogen, which gets it from Kenya, and I think, that is a Mexican company from Sistema."
37,2022-09-24,2," **Interviewer**: Okay, who funded it? Did you use your own money? Or, it is the organization?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, the organization \[Gulugufe\] funded it. We are an NGO from the Netherlands."
37,2022-09-24,3," **Interviewer**: Okay, so as an NGO, what do you do?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we focus on coach, life coaching with people, and we also do a lot of things on sustainability. So, we do sustainable farming sustainable and sustainable buildings; all these buildings are made of mad and there is no cement or anything involved. So, we train in that -- we also train in sustainable farming, and then also coaching, and focus in mindset change in a way of getting people to having a sustainable future instead of, ah, family members having nothing, like living the next generation empty handed like with the trees. So, we are broad, we are not just about trees."
37,2022-09-24,4," **Interviewer**: So, you are from Netherlands?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I am from Netherlands."
37,2022-09-24,5, **Interviewer**: How long have you been here?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I came here first time in 2006 and I was here 8 years. And then, I went three years back to Netherland and now I am here since 2017. It has been almost 13 years now, but always in Chikwawa."
37,2022-09-24,6, **Interviewer**: Don't you find Chikwawa too hot?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it is hot. But, this year is very nice. It's not too hot year. We have only had this two week hot. But, since the flooding in January, Chikwawa has been cool."
37,2022-09-24,7, **Interviewer**: Nice. When was the digester built?," **Interviewee**: It's was built about one and a half years now. Then, after 3 or 4 months after that, we got it in use. That's probably Feb or March 2020."
37,2022-09-24,8, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before? Did you learn about it after Ecogen came?," **Interviewee**: No, I knew already about biogas, but the thing is that most biogas systems, which I knew were focused on kitchen waste. And, I don't see that kitchen has waste, so we feed our kitchen waste to animals. So, the word waste is wrong, so I don't want to use it as biogas. I wanted to use it as manure, but just took some time to find the one which can also do very well with manure, so when I find that one, that's when l started using it. But, just because I didn't want to use kitchen waste in my digester."
37,2022-09-24,9," **Interviewer**: So, what were you expectations?"," **Interviewee**: Well, officially, it has capacity of six families and we are also setting up a restaurant, which in a couple of weeks we want to open up. So, the purpose was also that we could cook with a six-family digester probably most our meals with that. So my expectationwas very high, but it's not reaching my expectations yet. So, I hope it's changing because I'm not using it to the full capacity. I'm using 40kgs to 50 kgs a day and I can go up to 180 kgs that's because I said we're not in full use, but still from 40 or 50 kgs I would have accepted more than what it is supplying me now. So, my expectations was a bit high than the results up to now."
37,2022-09-24,10, **Interviewer**: What did the installers tell you to expect? What did Ecogen tell you to expect?," **Interviewee**: They just give you their forms, what they have from Sistema, like if you put this much in it can be for six families. So they just to give you all the statistics, which comes with it from Sistema. And also, that time when they installed this digester their experience was not big enough yet. But what I did find is that they sometimes went a bit too fast in the success, and they should have waited a little bit. It is success not when we have a flame, but when can use it longer and not just one flame. But, that's how it sometimes goes."
37,2022-09-24,11, **Interviewer**: Did you receive any training from the installers?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, just very, very basic. But, maybe it's enough and some questions come later. Sometimes, I feel their knowledge is not bad, but it's limited when bigger challenges come. And, with the bag we have, which is very big, I think we were the first ones in Malawi, I could see that they were sometimes maybe thinking too much, or thinking too easy and trying out on our bag. So, we were a bit of an experiment at the same time, which I can understand because we are the first ones. But, it's getting better, yeah, they are getting better."
37,2022-09-24,12," **Interviewer**: Why do you say they are getting better? I mean, what can you point out and say they are getting better?"," **Interviewee**: Well, because like now, for example, with the wall they build around it, they are now doing it more, at least that's what they tell me. But, they are making it more complete, so they have learnt, and are adding things which before they were not doing. But, like what I said if the challenge gets too big, then you see that they are lacking a full understanding of how it works -- thinking outside of the box sometimes, like I said in the beginning they put all these pipes, and then it didn't work. Then they came again to change the allpipes that was all on of their cost, but it was so trying out -- we were an experiment. It didn't work so they came to do something else. But, the thing is when you sell something, that's what I think, you have to have enough knowledge, so your customer is happy, in one time, and then you have small mistakes or small adjustments you can come back, but these are big adjustments that they had to make. But, I think if they have learned from that. And now they have new guys before he was on doing it himself, Clement, or he was coming with his friend but not more. And have also acknowledged that some of his guys are much better than others. Now, he has even a Blantyre guy, so they are not coming from Lilongwe anymore. But, it seems they following sometimes a program, when you go outside the program with your problem then they repeat the same answers, but they are not giving you a real answer, you get me? Like I was explaining, I said I don't think that's the problem, and then he's saying it's the problem. I said I think the problem is that valve has to be moved and he says no it will work, but yes it will work but because it's down it will give a lower supply and it's more challenging to get more gas out. But, if it's on top, I think it will go much easier. And, on their pictures, it's even showing like that. Then, I don't get an answer on that he says he doesn't know. And I think the people from Mexico or Kenya they probably know the answer. But, they still have to learn more things and yeah, and we'll see how that goes."
37,2022-09-24,13," **Interviewer**: So, how many people were trained? It just you, or some other guys too?"," **Interviewee**: There are a few people who know how to do it. I'm not filing the bags, but there are people who fill up the bags. And, sometimes they walk on it to shake it a bit and like that. And in the kitchen, they know how to switch it on and switch off. And if there is water log, they know how to disconnect. So, that's what they know, yeah. And, I also explained to them how the gas is made; like that, it is made from bacteria. But, I don't know how much is staying in people's heads. (Laughs) Gas is gas, it doesn't matter who makes it, and I don't care. I put manure, gas comes out, and I don't need to understand the chemical process."
37,2022-09-24,14," **Interviewer**: So, how was the training like? Was it basically on theory and operation? Or, did it touch on maintenance?"," **Interviewee**: I think the theory is more like in practical, so I explained to them how it works, at the same time we doing it. And, I think that's the same with maintenance, if it goes well it doesn't need a lot of maintenance. It's just goes -- or is it maybe the water log. So the water lodge in the beginning, I have to say that the water log I found them very bad. It had water in it, it was blocked every day, so you understand that's very not user friendly. Every day, then you had to go in a small hole; and it's very difficult to get it the rid off to take out the water, so doing that every day was not user-friendly. And, I asked them to make bigger water traps like water can. But, before that, it was like every day it was full. So, I was like if this is the case, this is not working. So, that's also better now. And, what I also noticed is that they don't fit it into the environment. So, there, they made a connection in the middle of the path, and that's not user friendly, you get me? But, I know this happens more in Malawi that it's not always thought about. I would put it corner on the side, and they put it in the middle of the path with a lid on. So, people in the dark they maybe miss it and fall over it. But that has nothing to do with biogas. That has to do with installment. So, it can be made better and user-friendly."
37,2022-09-24,15," **Interviewer**: You have said at first they used pipes different from what you have now and didn't work. And, they came again with different pipes and it worked. What was the dimension of that the pipes?"," **Interviewee**: It was 32 mm and with the short distance of that kitchen, which is 10 - 15 meters, it was fine. But, this kitchen is maybe 20 meters so that's when the problem started. Then, they said you have pumps, then you get pumps but the pumps don't always work as well, or they have solar panels with it, but it's not well installed. Sometimes, I think they were trying to do it a bit fast. So, then in the end they chose to change to a 50 mm pipe, so that kitchen was supplied. But, we even had a kitchen over there that is like 50 meters or something, and even with the pump, it was too difficult to get it fixed."
37,2022-09-24,16, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before biogas?," **Interviewee**: I was using gas bottle from Afrox, LPG gas. What we do with things here is sustainability, and that's why decided to make our own gas because it also fits in sustainability story."
37,2022-09-24,17, **Interviewer**: How much LPG gas were you using per month?," **Interviewee**: It would be different if we used it in the restaurant. We would use it more. So, we used 9kg or a little bit more than that per month - Not a lot. And, we also use wood stove for staff meals. For a restaurant, you will need a lot more, but we haven't run a restaurant with gas bottles. So that's what I can give you a comparison for, unfortunately."
37,2022-09-24,18, **Interviewer**: How did you manage the feedstock before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: What do you mean?
37,2022-09-24,19," **Interviewer**: I mean, what you put in the reactor? Or, what you feed the reactor with?", **Interviewee**: We put cow manure.
37,2022-09-24,20, **Interviewer**: How did you manage cow manure before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: We used it in the gardens, but also we didn\`t have many cows. We had only 1 or 2 cows. So, then we just added more cows to use our own cow manure. So before, it would just go into the gardens. Now, it still goes into the gardens but first in the digester."
37,2022-09-24,21, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning? But before that....," **Interviewee**: It took about two months or something before it worked. And, it was like what I said, at short distances was good, but at long distances it was so good. But, every day we had some gas. Yet, it is not as much as I expected. I mean, if you look at their statistics, this thing produce more gas than in real life. But, companies always make it better than in real life. It's many companies that do that. But, because I haven't used it in full capacity yet, I can't say how less it. Still, I think it is giving less than what they write down themselves. And, maybe also it is tested in perfect conditions in Mexico or wherever they have made it."
37,2022-09-24,22," **Interviewer**: On paper, how much gas does it produce?"," **Interviewee**: They keep it at 6 families a day. That's how they write it. It's not in cubic meters or something like. They just say six families can easily do this in a day. But, I'm using it at the capacity of two families or two and a half families, and I don't believe that two families can cook two meals with this in a day. I don't believe it -- and I'm sure it can't. That's impossible."
37,2022-09-24,23, **Interviewer**: How much cow manure did you start it up?," **Interviewee**: At first, we had a big load in; we put 10 full bags after we had already put water in. And then we kept feeding it everyday with two or three buckets of fresh manure and we mixed it with water still. So that was like maybe 30 kg a day still it was producing. \[Now\] when we use it more we increase the feedstock as well. So if we want more, we put more money. Otherwise, we would be wasting."
37,2022-09-24,24, **Interviewer**: Where did you get cow manure that time?," **Interviewee**: Now, we have cows, but that time we got the manure from the village. There's a lot of cows in Chikwawa, so if I want cow manure I can get it from many places here."
37,2022-09-24,25, **Interviewer**: Did you buy them?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we did."
37,2022-09-24,26, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay?," **Interviewee**: A bag of 50kg was K300 or 400. A bag here is not as expensive as in Blantyre, were you pay K2000 or K3000\... There are no customers here, so they sell something or they sell nothing. And, in most time they don't charge you the manure, but for the labour of loading. So, Malawians get it for free because they fill it up themselves. But, the bags don't get full, maybe the go 75% because the bag is very hard to carry when it's full."
37,2022-09-24,27," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were operation requirements?", **Interviewee**: What do you mean?
37,2022-09-24,28, **Interviewer**: What is required for it to function?," **Interviewee**: We mix cow and water to a certain ratio. I have forgotten but the people who feed it knows that. So, with that, the gas comes out, and if there is a problem like a water log or something, we get it out. So, it's about feeding it everyday."
37,2022-09-24,29, **Interviewer**: How do you exactly fix the water log problem?," **Interviewee**: It's a clear pipe going down, so because water is heavier than gas it accumulates there. So, to deal with it we open the rid and get the water out, and cover it again. So, gas stay up the water, because that\`s what gas likes to do -- stay up."
37,2022-09-24,30," **Interviewer**: (laughs) how do you prepare the feedstock exactly? Do you have a mixer, hand or something?"," **Interviewee**: We have a wooden stir, which our people made themselves and the use that for mixing the feedstock. So, when they are mixing it, and they also take out some rubbish.."
37,2022-09-24,31, **Interviewer**: How many people are responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: We have two.
37,2022-09-24,32, **Interviewer**: Did they go for training too?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I explained to them. So, most of the time one of them is available. They work in shift like manner. And, it's basically the same people who look after the cows that feed it. Then, we have people from the kitchen that uses it, and if there is water log, they fix it. So, it's like different groups of people doing different things on it. So, that\`s how it works in practice. And, then there still people who know much about it, but don't do much with it. They are only needed when there is a problem."
37,2022-09-24,33," **Interviewer**: What are the maintenance requirements? And, who is responsible for maintenance?"," **Interviewee**: Most of the maintenance, we do ourselves. But, if there is a big problem, like when gas was not coming I called Ecogen, or when it\`s twisted. So, Ecogen is doing it because I think they have the expertise. But, it's what I said it's not always like that. So, sometimes I feel they come for nothing, and are not add anything to our solution. But, yeah, that happens (laughs)"
37,2022-09-24,34, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) is it meeting your needs?," **Interviewee**: Not as I expected. But, I hope it will still get better, and also if we can come to a solution on the position of gas valve, then I hope it can still do better. It's nice, but it's doing less than what's on paper. The paper looks better than the reality. But, it works. It\`s not like it doesn't work."
37,2022-09-24,35," **Interviewer**: Did you communicate with Ecogen regarding this? And, if you do what did they say?"," **Interviewee**: I spoke with them to tell them that it\'s not performing well yet. But, it also has different reason, and also I haven't used it full capacity like I said. So, that's the thing, which is not there yet. So, I haven't really confronted them because I don't have the 100% facts when it's in full capacity. Because, I think that's when it becomes a fair thing. But, I\'m expecting that if I use it in a low capacity, I can like a bit equally divide. So, if you can put 180 kg and you put 45 or 50 kg in, then I can at least expect that maybe, if it were six people then at least I would say 2 families should use it. But, that's not what it is, so we have the future is going to bring. Then, I heard your experiences I can say Ecogen is way much better than the others. But, even they still have to learn. But, Clement is a guy who studied economics, and he is learning on the job. So you can say he's a salesman, but not the technical guy. But, he's getting them around it, I think his company is growing and he is more people around him. So, I hope he can find the right people."
37,2022-09-24,36," **Interviewer**: You have been with it for more than a year now, what challenges have you faced?"," **Interviewee**: The water logs, the wrong pipes, but that one had to do with the knowledge on their side. And, now I'm facing that it is still twisted, so I don't know how it can work with that. So, because of these challenge I can't say there has been a time it has been fully functioning well for more than three weeks. There has always been something that had to be changed or adjusted, or something to learn. Now that we have changed everything, we even ourselves we disconnected a house \[House 50 meters away from the digester\] there because they couldn't find a solution to that. So, we have also made our own adjustments, because they kept trying but we already realized that they also don't know what they are doing. And, in continuing using as an experiment, I don't believe that's the way forward because we want to use it. So that's also, why we make our own adjustments, which they know about."
37,2022-09-24,37," **Interviewer**: Oh, you always communicate?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, yeah, and when they came they saw that too. So, that's also there learning process, but how long can you experiment. Of course, he was charging me low prices for that, and sometimes coming for free. It's only lately that he has started charging. So, that's so nice of him. But, they made couplings, they just pushed an STP coupling in a 50 mm pipe, I don't know if you know STP? Like they connected a female coupling, they forced it and made the 50 mm bigger and they forced it in their and put a lot of rubber strips -- you can't do that. So, we were losing all the time gas and we didn't know where it was, till we dug it up, and we were like look at what they've done, and nobody knows who has done it. But, it's one of their guys. But, also things like that, it's unprofessional because of a lack of knowledge. Of course, they have learned, and I hope they will use the experience here with new customers' right."
37,2022-09-24,38," **Interviewer**: I want to know when did you start getting the waterclogs, and how did you know it?"," **Interviewee**: Because there was no gas coming. So, then you start checking the water log and you find out that it's everyday. And, also in the beginning, they also put water logs not at the lowest places, but also at places that was not logical. So, those water logs were not working, and then there was just somewhere the pipe was lower and that's where water was staying because water stays in the lowest of places, which means they didn't use the level when installing it. But, like I have said, it's a learning thing and they didn't think about it. The problem is that they have experimented it for a long time here. So, for water log you just find out that gas is not coming and you just check, and if you see water you just take it out, and it works right away."
37,2022-09-24,39," **Interviewer**: You said the problem of water log was happening on a daily basic, how did you manage to get rid of it once and for all?"," **Interviewee**: We just added water logs along the pipes, and then we put the new pipes \[50 mm in a leveled manner. And the problem was also sometimes that the valve was touching the water that was creating more water \[""madzi""\], I don't know who is listening to this, which was going into the pipes. So, it's those things especially adding more water logs. The first time they added 2 or 3 water valves \[water traps\] I don't know water you call it, and there was a ball in there. When there is gas it pushes the ball down, and when there is no gas the ball goes up. But, the problem was that it was always down, and if you want to get the water out you really had to hit it hard. So, we took out those balls because it was not functioning well, and I didn\'t know how to make it function well. But, I assume that a manufacturer will say it should work with that ball, but I found the ball very annoying."
37,2022-09-24,40," **Interviewer**: When you have a problem and call Ecogen, what's their response like? Do they come on time?"," **Interviewee**: No, if I call, it takes sometimes like 2 weeks. But, I do think they have an office in Blantyre now that means they won't be taking long maybe a few days. But when they were in Lilongwe, they would take two or three weeks, and I could not do anything. So, that's was long time and I assume it's a solved now with Blantyre office."
37,2022-09-24,41, **Interviewer**: How many times have they come back?," **Interviewee**: I think it's 7 to 10 times in two years. And, sometimes I had to wait for a few weeks or a month. \[Wife speaks and thinks it's less -- I don't think they came that many times\] For the record, my wife thinks it is less. So, they came back a little bit less than that. But, I'm convinced it's that. And, I think because sometimes it took them long to come, and that's why I have a feeling that they came that often."
37,2022-09-24,42," **Interviewer**: The challenges, I have noted are water log, and not working at 50 meters distances. Apart from the two, what other challenge have you encountered?"," **Interviewee**: No. Now, we have restarted again it. And now we have to see how we can solve that valve \[valve close to the digester bag\], but we have been cooking on it this week. It seems it is fine, so we just have to experiment this in the next coming weeks to see if we can manage longer three weeks without issues. But, another challenge is that when it goes wrong you have to wait for another one month, so I think that's why many have failed to use it for long like you have said. So, I think they need to teach their customers more than that they are teaching them now, because now they have to come quite often. If there is any problem, they have to come and solve the issue. So they need to explain more, so that the customers can solve most of the issue themselves. The only thing is do they know everything. Like the I said, this last person he sounds more knowledgeable when he speaks, but the words he is saying I don't get the feeling that he is. I think he\'s also learning, and he knows standard things and solutions, but not outside that. But, I don't know maybe because of the digester is big, so also it has big problems. That\`s possible. In Dutch, we would say every customer has his own challenges. So, you can't exactly copy everything the same, because everybody has his own needs and demands. So, I think they have to make it more customer focus, and not believe that every customer is the same. If you have one person, one family, I think you can do almost everywhere the same. But, when you go bigger, you probably need to adjust a lot more to customer needs. And, maybe even teach more. But I'm thinking out loud now (laughs)"
37,2022-09-24,43, **Interviewer**: (laughs) But there is no harm. How would you describe the current state of your digester?," **Interviewee**: Because, it's twisted it's not optimal. But, I do believe it can become like that even without getting it straight. But, what I said then the adjustment has to be made, so how it is now it's not the best. But, it depends on Ecogen to come up with a solution, or then I may have to find a solution myself or your colleague from Uganda, maybe he can give me solutions. And, I have emailed manufacturer from Mexico, because I believe they can give me a clear answer because they are the manufacturers. So, the manufacturer always knows more than the dealer knows, and can offer more solutions. Ecogen is just a dealer, so they may not know more about it than the manufacturers. So, that's why I emailed them, but I haven't got any response yet."
37,2022-09-24,44, **Interviewer**: When did you email them?," **Interviewee**: I emailed them on Monday, which is about that valve. Why is the valve on your pictures on the middle, and why it supplied when it's down? And, maybe in Mexico or in Kenya it's on top."
37,2022-09-24,45," **Interviewer**: When you say it's twisted, what do you mean? What should I see?"," **Interviewee**: It's like this; one side is higher than the other is which means the bag is not on the middle. That's what I mean with twisted; it should be level, but it is not leveled. Maybe, I should use the word leveled, it\`s much easier.. It's not leveled, but it should be leveled, and that one has to do with their installation. They did it wrong. But the thing is it is difficult because when it's empty failed it's folded, and even when you start feeding it the top stays in, and it gets better when gas comes in the end after the outlets are full. Because it the beginning gas can go out via the inlet and outlet. But as soon as it closes with water, then gas can't go anywhere and that's when the bag starts to be pushed up, and that's when you see that it is not leveled. And, that\`s when you have filled up the whole bag with 15,000 liters. So, they must know a way that when they put it, they have to make sure it's 100% leveled. The probably have to push up the corners, and I probably know that is what they said and they even did it here. They blew it up with air, that's when they put it in, and that's what surprises me there. They blew it up and it ended up not leveled. But, they said the time they came to empty my digester bag, it was their second time to do it, and they told me you can't just do it with a pump, but it's not that easy. The slurry is difficult to pump, and they don't have a pump, which can pump it. But, they should have. I can understand though, it's a new thing. I also tried here with a water pump, but it was difficult to get the slurry which settle at the bottom. So, they should get a special pump from South Africa, Mexico or Kenya that can pump the thick slurry."
37,2022-09-24,46," **Interviewer**: Okay, how much did the reactor cost?"," **Interviewee**: I bought it at K1.5 million. And, I think there was a little bit of discount on it because I was one of the first ones."
37,2022-09-24,47, **Interviewer**: Did you pay at once or in installments?," **Interviewee**: That's a good question. I think I might have had short installments. I think, I paid it in just weeks, not in months. So, it was short."
37,2022-09-24,48, **Interviewer**: How many people did the hole?," **Interviewee**: I don't know how many exactly. But, I think they were three or four people in less than one day, and it depends on the soil and season."
37,2022-09-24,49, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay them?, **Interviewee**: I think I paid them K15000 or K20000 altogether. But that's just a rough guess.
37,2022-09-24,50, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay for masonry work?, **Interviewee**: I think I paid the K25000 and K30000.
37,2022-09-24,51, **Interviewer**: How many bricks?," **Interviewee**: Maximum 3000 bricks. The bag is 8 by 2.5 meters, I think."
37,2022-09-24,52, **Interviewer**: How many bags of cement?," **Interviewee**: I would say maybe 4 or 5 bags, because it's just a bricks and a carpet cloth to protect it. There is no plaster."
37,2022-09-24,53, **Interviewer**: How much is that?, **Interviewee**: That one is included in the K 1.5 million. They supplied it together with the bag.
37,2022-09-24,54," **Interviewer**: Since you started using the digester, have you saved any money? Or, are you saving?"," **Interviewee**: No, because it has not been fully functioning. But otherwise, I will. Now because we have been so long in the experimenting phase, I hope to get out of that and then we will save money. But, up to now, we haven't gotten out of the experimenting phase. While in the beginning, I was paying for most of it, now they always ask me money for transport and all that."
37,2022-09-24,55," **Interviewer**: Honestly, do you think you are going to get out of this experimenting phase?"," **Interviewee**: I think so. Also what I have to say is, if you have to buy manure, I don't think you can save money. I think if you compare a person who is buying cow manure to use biogas with a person using LPG gas, then I thinks it's hard to say biogas is cheaper. I think you can only save money, if you use your own feedstock. Thus, if you don't have feedstock, I think LPG gas is..."
37,2022-09-24,56, **Interviewer**: is better., **Interviewee**: Let's say it is the same.
37,2022-09-24,57, **Interviewer**: I thought you were going to say LPG gas is cheaper and better.," **Interviewee**: Maybe it's really better because LPG gas is not really expensive in Malawi. But, I think people think it is. In other countries, it's not any cheaper, and it's cheaper in place where the gas is actually extracted."
37,2022-09-24,58, **Interviewer**: What is the biggest change in your life now that you have a digester?," **Interviewee**: The change is not big yet now, because of these problems. But, I hope in it. I believe if we can get out of this experiment phase and really get it to work. So, within one year if we are saying the same, then we can say this is too difficult -- and then I'll say it produces gas but not as it promises. But, compared to the ones you visited, this is better. And, to us we are for biogas because it's sustainable, but most people in would consider the monetary aspect of it, and use LPG gas. And, also because you only need to pay in a month once, they would choose LPG gas. People would also choose LPG gas because it's not labor intensive. You only need to go the once in a month to refill it."
37,2022-09-24,59," **Interviewer**: I'm remaining with three questions, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: It is a good thing because I believe we have to create sustainable products, and LPG gas isn't. And also, we need alternatives to use of firewood in Malawi, and I see it that it is attainable because we have a lot of manure especially in certain areas like Chikwawa, Nsanje. So, this is a good alternative, but it must improve. And, I honestly do believe that if we would say, it's the Mexican company who produced this and are selling it, I believe if they do it themselves and that's what they also do, I think it works really great. But, to let it work everywhere great, I think that's the challenge. So, if that can be solved, like now that I feel that I'm in experiment, so if they quality it in the application can improve, then there is a big future. But problem is that people look at the wallet and that's why you need quality to convince people. But, now people are just saying it's sustainable, but in the end people look at the wallet. Even now though we don't have the trees, but still you can buy sustainable charcoal from licensed sellers or from illegal local ones and people choose illegal charcoal because it's cheaper. They know that there are no trees, but they would buy the local ones. So it's the same with biogas, if LPG gas is cheap and easy, they will go for the LPG gas, and not for the sustainable one."
37,2022-09-24,60, **Interviewer**: So you think it's a problem with Malawians that they don't think about sustainability?," **Interviewee**: No, it's also in other countries. But, I think a shortage of knowledge, and seriousness. For example, the stories you have shared with the other biogas installers, the company involved was more focused on selling their products than having good results. So, it's more of an earning thing than that passion. They seem not to care about the results and that not about Malawi - it's everywhere. So, I guess if we start caring about the results, things will go well, and if we give up, we will fail. So, when we think about the giving up it's about both the companies and the farmers. I think the farmers can also try harder. I\'m always trying hard to call Ecogen. But, are the other farmers doing the same? So, it's about motivation and seriousness. Are people serious? Do people really want it or they want it easy? For example, we do it because we want sustainable solution, and if that's your focus, then you have to do your best to get it done."
37,2022-09-24,61," **Interviewer**: Five years from now, where do you see biogas in Malawi? Or, do you see yourself in a better position one year or so years from now?"," **Interviewee**: That\`s a difficult question. Yes, I hope. If solution can come for the problems we have, then I\`m sure we will be in a better position. I can have influence on it, but then I have to it myself and I'm not an expert of this. So, I have to start learning things about it myself, but I hope that Ecogen can improve their problem solving capacity, so they can solve problems that are not normal, and then there is hope. And, let's hope people become serious about it. So, in 5 years, it depends on companies and the users, and I believe that for companies like Ecogen, they can reach there. I see that Clement is trying really hard to make it a good company, and he wants to do good service and assist. I think what you have said about the other installers that would not happen with Clement. He is wants the product to succeed and he wants to succeed too. If all companies were like that, it can go two ways. Because I know Malawians who are focused and I also know who are not, so if the other group change and commit themselves, then it has a future. And, commitment can come naturally because trees are running out, and when people have to survive, you see that motivation gets bigger. And it's not as if we can move to LPG gas because Afrox cannot grow so fast to supply all Malawi. Then, the other alternative is electricity, and it's the same thing ESCOM is not going to change so fast. So it's difficult to give you a straight answer, but it will depend on how things will develop in Malawi in the next coming year. And, if commitment and seriousness stays like this, then I don't see that it has a future. And, other companies have to come up because one company is not enough. Of course, he wants to be the only person, but then it's difficult for biogas in general to progress -- and competition is good."
37,2022-09-24,62," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I would have chosen the same bag, but I would the outlet on top. At some place, I would use better quality pipes. And, I would have designed it different -- I would have made a design. I think they just came without a design. They just looked at place they would place the bag and pipes; connect pipes, so that is why the pipes were not leveled like that. So, I would have a better plan to make sure it works. So, like I said they were learning. For example, I would not have used the plastic basins because we all know what happens to plastic when it stays for long on the sun -- it is fine now, but it can\`t last 10 years. So, quality can be better. The bag is of high quality, but the other things the quality has to be better, and especially with UV, so it\'s should be more resistance to UV, and PVC is not a strong material -- the PVC pipes that are here cannot stand the sun; some of the things they have are not from Kenya, it's from in Malawi. So, maybe I think they should not prioritize price more than quality. In Netherlands, we had EPDM, it's also plastic but it's stronger and it's 3 times more expensive than PCV. PCV gives you 10 years, while EPDM gives you 40 years. So, long term EPDM \[Ethylene Propylene Diene Rubber\] is cheaper, and I don't think you can find it here. And, this company supplies South America, India, Africa and Asia, and you can see they are not in countries where people have the highest income."
37,2022-09-24,63," **Interviewer**: In closing, do you have anything to say."," **Interviewee**: Thank you for this interview. I hope it works. And, I hope it will be communicated should to the companies involved, so that companies here should learn from it. And, who knows, it may improve usage of biogas in Malawi, even though part of is not a very good example, what I have heard from you. So those people have probably lost it, and they don't believe it anymore, which is really sad. So, I hope more big companies with good business model come, so we will see. A lot of words."
37,2022-09-24,64, **Interviewer**: How big is your digester?," **Interviewee**: It's Sistema 20, so it's 8 by 2.5 meters. And on the website, you can find more."
37,2022-09-24,65," **Interviewer**: Okay, thanks for the interview.",NA
38,2022-09-24,1, **Interviewer**: There did this digester originate from?, **Interviewee**: The people that came mentioned that they came from Blantyre.
38,2022-09-24,2, **Interviewer**: What was the name of the organization?, **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us.
38,2022-09-24,3," **Interviewer**: When I came here, I told you I'm coming from Poly. Are you sure, they didn't tell you who they were, and where they came from?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they didn't mention that."
38,2022-09-24,4, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you ask?," **Interviewee**: Uh, they did things in a hurry, and they weren't organized."
38,2022-09-24,5," **Interviewer**: Okay, how many people from the installation company came?", **Interviewee**: It was three people.
38,2022-09-24,6, **Interviewer**: Who founded this?, **Interviewee**: They didn't explain that to us.
38,2022-09-24,7, **Interviewer**: I think it came from UNDP.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it could be."
38,2022-09-24,8, **Interviewer**: When was it built?, **Interviewee**: It was in 2017
38,2022-09-24,9, **Interviewer**: What month was that?, **Interviewee**: I have forgotten the month.
38,2022-09-24,10, **Interviewer**: Was your digester commissioned together with the other beneficiaries?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was the same month: the digesters were installed here in Mtolongo and Kachere at the same time."
38,2022-09-24,11, **Interviewer**: I think in Kachere it was in July or August., **Interviewee**: We did things at the same time; we sourced and prepared feedstock at the same time.
38,2022-09-24,12," **Interviewer**: Okay, what was your role?", **Interviewee**: I was a chair of the beneficiaries here.
38,2022-09-24,13," **Interviewer**: Oh, nice! Therefore, you supervised the other beneficiaries."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was there leader."
38,2022-09-24,14," **Interviewer**: Apart from that, what was your other role? For example, you have told me you were responsible for sourcing and preparing feedstock. Apart from this, else did you get involved in?"," **Interviewee**: I dug the hole, and I supported in placing the reactor inside the hole. After that, I collected water 3 drums (200Liters) of water, which was added to the manure. Then, I was responsible for mixing the feedstock that we did put in the reactor."
38,2022-09-24,15, **Interviewer**: How many people dug the hole?, **Interviewee**: I did it myself.
38,2022-09-24,16," **Interviewer**: It must be some work, I can imagine!"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, everything was done in haste. I dug the hole in one day."
38,2022-09-24,17, **Interviewer**: How many people were involved in collecting and preparing feedstock?," **Interviewee**: That was a tough job. I remember we were stacking fresh cow manure in sack bags, and then transporting it in a wheelbarrow or on a bicycle because we got the manure from people within the community."
38,2022-09-24,18, **Interviewer**: Like how far from your home?, **Interviewee**: Some were a bit closer and others were far.
38,2022-09-24,19, **Interviewer**: Did you collect some from your cow house?, **Interviewee**: No.
38,2022-09-24,20, **Interviewer**: How many bags did you collect?, **Interviewee**: It was more than 15 bags.
38,2022-09-24,21," **Interviewer**: Did you do this alone? Or, some people wear helping you?", **Interviewee**: I did this with my wife and children.
38,2022-09-24,22, **Interviewer**: Like how many people?, **Interviewee**: Four people.
38,2022-09-24,23, **Interviewer**: How was it like you getting cow dung from other people?, **Interviewee**: The people here are not stingy when it comes to sharing cow manure.
38,2022-09-24,24, **Interviewer**: I have heard some people just don't allow people to enter their cow houses...," **Interviewee**: Yes, it\'s true. Some people do not allow a stranger to go into the cows houses. If anything, they just go there themselves and give you the manure. Nevertheless, it's not the same."
38,2022-09-24,25, **Interviewer**: Why do people deny other people to access their cow houses?, **Interviewee**: It is because traditional things.
38,2022-09-24,26," **Interviewer**: Why do they do that, for security reasons?"," **Interviewee**: Aah, it's simply because of meaningless beliefs."
38,2022-09-24,27, **Interviewer**: How were you selected as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: Chief \[name redacted\] chose me because he had faith in us that we could manage to do the hard work of feeding it -- it wasn't an easy job, so others couldn't have managed. I'm so dedicated and that's why he decided to choose me."
38,2022-09-24,28, **Interviewer**: Are you dedicated?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and even the installers were surprised by how fast I executed the job, and they were so impressed with the work."
38,2022-09-24,29, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't know anything about biogas. I knew about biogas when I was chosen, and then briefed about requirements and its use it by the installers on the"
38,2022-09-24,30," **Interviewer**: You have told me the chief selected you. How did it all happen? In some areas, for example, in the Kachere, it was the community people who chose the beneficiary at a community meeting called by the chiefs. What was the selection process say?"," **Interviewee**: It's the same here. We were called for a community meeting by the chief. Then, he told the people that five people would be chosen as beneficiaries of biogas. So, at the end, I was chosen together with other people, in front of people of the community."
38,2022-09-24,31, **Interviewer**: So who made the choice? Was it the people or the chief?," **Interviewee**: In this village, we have a chief who is under a senior chief. So, our chief was asked by the senior chief to choose a trustworthy and hardworking person. The same happened with the other beneficiaries. After the beneficiaries were chosen, then the senior chief decided that among the beneficiaries, there should be a leader, and then he chose me as chairperson."
38,2022-09-24,32, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: My expectation was that the work I did was going to reap fruits. For example, I would be able to use the digester for cooking. However, after a short time, I realize that we had wasted the energy for nothing. I gained nothing from it, and I lost a lot. I'm saying this because after the installation of the digesters, our names were not included in any other project. They said that the digester were going to last f long and we were going to benefit from them for a very long time, so it was good for others to get other the things too. Sadly, the digesters never worked, and we gained nothing at all.... We were only involved in hard work, but without reward."
38,2022-09-24,33, **Interviewer**: Which projects were you sidelined from?," **Interviewee**: For example, people received food packages, money and other assorted items when there was hunger, but that time our names were not considered because they said we had already benefited from biogas."
38,2022-09-24,34, **Interviewer**: Saying you had benefited from biogas...., **Interviewee**: Yeah
38,2022-09-24,35," **Interviewer**: But, you didn't get anything from it.", **Interviewee**: You see!
38,2022-09-24,36, **Interviewer**: It was tough. What did the installers tell you to expect from this?," **Interviewee**: The chiefs told us that before installation we would go for training to learn about the digester, for example, feedstock preparation and all that. But, after a week or so, we saw the installers coming to tell us how we should dig holes and that. When we asked to them about the training, they said we would go for training at some point, but we never went for training."
38,2022-09-24,37," **Interviewer**: So you dug the hole, and they were like you would go for training after everything, but you didn't go."," **Interviewee**: yeah, and our Senior Chief was surprised as he was also told that we would go for training before installation. They even told him that we would install the digester according to the training. So, when we started the work the chief didn't do anything, he just let things go."
38,2022-09-24,38," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, why do you think the training never happened?", **Interviewee**: I think someone took out the training component for his gain.
38,2022-09-24,39," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay, I think you have partly, if not fully answered my question. My next question was going to come regardless. What kind of training did you receive?", **Interviewee**: We did not receive any type of training.
38,2022-09-24,40," **Interviewer**: If you did not receive any type of training, then how were you able to switch it on?"," **Interviewee**: After feeding it with the initial feedstock, they came to commission it. When they came, they asked for matchstick and we gave them, and then they lighted the fire. It produced gas, but it was for a very short that you couldn\'t cook anything on."
38,2022-09-24,41, **Interviewer**: So what did you learn? Did they tell you how to make feedstock?," **Interviewee**: No, there wasn't any training on that. They just the said take manure and mix with water. That was all."
38,2022-09-24,42, **Interviewer**: So there was nothing at all," **Interviewee**: There was no training at all. But, in the beginning, they said we would go for training first. Then after that, we would dig a hole, and at the training you would learn how dig a hole. They also said we would learn how to make feedstock, like what's the right ratio for mixing feedstock and all that, but that never happened."
38,2022-09-24,43," **Interviewer**: So, after installation and commissioning of the digester you did not received training. How prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were?"," **Interviewee**: They told us we could manage to use it with the information we received. But then how could we use a thing that didn't work. So, we just abandoned it. Then, they came after some time."
38,2022-09-24,44, **Interviewer**: Like after how long?," **Interviewee**: I think it was after a month. They came late at 6:45PM this other day saying they weren't sitting down, and that I should come with them to their car. In the car, they had forms, and they took the four forms saying I was supposed to sign. I asked them what I was I signing for. They responded that their big bosses sent them, it was urgent, and that's why they even came late. Then, I suggested that we should go to the chief, but they said no because they had already been there. Then, I said okay and signed. Before they went, they just said they were going to bring solar panels."
38,2022-09-24,45," **Interviewer**: Oh, that was after you told them that the digesters were not working?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and that's when they suggested that they should bring solar panels."
38,2022-09-24,46," **Interviewer**: so, it was like the admitted that they had failed and the solution was to bring solar panels?", **Interviewee**: Yeah (laughs)
38,2022-09-24,47, **Interviewer**: (laughs) that was tough, **Interviewee**: (laughs) very tough indeed!
38,2022-09-24,48, **Interviewer**: Do you have papers?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't leave me any paper. They took all four papers I signed."
38,2022-09-24,49, **Interviewer**: Really?, **Interviewee**: I mean it!
38,2022-09-24,50," **Interviewer**: Let's go back to the community meeting where you were selected as a beneficiary. You had the right to say no. I mean I've seen people selected in such circumstances, and saying no for reasons best know to themselves. Why didn't you say no? I mean, why did you accept it to be built here?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, of course, people do say no sometimes when they are chosen to get something. I didn't say no because I found it very useful and beneficial. My wife was even happy because she thought she would no longer go to search for firewood or charcoal. Sure, it's a good thing."
38,2022-09-24,51, **Interviewer**: How useful and beneficial was it going to be for you?," **Interviewee**: It was all about cooking; I thought with the digester, I would be able to cook everything whether it is nsima, side dish, and warm water for bathing, and all that."
38,2022-09-24,52, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: I was using firewood and charcoal.
38,2022-09-24,53, **Interviewer**: Where do you get firewood?, **Interviewee**: I get it at a very far place.
38,2022-09-24,54, **Interviewer**: What is it?, **Interviewee**: It's more like a bush land.
38,2022-09-24,55, **Interviewer**: What challenges do you face there? Do forest officers not protect it?," **Interviewee**: No, where we get wood is not protected. But, if we travel a little bit further to get firewood that's where we meet forest officials."
38,2022-09-24,56," **Interviewer**: If you go at 6:00 in the morning, what time do return home?"," **Interviewee**: If we go at 6:00 in the morning, we come back at 11:00AM"
38,2022-09-24,57," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's some distant. How much is a bag of charcoal?", **Interviewee**: It's K3000
38,2022-09-24,58, **Interviewer**: How many bags of charcoal did you use in a month?, **Interviewee**: We used two bags.
38,2022-09-24,59," **Interviewer**: That's like K6000 a month. To run a digester, you to need cows, did you have the cow that time?", **Interviewee**: No.
38,2022-09-24,60," **Interviewer**: So all the cow menu you are using was from other people. Did you pay for the manure? Or, was it for free?", **Interviewee**: Some people were selling me; some good-hearted people were giving me for free.
38,2022-09-24,61, **Interviewer**: How much was a bag of manure?," **Interviewee**: Some were selling at K500, and others were selling at K1000."
38,2022-09-24,62, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: It didn't work at all\... To tell you the truth, I didn't use it. If I had used it to cook anything, I would have told you... Yes, of course, it produced little fire but it wasn't enough to cooking anything at all."
38,2022-09-24,63, **Interviewer**: From the very first day?, **Interviewee**: Yes
38,2022-09-24,64," **Interviewer**: Some have told me that they cooked nsima once, but you didn't?"," **Interviewee**: To say someone cooked nsima on it here is a lie. No one here ever cooked nsima on it. If people here told you that they used it for nsima on it, they are lying to you. No one ever used it even for boiling water. No one ever used it for cooking. We never used it here! I went to ever house to see how everyone was faring, but I didn't see digester working."
38,2022-09-24,65," **Interviewer**: When the installers came, they said you would use the digesters for cooking. So when that happened, what did they say? What did you say?"," **Interviewee**: I told them that you have seen that it's not working, so how are you going to help us. They said we should not worry because they would come with a different solution. Then, after some days, that's when they came with the papers. Then, I asked them then why they were forcing me to sign papers when the thing was not working. They just said I should not worry, and they would bring solar panels. Then I said okay and signed the papers. Since then they have never come here and haven't brought the solar system."
38,2022-09-24,66, **Interviewer**: So you thought it wasn't worth signing the papers?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and for me I had problems with signing the papers, and I even told them that signing the papers was dubious, and it was like making fools of us. I did not hide any words from them."
38,2022-09-24,67, **Interviewer**: What did they say?, **Interviewee**: They didn't say anything. They don't like dealing with people who are knowledgeable.
38,2022-09-24,68, **Interviewer**: That's something else. How many people did you stay here that time?, **Interviewee**: We were 8 people.
38,2022-09-24,69," **Interviewer**: So on the first day, it didn\`t work? How was the second and third day like?"," **Interviewee**: It was like the first day nothing changed. Moreover, the first day was better because if I light up the burners with matchstick, it was producing flame that would not stay for a minute or so. However, on the second day onwards, it wasn't producing fire at all when lit up. It was zero. Pure zero."
38,2022-09-24,70," **Interviewer**: Did you feed it after? If yes, how many times?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, we fed it for two days, and then we gave up."
38,2022-09-24,71, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?, **Interviewee**: They acknowledged that the digester was producing very like fire. They said to make it work it would need solar panels to boost it up.
38,2022-09-24,72, **Interviewer**: (laughs) oh," **Interviewee**: The installers were crooks. They weren't here to install the digester, but to fill their stomachs and that's why there was no order."
38,2022-09-24,73," **Interviewer**: So to make it work, I imagine you needed cow manure together with the so-called solar panels. What else was required?"," **Interviewee**: We only needed to mix cow manure with water, and then stir the mixture until the feedstock was somewhat thick. In the process, we were advised to remove trash to avoid blockages."
38,2022-09-24,74," **Interviewer**: How much did you feed it, and how often?"," **Interviewee**: I was collecting one bag (50kgs) of manure. Then, I was removing trash from the manure whilst mixing feedstock until the feedstock was thick and smooth."
38,2022-09-24,75, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add?," **Interviewee**: I was adding 2 buckets (20 liters) of water to each one bag, and then mix thoroughly until suitable slurry."
38,2022-09-24,76," **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock? I mean, did you use a mixer or something?", **Interviewee**: I was mixing the feedstock using hands without any protection in order to break lumps and remove trash until the slurry was suitable... They lied to us that they would give us gloves (laugh)
38,2022-09-24,77," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Oh, they lied to you that they were going to give you gloves...."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they also lied to us that they would supply us with work suits. And, after those broken promises, I had a feeling that things would not end well."
38,2022-09-24,78, **Interviewer**: Didn't you feel that handling cow manure with bare hands was risky to your healthy?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but we felt like they forced us to work without protection. I mean, they said they would provide gloves but didn't. Still, they were asking us to work, so could we have said no?"
38,2022-09-24,79," **Interviewer**: Yeah, you still had to work. I mean, if you didn't work, it would have seemed as if you were unwilling to get the digester. Where did you say you used to get cow manure?", **Interviewee**: That side.
38,2022-09-24,80, **Interviewer**: How far is it from here?, **Interviewee**: It's relative far.
38,2022-09-24,81," **Interviewer**: If you walk or use a bicycle, how long would it take you?", **Interviewee**: It was taking 30 minutes to go and return on a bicycle.
38,2022-09-24,82, **Interviewer**: This is like an hour walk. Who is responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: I was responsible.
38,2022-09-24,83, **Interviewer**: Alone?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
38,2022-09-24,84, **Interviewer**: You mean no one was supporting you in any way?, **Interviewee**: The women were supporting me in water collection. I was the responsible for feedstock preparation and feeding the reactor.
38,2022-09-24,85, **Interviewer**: Where did the women get water?, **Interviewee**: It's not far. We have a borehole there.
38,2022-09-24,86, **Interviewer**: Where?, **Interviewee**: Behind that tree
38,2022-09-24,87, **Interviewer**: That's like 100 meters. Not bad.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, sourcing water wasn't a problem. So, we were collecting water in the evening, so that we could use it the next day."
38,2022-09-24,88," **Interviewer**: Oh, okay. Did you soak the manure?"," **Interviewee**: No, the manure was always fresh, so we couldn't do that. We simply collected water in the evening to be effective and lessen the workload. It takes time to get water in the morning as everybody is there."
38,2022-09-24,89," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. How did you feel about preparing feedstock and feeding the reactor?"," **Interviewee**: It was a tough job. It was very tiresome. It wasn't easy to feed the reactor. We did the job from morning to late afternoon to fill up the digester bag, so you can see that it was very tough, for sure."
38,2022-09-24,90," **Interviewer**: How many times did you feed it altogether? I mean, you said it is the first time to start it up with 15 bags and 3 drums of water. After that, you feed it regularly with feedstock not as much as the first time to keep it running, how often were you supposed to feed it?"," **Interviewee**: No, no. The installers told us to fill the reactor with huge amount of manure and water, and after that, there was no need to feed it again. And, we did this work in two days."
38,2022-09-24,91, **Interviewer**: You mean you didn't feed it again after the initial feed?," **Interviewee**: We didn't feed it after that. The installers told us to feed it with enough water and feedstock until it was full. So, we did that for two days until the back was full. After that we were done."
38,2022-09-24,92, **Interviewer**: And you didn't feed it again after that?," **Interviewee**: We didn't because they told us to feed it only once. So to feed the reactor again would have compromised it, because it had reached its level. So, if we had feed it after, it would have exploded."
38,2022-09-24,93," **Interviewer**: So, you mean you only fed it once?"," **Interviewee**: I didn't because it only needs to be fully fed once, and after that it enough and it keeps running on it' own"
38,2022-09-24,94," **Interviewer**: Some people after feeding it the first time, they also feed it regular maybe with 2 buckets of manure a day or two or even a week..."," **Interviewee**: Aaah, they didn't tell us that. What's the purpose of feeding it again? If you can feed it again, then it may even explode. I mean, when it's full it really gets full. You can even stand on the reactor without it being shrunk (laughs)"
38,2022-09-24,95," **Interviewer**: (Laughs) so, they didn\'t talk about feeding it afterwards?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
38,2022-09-24,96, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: To tell you the truth, they didn't talk anything about maintenance. They didn't tell us whom to consult when we had a problem. They didn't tell us anything. They were doing things without organization; they just cared about their welfare not about us."
38,2022-09-24,97, **Interviewer**: They didn't give you their numbers to call them when you had a problem?," **Interviewee**: Nothing. They didn't give me their number, but they took mine."
38,2022-09-24,98, **Interviewer**: You didn't ask them what you were supposed to do when there was a problem?," **Interviewee**: I did, but they only told me that they would know when it's not working, and then they would be coming."
38,2022-09-24,99, **Interviewer**: (laughs) how would they know it had a problem?," **Interviewee**: I don\'t know. They just said they would be coming regularly. That was all. And, I was like, oh, you would be coming, and I stopped because I didn't want to bother them - they are bosses."
38,2022-09-24,100," **Interviewer**: Certainly, it didn't meet your needs...", **Interviewee**: Not at all. It didn't work at all. Nothing happened.
38,2022-09-24,101, **Interviewer**: You didn\'t even cook on it once..., **Interviewee**: Not
38,2022-09-24,102, **Interviewer**: Porridge?, **Interviewee**: No.
38,2022-09-24,103, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: Firstly, it's the fact that it did not work at all. Secondly, we were sideline from other projects by the chief, so it got us in trouble. The other thing is that people were making fun of us; they were like what have we gained from all the effort. They even blame us for accepting the digester. They said they were clever to not to accept the digesters, but we were dump. They were asking many provocative questions like why did you accept it, and what have you gained from it? They even said that we became fools for accepting the digesters. So, it affected us a lot because laughing stocks to the community. And, that\`s why most people just got the digester out of the hole and torn them out of anger (laughs)"
38,2022-09-24,104, **Interviewer**: (laughs) oh," **Interviewee**: Yeah, most people got the bags out because they didn't benefit anything from it. The beneficiaries wondered how the project implementers gave them useless things like the digesters. People were very angry because they were sidelines from other benefits or community projects for accepting the digester. As a result, most people took out the reactors from the hole and tore them. As for me, I did not take it out; I just left it in the ground."
38,2022-09-24,105, **Interviewer**: Why were the people making fun of you?," **Interviewee**: The installers told us that would go for training, and that people would not buy charcoal or firewood for cooking. But, they said it's not easy to start using it because it's need a lot of work at the beginning. So, some people when they heard they couldn't manage it. Some people who were even chosen as beneficiaries denied it, because they though the job was too hard. But for us we accepted the challenge, and we expected to benefit. So, when the people saw that digesters weren't working and that we were being sidelined from projects, they started talking. They were like we had been cheated. They mocked us for not going for training. So, it was a challenge, but we accepted it because such is life."
38,2022-09-24,106," **Interviewer**: From experience, most community people become more attracted in the project when you talk of training. In your opinion, why is that?", **Interviewee**: \[Stays quite for a time\]
38,2022-09-24,107, **Interviewer**: Have you understood me?," **Interviewee**: I have understood you very, very much. You have asked me why community people are attracted to projects that involve training. People become attracted to such projects because people expect to learn things that they don't know. They also expect that after the training they would be taught to act differently in a way that can benefit their lives. Also, that time, they told us that once we undergo the training, we would be training other people on biogas so that more people would be attracted to it, and eventually adopt it. So, people thought it was interesting to learn the benefits of biogas and teach others to protect the environment. So it was sad that we expected all these things, but it never happened, and that's why people became angry."
38,2022-09-24,108, **Interviewer**: So it\'s not about the training allowance that motivates people?," **Interviewee**: To some it's that, you know, it takes all kinds to make the world. So, some people associates trained with allowances (money), but some like trainings because they want to learn."
38,2022-09-24,109, **Interviewer**: You have opened my mind on that. I was failing to understand why community people become more interested in community project once there a training component. I have seen people showing little interest to wishing to be group leaders once you mentioned training...., **Interviewee**: What you are saying is true. What most people think of trainings is money. It's true.
38,2022-09-24,110," **Interviewer**: I want to have a clear picture of the fire you got on the day commission. You say you couldn't cook on the fire because it wasn\'t strong enough. What kind of fire did you get? Did the flame stay for long but the flames very little? Or, you got strong flames but didn't stay for long?"," **Interviewee**: It was a very weak fire and it stayed for a very short time. And, that's why they were quick to say they needed solar panels to boost it up (laughs). The fire was very little upon ignition, and in a short time, it was going off. If stayed for long, for 30 minutes, then we would have been using it. But, it was just staying for a very short time. And, that was the same with all other digesters, because I did follow up the other beneficiaries, as I was there chairperson."
38,2022-09-24,111, **Interviewer**: Did you meet as a group of beneficiaries and talk?," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't have the energy to do that after all that had happened. It showed that it had no future."
38,2022-09-24,112," **Interviewer**: so the solar that was coming, was it supposed to be connected to the digester or the solar system was coming as a different entity?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know. The installers talked about it, and I didn't really discern what they were proposing. I was just listening and nodding to their proposal. So we were only waiting for the solar panels to see whether they would work or not."
38,2022-09-24,113," **Interviewer**: It didn't work, and they didn't give you their numbers. Did you do anything to fix it?"," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't"
38,2022-09-24,114, **Interviewer**: So you just abandoned it?," **Interviewee**: We went to the chief and he told us not to do anything, but wait for the installers, as they communicated that they would come."
38,2022-09-24,115," **Interviewer**: yeah, so that was one way of not making ...", **Interviewee**: Of making the problem bigger.
38,2022-09-24,116," **Interviewer**: Yeah. Today, if the project installers call you to inquire about the digester, what would you say to them? What is the current state of your digester today?"," **Interviewee**: I would tell them vividly that the thing you gave us is not working us, just like you left it. There is nothing."
38,2022-09-24,117, **Interviewer**: Do you have the equipment?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I have. I have all the equipment. But, my friends removed the bags from the hole."
38,2022-09-24,118," **Interviewer**: Before the interview, you mentioned the pipes."," **Interviewee**: Oh, some people came, not the installers, and they said they would bring solar panels too, I asked them to see the pipes that were damaged by the sun. And, they saw that."
38,2022-09-24,119," **Interviewer**: And, what did they say?"," **Interviewee**: That they would bring different pipes. You know, it is easier said than done."
38,2022-09-24,120," **Interviewer**: Oh, okay. You have talked a lot and I've talked a lot regarding the digester. When you look back today, how did it reach this stage? And, what do you think you caused it?"," **Interviewee**: I think it reached the stage because the project implementers did not have order in the execution of the project. And it looks like it was an organized plan that these things should not work. And if you ask, any beneficiary they would tell you the same. The project implementers did not want us to use the digesters and that's why they did things anyhow. I mean, if they had trained us and leave their numbers things would have worked. There was need for communication between them and us regarding its functionality. The problem is that they just got our numbers and didn't leave us their numbers. And when it didn't work, they lied about the solar system."
38,2022-09-24,121, **Interviewer**: Do you thing someone would come all the way from Blantyre to give you something he or she knows won't work?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it happens. They just wanted money. The only cared about their wellbeing. This project was about them and not us. It had nothing to do with us. We were just pawns."
38,2022-09-24,122, **Interviewer**: How do you meet your energy needs now?, **Interviewee**: I use firewood and charcoal.
38,2022-09-24,123, **Interviewer**: How much charcoal do you use in a month?, **Interviewee**: It's the same like before (2 bags of charcoal)
38,2022-09-24,124, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: They didn't tell me anything about its cost
38,2022-09-24,125, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you who paid the money?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't."
38,2022-09-24,126, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: I can only think of the equipment we use used for working.
38,2022-09-24,127, **Interviewer**: What equipment?," **Interviewee**: For example, the buckets and sack bags for carrying cow manure!"
38,2022-09-24,128, **Interviewer**: Some say they cooked nsima with chicken for the installers as a token of appreciation....," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't do that. I shouldn't lie to say I gave them something to eat. I would be sinning to God to say I gave them something."
38,2022-09-24,129, **Interviewer**: Was any masonry work involved? Did you line the hole?, **Interviewee**: No
38,2022-09-24,130, **Interviewer**: Why not?, **Interviewee**: They didn't ask us to line the hole.
38,2022-09-24,131, **Interviewer**: Okay. What special items have to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they told us that the digester was from another country."
38,2022-09-24,132, **Interviewer**: Which country?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't specify."
38,2022-09-24,133," **Interviewer**: When you look back at the digester, you can say it helped you to stop sourcing firewood or save you money... or any of its objectives."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, the same way it was before the digester, was the same way after its installation, and it is the same way now."
38,2022-09-24,134, **Interviewer**: It only brought shame!, **Interviewee**: It only brought shame on this household! (Laughs)
38,2022-09-24,135, **Interviewer**: (laughs) it's sad. We are remaining with 3 questions. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: (laughs heavily) with the experience I had, there is nothing good I can say about biogas. (Laughs). I can only talk bad things about it... Does it have any benefit? No, no (laughs). If it had something good about it, the whole village would have known because I could have spread the message. I remember when you called, I talked with one woman who was also a beneficiary, and she was like you should not go there, you should only stop here (laugh). And, I was like the person just wants to ask few things, and she was like no, no way, they shouldn't come. Those people cheated us, and shouldn't cheat us again... We became laughing stocks in the community because of them, and after all this time, why should they come (laughs)."
38,2022-09-24,136," **Interviewer**: Oh, so you can only talk bad about it?"," **Interviewee**: And it\`s not only me. Every beneficiary would talk bad about it, because no one saw its positive side. But, maybe, biogas itself is good and we think it is bad, because some individuals failed to make them run."
38,2022-09-24,137, **Interviewer**: What bad things can you say about it?," **Interviewee**: I can only say, I did not use about Biogas, and it did not work. So, that's the bad thing about it. And on top of it, we became laughing stocks before the community because of it. But, I don\'t know if it works in other communities with the expertise that was given to them."
38,2022-09-24,138, **Interviewer**: Do you think training would help?," **Interviewee**: The installers know how these things work, so they should transfer that knowledge to the people to make it work. In our case, things were done in shortcut. They should have had a step-by-step approach on how biogas work and can be maintained, and transfer the skills to us. It's sad they didn't do that."
38,2022-09-24,139, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: The basic principle of biogas in Malawi is that people should benefit from it by using it for cooking in their homes, thereby protecting and maintaining the environment. I think that's what biogas is about that. So, many people would generally have interest in that, and would love to use it. But, if it is implemented as it was in implemented here, I don't think people would love to adopt it."
38,2022-09-24,140, **Interviewer**: So you thinking people in a community setting like this are interested in saving the environment?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and we are big on that. People don't encourage one another to plant trees, and have woodlots to save the environment."
38,2022-09-24,141, **Interviewer**: What is the important of trees or the environment to the community?," **Interviewee**: Trees are very important because they bring rain they protect the ground from soil erosion, and it acts as a windshield when there is too much wind etc."
38,2022-09-24,142, **Interviewer**: I like the way you have articulated it. How did you learn this?, **Interviewee**: (laughs) I went to school
38,2022-09-24,143," **Interviewer**: (laughs) I see. Last one, if you could have designed your waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: There are so many alternatives that I would have liked to see. When we go to other communities, we see people using solar energy, so I would like to see this community using that. Solar is good. Then, you can also think of electricity. We would like to see that as well."
38,2022-09-24,144, **Interviewer**: I have seen a power line., **Interviewee**: It's on that side where the maize meal is. It hasn't reached here.
38,2022-09-24,145, **Interviewer**: Why have you chosen those?, **Interviewee**: Maybe those things can work. Biogas has failed.
38,2022-09-24,146, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: I think you have the expertise to make something work. And, I didn't have a chat with the other people like we have. The other people seemed in a rush, so I believe this conversation will lead to something good."
38,2022-09-24,147," **Interviewer**: That was my last question, in close do you have anything to say?"," **Interviewee**: I'm very happy you came, and I would like to apologize for not finding me yesterday. It is good today we sat down and have a good conversation, I'm very happy. Thanks."
39,2022-09-27,1," **Interviewer**: First question, where did the digester originate from?"," **Interviewee**: It came here with a company called Energy Saver. But, when they gave us we had no training. They simply said that I should expect good thing to come, and that they would come back. So, I have waited from 2017 up to date, but they have never showed up. But, since then three other groups of people have come to follow up. One time, people came from Lilongwe came to follow up. They spoke English and thought I was not following whatever they were saying, as my English is good, you know how powerful the old school was here in Malawi. However, I did not like the way they questioned me because it was as if they were trying to lead me to something. Then, at the end, they commented in English that I was old, and I asked them if I answered their question offline, and they said no. That time they came seven people. Then, another group came last year to follow-up as well. Simply put, the installers were from a company called Energy Saver and they said the digesters were from China or some other country. It has been long so, I cannot remember vividly."
39,2022-09-27,2, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: There was no time they told me where the money came from. But, the people from agriculture told me that I was going for training. I believe I would have learnt where the funds came from there."
39,2022-09-27,3, **Interviewer**: Was the agriculture office involved?, **Interviewee**: They were the ones who were spearheading this here. It was Mbonechera EPA together with the installers who came here that time.
39,2022-09-27,4, **Interviewer**: When was this?, **Interviewee**: It was 2017.
39,2022-09-27,5, **Interviewer**: You have a very sharp memory. How many people came to build this?," **Interviewee**: I think it was four, if not five people."
39,2022-09-27,6, **Interviewer**: How many people from your side supported the building of this?," **Interviewee**: It was basically me. However, my five children also supported me in sourcing manure."
39,2022-09-27,7, **Interviewer**: How long did you take to build this?," **Interviewee**: They did give a deadline and I met it. But, I have forgotten how long it was. They also wrote on a piece of paper the things I was supposed to source, and I did. I believe they said I was supposed to source 10 buckets or something, I do not know. But, they did not teach me anything."
39,2022-09-27,8, **Interviewer**: What was written on the paper?," **Interviewee**: They wrote the number of water and cow manure I was supposed to source. And they told me to use fresh cow manure that I got from well-wishers. So after I got the feedstock, I prepared it, fed the digester and the bag got full."
39,2022-09-27,9," **Interviewer**: Apart from sourcing and making feedstock, what else did you do?", **Interviewee**: I hired someone to make a hole.
39,2022-09-27,10," **Interviewer**: How many were they? And, how much did you pay them?"," **Interviewee**: It was one person and I paid him K3500. And, he took 2 days to dig the hole."
39,2022-09-27,11," **Interviewer**: I thought you had five children. I mean, was that not enough?"," **Interviewee**: It was small school going girls and boys, who could not managed to dig a hole."
39,2022-09-27,12," **Interviewer**: Okay, where did you get your manure?"," **Interviewee**: I got goat manure from my got house. I had seven goats that time. And, the manure I got from my goat house was not enough, so I got some from other people."
39,2022-09-27,13, **Interviewer**: How is it like to get manure from other people.," **Interviewee**: There was no problem because people were interested to see how the digester was going to function. And, I did my best to allure people to give me manure by trying to sell the concept of a biogas system and that it was an opportunity for them too to learn from me, and then eventually adopt it."
39,2022-09-27,14, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) oh," **Interviewee**: Oh, yeah. I was doing that."
39,2022-09-27,15," **Interviewer**: I was in Tengani, Nsanje last week; it seems that people do not allow other people to go get manure in their animal houses..."," **Interviewee**: The people in Tengani use cow manure, right? It is common with cows. In our case, we used goat manure to start it up, so it was not much of a problem. It was only one woman who denied manure, because she thought I was going to use it as fertilizer so she asked me to pay."
39,2022-09-27,16, **Interviewer**: What do you think they do that?, **Interviewee**: They do black magic to make their cow management successful.
39,2022-09-27,17," **Interviewer**: Oh, why don't they do that with goats?"," **Interviewee**: Some do, but it is not common in goats farming because goats are considered less valuable."
39,2022-09-27,18," **Interviewer**: How many bags of manure and water did they ask you to find? Or, how bags of manure did you find?"," **Interviewee**: It was a lot. I remember they asked me to find one drum of water that was to be mixed with manure. However, I don't remember the quantity of manure I was asked to find, and which I found. I had no standard measure as I was getting manure, and then mixing it with water without counting. And, some of the bags were full somewhat not full, so I can't say exactly how manure I got."
39,2022-09-27,19," **Interviewer**: In this community we have so many people and so many households, how were you and your family selected as a beneficiaries?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know what really happened, but in this community three other women were chosen and denied it. As for me, I accepted it."
39,2022-09-27,20, **Interviewer**: Why did they deny it?," **Interviewee**: They said they wouldn't be able to manage it, and thought it's a tedious. And, indeed, it was a burden and very tedious, but I soldiered on."
39,2022-09-27,21," **Interviewer**: So, in this community you are the only one who got it?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, there is one beneficiary from another village, which I'm aware of. His name is \[name redacted\]. He is a chief."
39,2022-09-27,22, **Interviewer**: A very charming man is his own way. I think I was there before coming here., **Interviewee**: How is his digester like?
39,2022-09-27,23," **Interviewer**: It\`s bad. He told me that the installers didn't install it. But, they only gave him some of the equipment, like digester bag and pipes. Then, they were told him they would come again, but never did."," **Interviewee**: I also went to the agriculture office with Chief \[name redacted\] to get the equipment. He dug a hole, but I\'m not sure if they installed it there because there were fears that his house was in a footpath. So, he thought it was not going to be safe."
39,2022-09-27,24, **Interviewer**: How was the selection process like?," **Interviewee**: I think the chiefs chose hard working people. For example, the chief I went to collect materials with was very committed to this. I remember, I went to his house and he had already dug the hole. He even placed the digester bag in the hole, but he removed it when he saw that too many people were passing by, and he was also waiting for me to finish, and call the installers."
39,2022-09-27,25," **Interviewer**: How did the Chief chose you? I mean, how did you know that the chief know you? What happened?"," **Interviewee**: When the project came out chief was called to the Traditional Authority meeting place. Then, he volunteered to get the digesters and become a change agent. And, I myself was very willing to be a change agent too."
39,2022-09-27,26," **Interviewer**: So, I want to know how you become a beneficiary. How did you learn first about it? Was it through the chiefs or extension workers?"," **Interviewee**: The chief recommended the extension workers to come here. Then, the extension workers came here to tell us what to do. So, I dug a hole there, but I was told to dig close to the kitchen. My initial thought was that the bag was primarily for making fertilizer, I didn't think of it as a technology for cooking, and that's why I built it close to the animal house initially."
39,2022-09-27,27, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas?, **Interviewee**: I only knew of biogas when they brought it here.
39,2022-09-27,28," **Interviewer**: You had the right to say no, and you have even said some women said no, why did you accept to build it here?"," **Interviewee**: I was interested because I heard on the radio that some people were using biogas like electricity (for lighting, source of power for TV) as well as for cooking. And, when I heard that it uses goat manure, I thought it would be easy for me for me to manage."
39,2022-09-27,29, **Interviewer**: So you heard about it on the radio before they came?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I heard some time back a certain woman saying she was able to use manure for lighting as well as cooking. And, indeed, after they installed it, I was able to cook on it during the first days. But, the problem was that they did not give me spare parts, so when the gas valve broke I couldn't replace it. When I called the two numbers they gave me, I was getting a response of wrong number."
39,2022-09-27,30, **Interviewer**: Did you cross check the numbers?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I did. And, I even tried to copy the numbers by transferring the numbers onto a different paper. I called the numbers and the same person who was saying wrong number."
39,2022-09-27,31, **Interviewer**: So you think it was them?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I believe it was them. Because, some days after installation, I called the same number to report the issue, and we talked. That time they told me they would come after the rains, it was in May, and when I was called after the rains that's when I was getting the wrong number response."
39,2022-09-27,32, **Interviewer**: Was it the same voice?," **Interviewee**: I'm not sure if it was the same voice or not. But, I called the same number they gave me, and I called them on the same number and we talked before. So, that's I'm saying it was the same number."
39,2022-09-27,33," **Interviewer**: Oh, sad. What were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: I expected to use it for cooking, just like I was telling other people. And, I was very sure that if it could work as they promised, I would be able manage it and teach others about it."
39,2022-09-27,34, **Interviewer**: What did they promise?," **Interviewee**: They the digester would be used for cooking and lighting, and that we would teach others about it."
39,2022-09-27,35," **Interviewer**: Apart from this, what did they tell you to expect?"," **Interviewee**: After installation, they talked things that motivated me. For example, they assured me that the digester was going to pick up and I would be able to cook and use it for lighting. They also said they would be following up on me. They asked me question like how many are you, how many rooms does your house have, and I found they questions compelling and hopeful that something good was going to happen. But, since then they have never come back."
39,2022-09-27,36," **Interviewer**: What type of training did you receive? If I'm not mistaken, you are saying you did not receive training, then how are you able to switch it on?"," **Interviewee**: They simply showed me how to switch on and off the stove. And they told me that the bag produces gas when the bag is full. Then, because they did not give me the spare parts, once the gas valve handle broke, I failed to switch it on again. The gas valve broke because it wasn't durable enough. And they told us to call whenever there was a problem, but when I called them that's when I was getting the wrong number response."
39,2022-09-27,37, **Interviewer**: What exactly broke?, **Interviewee**: After the digester bag a part \[gas valve\] meant to allow gas to enter the pipes broke.
39,2022-09-27,38, **Interviewer**: How did you know that there was a problem?, **Interviewee**: It was producing moist.
39,2022-09-27,39, **Interviewer**: Was it producing a certain smell?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it did! And, after I dug the hole, they gave me a poster of a digester showing a digester with two holes; one was for the digester bag and the other one was for collection of the digestate. But, my digester had one hole for the digester bag only and they didn't tell me about the hole meant for digestate collection. So, I don't know what happened about that hole because they didn't train me."
39,2022-09-27,40," **Interviewer**: Yeah, you are right that digester do have two holes; one for the digester bag and the other one is for collection of digestate at the outlet. So, people do dig a hole at the outlet to collect digestate that is used as fertilizer. So you are saying that the installers didn't tell you to make a hole for the digestate?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they didn't tell me that. And, ah, to say the truth the way they brought the digester here I just feel like something dubious was happening behind the scenes. And, I asked them why my digester only had one hole and unlined with a plaster or brick wall, while the digester on the poster had two holes both lined. They told me that everything was okay and they didn't even ask me to dig another hole for the digestate, and from that time on I never saw them again. And, if you could have seen how the digester was built here and that from the picture you would see how different they were. I still have the poster in my house, but I just don't know where specifically it is now."
39,2022-09-27,41," **Interviewer**: Yeah and that's also true, digesters need to be lined with a brick wall or something. So you said you brought the issue to them?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they said everything was okay. And if a problem came, we should inform them. However, when the digester bag started rising goats were stepping on it as they were moving around because there was no protection around it. As for the digestate, it wasn't a problem because it never flashed out digestate."
39,2022-09-27,42, **Interviewer**: So you are saying after everything was done you felt that there was something shady about the whole thing...," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that's what I thought (laughs). They came six times, but there was no order in their visits. They didn't down as you have and talk things as we are now. They were just coming, and then move around. Sometimes, they could find me coming out of the bathroom, and take a picture and I was like why were they doing things, so fast and without respect."
39,2022-09-27,43," **Interviewer**: That's so disrespectful. So after installation, how prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were?"," **Interviewee**: No, and after the plastic thing broke at the gas valve it started deflating and it stopped. Then, after the bag shrunk, it was trouble. One day as one of my children was playing fall into the pit and people advised me to take it out as it had a potential of causing harm to children. Also, after the rains started the digester bag got covered with soil as soil was collapsing into the digester, as a result of soil erosion. I was trying to remove the soil, but it was too much so it didn't work."
39,2022-09-27,44, **Interviewer**: A child fell in the digester?," **Interviewee**: Yes, my child fell in the digester pit, but lucky enough she landed on the digester bag that had air, so she was not injured. After people saw this, I was advised to take it out."
39,2022-09-27,45, **Interviewer**: Did you use it?," **Interviewee**: I used it for a very few days. I used it for a week, I think."
39,2022-09-27,46, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: I was simply using firewood.
39,2022-09-27,47, **Interviewer**: Where did you get firewood?," **Interviewee**: I didn't have a problem with sourcing firewood that time. As you can see the forest is not far from here. Also, I have a lot of trees around as you can see. But, things are now different because people have cut down a lot of trees from the forest for the purpose of making charcoal. Now, as a community, we have even started stopping people from making charcoal from our forest."
39,2022-09-27,48, **Interviewer**: Where did you start noticing the change that the forest is running out of trees?, **Interviewee**: It's been some time now.
39,2022-09-27,49, **Interviewer**: 2 years?, **Interviewee**: 10 years or so
39,2022-09-27,50, **Interviewer**: How are you coping now that wood is not as abundant as it was?, **Interviewee**: It's not easy as it was. Now we also use maize cobs and dry pigeon peas plants.
39,2022-09-27,51," **Interviewer**: Oh, it doesn't look sustainable. So, what will happen after that?"," **Interviewee**: I should ask you how I would survive without biogas (laughs). I mean, it's true that we are running out of firewood, so you should have come up with you as you do support us in terms of cooking."
39,2022-09-27,52, **Interviewer**: (laughs) Sure. You said you had goats and I think you still have goats....," **Interviewee**: Yes, I had goats, but now I'm only remaining with four goats."
39,2022-09-27,53, **Interviewer**: How many goats did you have when they brought the digester?, **Interviewee**: I had seven goats.
39,2022-09-27,54, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your goat manure that time?," **Interviewee**: I was simply collecting manure, and then place it in the ridges at my farm."
39,2022-09-27,55, **Interviewer**: How does it work?," **Interviewee**: It somehow doesn't work. I don't know if I'm the problem because the manure sometimes break down but it wilts my maize. Maybe it's because I just get the manure directly to the farm without keeping it a pit or sack. Honestly, I don't know if I'm the problem, but straight talking, I don't find it effective."
39,2022-09-27,56," **Interviewer**: I thought that in a community like this, agriculture extension workers teach you how to manage those things...."," **Interviewee**: They do tell us, but we have been listening to the same things for so long."
39,2022-09-27,57, **Interviewer**: What do they say?," **Interviewee**: That we should be digging pits, line the pit with plastic and then place manure in the pits and cover it for some time to decompose. We haven't tried to do this, because it's difficult and we don't manage to do it."
39,2022-09-27,58," **Interviewer**: (laughs) I hope this ""laziness"" did go into biogas as well?"," **Interviewee**: No way! With biogas they promised a lot of good thing, so I couldn't play with it. Eh, I was so committed to biogas. I wanted to be exemplary, and even when I was going to ask for manure, I was assuring the people that they would learn from me -- and they would see lights in my house - so I couldn\`t have afford to be seen as a failure."
39,2022-09-27,59," **Interviewer**: Okay. Moving on, you have told me that after digging the hole you were told to source manure and it was a lot of manure, but you have forgotten exactly how much it was. Where did you get water to start it up?", **Interviewee**: That time I was not connected to a piped water system so I got the water from that river. We have a river in the vicinity.
39,2022-09-27,60," **Interviewer**: Oh, it's within 100 meters. And, you have a piped water system now that is great."," **Interviewee**: Thanks, it is always on and off thought."
39,2022-09-27,61, **Interviewer**: How was it like getting all that water with you children?," **Interviewee**: It was tough because that time it was summer and the river had dried up. So, we got it from the stream there."
39,2022-09-27,62," **Interviewer**: Oh, some 200 meters away. So after feeding it that time, how long did it take to start up?"," **Interviewee**: They told me to wait for few weeks, if I'm not mistaken some days. After that period the digester bag got full and it showed that it had gas in it."
39,2022-09-27,63," **Interviewer**: On the day of commissioning, did the installers come?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they came because the bag wasn't fully assembled that time as the bag was still sealed, and we only covered the outlet and inlet pipe with plastic bag and rubber strips. So, on that day, they came with other pipes and the stove and assembled it. Then, they opened the stove and I heard a sound like air flowing. After that, they lit it and it produced fire."
39,2022-09-27,64, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commission?," **Interviewee**: On the day of commissioning, I was able to cook side dish of vegetables. And I was very happy because I was expecting that everything was going to run smooth and that they would be coming to follow up on us and in the process motivating us. The next day after sunrise, I cooked porridge for my little children as well. So, I can say I used it."
39,2022-09-27,65, **Interviewer**: Did you cook nsima on it?, **Interviewee**: I never cook nsima on it. It was only side dish.
39,2022-09-27,66, **Interviewer**: Which side dish?," **Interviewee**: Pigeon peas - And that day they came and found me cooking on firewood. So they asked me to take the pot of pigeon peas from firewood to biogas. Thus, I started cooking firewood and finished on biogas."
39,2022-09-27,67, **Interviewer**: Did you ever cook beans on it?, **Interviewee**: No
39,2022-09-27,68, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: It was because I thought the fire wasn't strong enough. But, one day I was able to warm water for children on it -- it's sad though I never used it for cooking."
39,2022-09-27,69, **Interviewer**: I want to have a clear picture of how it worked in its 7-day life. So could please explain to me how much cooking time you got in those 7 days.," **Interviewee**: Like I said, I only used it for 7 days and it wasn't like I was using it on the daily basis. Thus, in those 7 days, I used it for three or four days only, and that's the days I cooked porridge \[20 minutes\], side dish \[20 minutes\] and boiled water for bathing \[20 minutes\]. It did not work long because of the plastic that got broken at the gas valve. I believe they knew that part had a problem before because it looked like it was broken from the very start. And, I believe that's why they told me to inform them if there was any problem. So when I noticed the problem I was fast to report and that's when they said they would come, but never did. And the problem escalated to the point it started leaking gas."
39,2022-09-27,70," **Interviewer**: So, in the whole 7 days, you didn't use it for more than 2 hours. What were the operation requirements?", **Interviewee**: It's basically what they told me in the beginning. They told me to feed it with manure and water to get the bag full. That was all.
39,2022-09-27,71," **Interviewer**: How often did they told you to feed it, and in what quantities?"," **Interviewee**: No, I shouldn't lie that they told me that. On the first day, they only advised me on feedstock preparation. But, it's been long, so I can't remember what exactly they told me. I can only remember that, I did what they asked me to do."
39,2022-09-27,72," **Interviewer**: After feeding it the first time, did you feed it again?"," **Interviewee**: I fed it because the bag wasn't to the level that they told me. And, when I fed the digester bag again, it got full to the level they talked about."
39,2022-09-27,73, **Interviewer**: Do you remember how much feedstock did you feed it with?," **Interviewee**: No, I don\'t remember, it's been a very long time."
39,2022-09-27,74," **Interviewer**: After feeding it the first time to start it up, how many other times did you feed it?"," **Interviewee**: On the day of starting it up, we did put water first before the manure. After pouring water, they demonstrated to me how to handle, and I did as they demonstrated. Then, I was told to do the same whenever I was feeding it."
39,2022-09-27,75," **Interviewer**: so, how much water and manure were you supposed to feed the digester with?"," **Interviewee**: Mmh, I don\'t remember."
39,2022-09-27,76, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: First, I was going to the goat house to collect fresh manure with no trash. Then I was placing manure in the bucket, add water and then mix it. Not all manure was broken down because goat manure I was collecting was also contaminated with dry manure. So no matter how I tried, lumps or full goat manure was always mixed with the slurry. Then, after mixing for some time, I was pouring the slurry into the digester."
39,2022-09-27,77, **Interviewer**: Did you have a mixer or a stick for mixing it?," **Interviewee**: I was using my hands, but I was covering them with a plastic bag. I never used a stir or stick!"
39,2022-09-27,78, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: It was me together with my children. And, it was them who were going around asking for manure from people's houses."
39,2022-09-27,79, **Interviewer**: What were maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: They simply advised us to inform them on any malfunction. So when it malfunctioned the first time I called them and they told him they would come. But, when I called the second time to follow up I was told that it was wrong number."
39,2022-09-27,80, **Interviewer**: The same number?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, the same number."
39,2022-09-27,81, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to call them after it malfunctioned?," **Interviewee**: When it malfunctioned, I tried to call them instantly because I didn't want to the digester bag to collapse completely. That's when they said they would come. And when I called them about a week or two again, it's when the responder told me that it was a wrong number."
39,2022-09-27,82," **Interviewer**: You said you didn't cook nsima on it because you were simply easy on it. Why were you easy on it? Why didn't you use it for cooking nsima, beans and all that?"," **Interviewee**: I simply underestimated and belittled the flames. I don't think if I could have put a pot of nsima or beans it wouldn't have gotten cooked. I just had a perception that the bag wasn't full enough, but it was still somewhat full."
39,2022-09-27,83, **Interviewer**: Did you differentiate that the taste of porridge cooked on biogas and on firewood?," **Interviewee**: No, it was the same."
39,2022-09-27,84, **Interviewer**: What challenges were there?," **Interviewee**: Eh, there were so many challenges. The first challenge was that they lied to me despite all my efforts, and it's what disappoints me most; it was like I worked for nothing. I was also hurt a lot when the people I told would learn biogas from me asking me to take out the digester bag. It hurt. It hurt because that was not we agreed upon. And, I was very saddened about the whole thing.... It was fraud! The installers promised they would be following up -- they were speaking English throughout and thought I wasn\'t picking what they were saying. I remember one time they mentioned that I shouldn't be taken for training because I was too old, and I asked them if they had asked me to do something and I didn't, or if I didn't do anything as they say. They said I did everything perfectly, so I told them I'm not old and I still have the energy to do it. So, I found it disrespectful for them to say I was old when I did things correctly and with commitment, while other people volunteered that they could not make it.... And I have to tell you, I felt in my heart that the people weren't honest by the way they conducted themselves when they were here."
39,2022-09-27,85, **Interviewer**: So they didn\'t convince you that they were here to install the digester so that you could use...," **Interviewee**: They didn't convince me whatsoever. They were just obsessed with taking pictures. And, the last time they came here I asked them how they were going to help me revamp the digester. They only said they would come back to fix it, and since then they never came back. However, eight people came last year to access the digester as well. They found the bag completely collapsed, but it was funny because people thought they were here for corona."
39,2022-09-27,86, **Interviewer**: Did you try to fix it?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn\'t. I couldn't have fixed it because I knew nothing about it."
39,2022-09-27,87," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. Let's talk about the people you were getting manure from. You said you got manure from them because you wanted them to learn from you about biogas. How did they react when they saw that it didn't work? How did people reach?"," **Interviewee**: I worked very hard to attract people and to make the digester work. And I was even challenging them that my digester would work, and people believed because of my efforts and commitment. So, when it didn't work, some people degraded my efforts. Some people were saying I'm a failure and that I had been cheated -- and, I totally agree with them that I was fooled."
39,2022-09-27,88," **Interviewer**: If some installers come to install the digester, would you accept them?"," **Interviewee**: I would like to have a digester because my heart is still in it. I have been telling all the people who have been coming here that I still want it and to prove to people that I can manage it. Of course, some people may think I'm old but I still have family who can be helping me to manage it. So, I would like to own a digester again because I would like people to learn about biogas from me."
39,2022-09-27,89," **Interviewer**: You don't look old to me. And, you look strong. How old are you?", **Interviewee**: I\`m 59 years old.
39,2022-09-27,90," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you receive something like this?", **Interviewee**: No
39,2022-09-27,91, **Interviewer**: What do you think of this information and do think it would have helped in your case," **Interviewee**: Yes, it would have helped a lot as the information could have served as a reminder and could have also guided me in resolving issues. And, it was better than giving me their numbers and later ignoring me when I called them. Of course, I can't say I could have solved all the problems, but at least I would have managed to fix some of the issues by myself."
39,2022-09-27,92, **Interviewer**: Why do you think you couldn't have managed to solve all problems with all that rich information?," **Interviewee**: It's because I don\'t know if they could have left as spare parts. I mean, we go to technicians to fix our things because they have spare parts. So, the success of that information would have depended on the availability of spare parts because it\'s not only about knowing the problems, but also having the spare solve the problem."
39,2022-09-27,93," **Interviewer**: Let's suppose the installers call you today and ask you to describe the current state of your digester, what would you say?"," **Interviewee**: I can tell them it\'s not working. And, let's be honest, the digester is dead. I don't think it can work again because the bag was cut to take it out the manure and it had lots of them. I remember we hired about five people to take it out and it took them 2 days to finish everything. And, if I have a chance to talk to them, I can ask them how a thing that was left in 2017 without any follow-up would survive without a technician. That's what I can say. It may seem that I'm being rude to them, but I\`ll just be reacting to the way they handled the whole thing."
39,2022-09-27,94," **Interviewer**: I understand, you earn respect."," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) Yeah, it was a marriage without an engagement -- it just ends anyhow!"
39,2022-09-27,95, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay the people who took it out?," **Interviewee**: I don't remember how much we paid them, but certainly we paid them a hefty amount because you can\`t do all that work for peanuts."
39,2022-09-27,96, **Interviewer**: What did you do with the manure?, **Interviewee**: Nothing. We just buried it in the ground as we left it in the pit.
39,2022-09-27,97," **Interviewer**: Taking all things into consideration, how did it reach this state? And, what caused it?"," **Interviewee**: It didn't work out because they left me in the dark and didn't stick to their promises. But, if everything was done according to plan, I could have told you what exactly went wrong. I can't say I'm the cause of its failure because it didn't reach a level where I assumed responsibility. It was still in their hands, so it's the people on top that failed and caused the digester to fail as well."
39,2022-09-27,98," **Interviewer**: How did you meet you energy now that this is not working? Do you still use firewood and dry pigeon peas plants, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's what I have already said; dry pigeon peas plants, firewood and maize cobs."
39,2022-09-27,99, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us anything about that. They were only coming here to take pics and then go.
39,2022-09-27,100, **Interviewer**: (laughs) did you sign any paper?, **Interviewee**: I didn't sign any paper.
39,2022-09-27,101, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: I didn't contribute anything except for the money I spent when we were starting it up, and removing the bag."
39,2022-09-27,102, **Interviewer**: Was there any masonry work involved?, **Interviewee**: No
39,2022-09-27,103, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: I don\'t know, as they didn't tell me directly where it came from. But, I heard them saying that it was from Japan or China. It was a lot of items that were involved. We had the pipes, the stove and the bag. And, I used my own money to collect the digester bag and pipes at the agriculture office, and that was the first money I spent on it. When, I came here to dig the hole, I found the ground too hard and compact as it was in the dry season, and that's why I hired people to do it for me."
39,2022-09-27,104," **Interviewer**: Oh, did you collect the items by yourself at the agriculture office?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I remember I went with Chief \[name redacted\] to collect the items by ourselves at the agriculture. When we went there we found two other people, so if Chief \[name redacted\] say he didn't find everything there, it could be true as there was no order in the way we got the things."
39,2022-09-27,105," **Interviewer**: You were so committed, uh?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was and it's sad it didn't work out."
39,2022-09-27,106," **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. We have about three questions to wrap up. What was the biggest difference in your life in that week you had it, if there is any?"," **Interviewee**: It was just the beginning of a new era and I feel saddened that it didn't go further. I'm sure if it could have continued, cooking would have been simple."
39,2022-09-27,107, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of Biogas?, **Interviewee**: I still have the desire to own it one day because I didn't reach I wanted. I want one day to use it for cooking and lighting as they explained.
39,2022-09-27,108," **Interviewer**: So, you still have interest in it, and you wish to use it again for cooking and lighting."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that's my wish."
39,2022-09-27,109, **Interviewer**: What the future of biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: I have questions about its practicability because I have had two conflicting experiences. The first experience is what happened with the biogas that was installed here. From that experience, I have serious doubts about its future. I see no future by the way thing panned out here. The second experience is what happened last year. I didn't understand why they came to ask me the question after all these years, so it got me thinking that it may be revamped again in the future."
39,2022-09-27,110," **Interviewer**: Final question, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I don't have any intervention in my mind. But, whatever it is it shouldn't be tough to start up like a digester in terms of the first digging and feedstock preparation -- it was not easy to start it up! It's a lot of work!"
39,2022-09-27,111," **Interviewer**: Before I wrap up, do you have anything to say?"," **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming and I have learned a lot from this conversation. I didn't expect us to talk this way. It's been great. However, if you noted the time you called me to inform me about your visit, I wasn't keen talking about biogas because the last people who came here seemed like they wanted to help me, but ended up tricking me. But, when you said you would come in person it changed my whole thinking. So, thanks again for coming for this talk."
39,2022-09-27,112, **Interviewer**: Thanks for welcoming me as well. Thanks a lot!,NA
40,2022-09-27,1,"Thanks for granting us the interview. I understand that \[name redacted\] is at Machinga hospital and it looks like he will be there for time. I understand he sustained serious injuries in the accident. So, we wish him well. Nonetheless, when I was coming, I didn't know that he had been in hospital all this time. When I called him today, he has communicated that I should talk to you, because you know everything about the digester too. So, I hope you know a lot about it. Luckily enough, we have his son here, so you will be helping each other. First question, where did the digester originate from?",I do not know where it came from.
40,2022-09-27,2, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: I am not sure, but I think it's a non-government organization and not the government because the people who came are not government officials from this community."
40,2022-09-27,3, **Interviewer**: When was it built?, **Interviewee**: It was 4 years ago
40,2022-09-27,4, **Interviewer**: Who built it? How many people came to install it?, **Interviewee**: One man built it from the installation company. He came a few times on a motorbike.
40,2022-09-27,5, **Interviewer**: How many of you built it?," **Interviewee**: Eh, we were many, more than 10."
40,2022-09-27,6, **Interviewer**: What was your role?," **Interviewee**: We were responsible for mobilizing animal manure and water. Every individual out of the 10 people contributed animal manure. Then, the installer advised us to make feedstock for the digester."
40,2022-09-27,7," **Interviewer**: Why did 10 people take part in the process? I mean, did you hire them or something?"," **Interviewee**: People were attracted to take part in the building process because the installers mentioned that the digester would be producing fertilizer. So, a number of people who wanted fertilizer contributed raw manure and took part in the installation process."
40,2022-09-27,8," **Interviewer**: Oh, how did those 10 people come together?"," **Interviewee**: The bona fide beneficiary, \[name redacted\], mobilized people who had manure, because he saw that he could not manage to feed it alone with the manure he had."
40,2022-09-27,9, **Interviewer**: Who is \[name redacted\] to you?," **Interviewee**: Yes, he is my neighbor and my subject as well. I'm a senior and I rule over 16 chiefs in this area. All those mountains, all this area is under my control."
40,2022-09-27,10," **Interviewer**: Okay, how was he selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: He wasn't chosen because he is related to me, no. He's not blood relative. Moreover, even though I'm a senior chief, I wasn\'t responsible for choosing the beneficiaries. The beneficiary were chosen at Traditional Authority (T/A) Nsanama court by Village Development Committees (VDCs). So, that's what I know, and even if he were here, he would have said the same thing."
40,2022-09-27,11, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't know anything about biogas. Plus, I didn't go to school, so I had no chance of learning about it."
40,2022-09-27,12, **Interviewer**: So you become aware of it when it came here?," **Interviewee**: When the digester came, I was in there. Moreover, I remember the installer said it needed something like a pump to make it produce gas for cooking and fertilizer from animal manure."
40,2022-09-27,13, **Interviewer**: What type of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: He didn't receive any training at all. The digester was simply installed there, and he waited for the installers to come bring a pump, but they never came. He waited for a very long time to the extent in that termites started eating the bag. Then, he moved to another house, and then thieves stole the bag. But, it took years for this to happen."
40,2022-09-27,14, **Interviewer**: So the bag was stolen?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, after he moved, the bag was just staying there, as he would not have moved with it because it was very heavy. So, after it was abandoned there, it was easy for thieves to take it out. He reported to me as a chief that the digester bag was stolen. I think it was a week after he moved. So, I went together to see what happened."
40,2022-09-27,15, **Interviewer**: Why would someone steal a digester bag?," **Interviewee**: Maybe the thief wanted to use it as a sleeping mat, what else could you do with it? (laughs)"
40,2022-09-27,16, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) yeah," **Interviewee**: Or, maybe he wanted to use it as mat, so that people could seat on it as we have done here. As for other things, like the pipes and the stove, they still have them in their house as his child has said. I remember I light a butt of cigarette on the stove. It kind of worked, but the installers never followed it up, and that's why they never managed to cook on it."
40,2022-09-27,17, **Interviewer**: Not even once?," **Interviewee**: He never cooked on it even once, because it was not fully rolled out. They were told to wait for a pumping machine, so that it could produce strong fire for cooking. And, they told us that once the pumping machine comes, then we would be able to get manure from it... As far as cooking, the fire I saw wasn't sufficient to cook on. It was only enough to light a butt of cigarette... I was there throughout the whole time as I was called to witness everything as a chief for this community. The fire I saw wasn't strong enough to cook anything on. But, the bag was full at that time, though it didn't produce gas."
40,2022-09-27,18, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs that time?," **Interviewee**: We get firewood from the trees around, and I make charcoal from mango trees myself because I have many mango trees around. As you can see there, I did cut that branch because I wanted to make charcoal. But, people don't usually use charcoal. I use charcoal because I have many trees. The trees you are seeing around are mine. In regards to firewood, I have three energy efficient wood stoves."
40,2022-09-27,19, **Interviewer**: Where did you get them?," **Interviewee**: A certain non-government organization brought it here, so that we could save trees. \[Come let me show you the stoves\]"
40,2022-09-27,20," **Interviewer**: Okay, thanks. How and why do you have many trees?"," **Interviewee**: I see that the environment is degrading, so I want to take it back. And, it's good for me in the short term because I use it for cooking, and it also shields my house from strong winds."
40,2022-09-27,21," **Interviewer**: When they brought the digester, I believe you had cows."," **Interviewee**: Yes, that time we had cattle, but right now, we don't have."
40,2022-09-27,22," **Interviewer**: How many cows did you have, and what happened?"," **Interviewee**: We had more than 20 cows, and people stole all of them in a single day."
40,2022-09-27,23," **Interviewer**: Oh, really?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it happened."
40,2022-09-27,24," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's too much, what did you do?", **Interviewee**: We didn't even bother to go to tradition doctor. We just left it in God's hands.
40,2022-09-27,25," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did you manage the feedstock before the intervention?", **Interviewee**: We had nothing to do with it.
40,2022-09-27,26, **Interviewer**: So with all that manure you weren\'t using it as fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it does not help. I have it tried you manure as fertilizer before and it does not work."
40,2022-09-27,27, **Interviewer**: How does maize react to manure?," **Interviewee**: If you don't use inorganic fertilizer, you should expect nothing but hunger. I have even tried chicken manure, and it doesn't work too."
40,2022-09-27,28, **Interviewer**: Don't agriculture officers come here to teach you how to make animal manure as fertilizer?, **Interviewee**: Nowadays they are always in their offices and not in the fields. I don\'t see agriculture extension workers here anymore (laughs)
40,2022-09-27,29, **Interviewer**: (laughs) they are always in their offices....," **Interviewee**: (laughs) they are always at Nsanama Office. I don't see them here to advise people on agriculture things. In the past, and when I say in the past I mean in the 90s or 80s, agriculture extension worker as used to come here to tell us that we should apply fertilizer 10 days after sowing, and then apply UREA fertilizer 61 days after sowing -- but these days you can't see them. So, we only do things the old way here, and it doesn't work as things have changed."
40,2022-09-27,30," **Interviewer**: Okay, how much feedstock did you start it with?"," **Interviewee**: We used 10 bags of cow and goat manure of which five bags were from our animal house. The other we got from other people. Then, we were advised to grinding goat manure in a mortar, before pouring the feedstock in the digester bag."
40,2022-09-27,31, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add?, **Interviewee**: We got it from the borehole.
40,2022-09-27,32, **Interviewer**: It's there!, **Interviewee**: 100 meters.
40,2022-09-27,33, **Interviewer**: Even less; maybe 50 meters., **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
40,2022-09-27,34, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up?," **Interviewee**: I think it took about a month. During that time, I have to say the installers were coming time and again, and we had hope that things would work out. But, after installation and seeing that it wasn't producing sufficient fire, they never came again. Before leaving, the installers just said they were going to bring a certain pumping equipment to boost the fire, and it's been 4 years now without bringing the equipment."
40,2022-09-27,35, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning? Did you see fire?," **Interviewee**: Of course, we saw fire."
40,2022-09-27,36, **Interviewer**: Did you try to cook?," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't, and we didn't even try because the fire was very, very little. And, that's when they said they were not done, and would come back later with a pump.... Oh, the fire was very little, only sufficient enough to light a cigarette (laughs)"
40,2022-09-27,37, **Interviewer**: (laughs) that's interesting!, **Interviewee**: (laughs) \[Lights up a cigarette\] Can you cook with this? (Laughs)
40,2022-09-27,38, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) No way! How many people were expected to use the gas?, **Interviewee**: Three people.
40,2022-09-27,39, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: Initially, they told us feed it with animal manure and water. Then, after it failed to produce gas, they said it needs a pumping device to help pump gas to the stove."
40,2022-09-27,40," **Interviewer**: Where did they say they were going to get the pumping devices? And, when did they say they would bring them to you?", **Interviewee**: They didn't tell about all that. They simply told us that they were going to bring a pumping machine to make the digester work.
40,2022-09-27,41," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you feed it after commissioning?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, a couple of times. It would have lost all the gas**,** if we had stopped feeding it. And every time we fed the digester, the bag was inflating. And, when it was full, it produced the little fire after switching it."
40,2022-09-27,42, **Interviewer**: Why would you still feed it when you knew it was not producing fire?, **Interviewee**: We continued feeding it because they told us that they were going to come back with a pumping device.
40,2022-09-27,43, **Interviewer**: How often did you feed it?, **Interviewee**: Once in a week.
40,2022-09-27,44, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock were you feeding it with?, **Interviewee**: We used to feed it with three bags (50 kgs) of manure.
40,2022-09-27,45, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add?," **Interviewee**: I don't really remember, but it was a lot because five women were coming to assist in collecting water for feeding it."
40,2022-09-27,46, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: It was the group - the 10 people group.
40,2022-09-27,47, **Interviewer**: Was this digester given to a person or a group?," **Interviewee**: It was given to a person but some people were helping just to get manure at the end of it. Also, it was hard for one person to prepare manure, so that's why some women were part of a group to help in grinding the manure. I don't think one person could have done the work that was involved. I just don't think so! So, they created like a club, and they had a specific day of feeding it. On that day, a person wouldn't come near the site because the smell of manure was just too much. The people were committed because the price of fertilizer is just too much, so it was an alternative to them."
40,2022-09-27,48, **Interviewer**: What were operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: They just left their numbers for us to call whenever there was a problem. But when we tried to call them, their numbers couldn't be reached."
40,2022-09-27,49, **Interviewer**: Do you remember how many times you feed it after it was commissioned?, **Interviewee**: It was countless times that you couldn't keep it in the head.
40,2022-09-27,50, **Interviewer**: Like 10 or 20 times?, **Interviewee**: More than that. I mean they fed it for 3 years. Imagine!
40,2022-09-27,51, **Interviewer**: Oh?, **Interviewee**: The people working did put in a lot of effort. It's just unfortunate that it didn't work.
40,2022-09-27,52," **Interviewer**: So during that time, where people able to collect digestate and use it in their farms?", **Interviewee**: It was producing something like liquid.
40,2022-09-27,53, **Interviewer**: What were the people doing that?, **Interviewee**: They were doing nothing with it because they were not told how to handle it; nobody ever used it as fertilizer in his or her farm.
40,2022-09-27,54, **Interviewer**: That's also fertilizer," **Interviewee**: People didn\'t know about that. They were only expecting waiting for the installer to come with the pumping device. And, there was no harm in that because it's what they were told. It's as if someone asking you to bring a lighter to light a cigarette, under the person brings a cup of water, will smoke the cigarette? They never got fertilizer out of it because the instructor did not advise them on what to do. For example, you are telling me that the liquid that was coming out could have been used as fertilizer, but the people were never told that. The problem is that they never went for training and the digester needs training to work."
40,2022-09-27,55, **Interviewer**: Did the people tried to call the installers....," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they tried to call the installers, but their phones couldn't be reached."
40,2022-09-27,56," **Interviewer**: So, in the end people never got what they wanted, for example, energy for cooking and fertilizer."," **Interviewee**: Mmh, they never cooked on it. Not even once. Maybe, they just used it as fire for igniting firewood like a matchstick."
40,2022-09-27,57," **Interviewer**: How did the people react to seeing 10 people feeding it daily, but not getting something out?"," **Interviewee**: I'm sure people were gossip about them, but I can't say I heard anyone doing that. But I'm sure people were talking behind them back for what had happen."
40,2022-09-27,58, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?, **Interviewee**: The people were handling large volume of manure so it was cause cough and flu.
40,2022-09-27,59, **Interviewer**: What else?," **Interviewee**: That's all I can think of....Imagine, people would not pass close to them when they were making feedstock, so how bad was it for the person who was actually making the manure."
40,2022-09-27,60," **Interviewer**: It must be very bad. How long did it take to stop making gas? Or, how long did the people take to give up?", **Interviewee**: Like I said 3 years.
40,2022-09-27,61," **Interviewer**: Let me get you clean on this one. When it was commissioned, you have said it didn't produce gas and it was not used for cooking not even once. So, the people were waiting for the installers to come with a pump so that they could use it for cooking as well as for fertilizer. Do you mean people would still feed it for a year, let alone for 3 years when it's not producing anything?"," **Interviewee**: Yes. The people here wanted it to work, and you cannot compare the effort that the people here put to the effort that the people of \[location redacted\] put. The people here were committed!"
40,2022-09-27,62," **Interviewer**: Oh, you mean people fed it for more than 2 years whilst it wasn't producing anything?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, after 3 years that's when the people say it was enough. You cannot wait for four years to get something in this life. It's just too much. Life these days is short. Two weeks ago, I was in Msasa village talking to a certain person there. In the evening, I received news that the person had passed on. Life is too short now; you can't wait for more than 3 years."
40,2022-09-27,63, **Interviewer**: You said when you called them their number couldn't be reached? Did you copy the numbers wrongly? What happened?," **Interviewee**: It was fraud. The installers only came here to cheat people. The same reason why they were not bringing the pump is the same reason why they were not responding to the calls... They only came here to cheat people and it was easy for them to do that because the people here are illiterate, and that\`s why we just accept and applaud everything!"
40,2022-09-27,64, **Interviewer**: (laughs) Oh," **Interviewee**: The fact that we had no lawyers, and that we didn't have the money to hire lawyers is why we did not go to sue for what they did. You know, you can't get a lawyer with K2000."
40,2022-09-27,65," **Interviewer**: If you had money and resources, would you have gone to court?", **Interviewee**: With 100% certainty! It\'s just awful! You can't make people work with manure for years like that for nothing. That's inhumane! There is no morality in that.
40,2022-09-27,66, **Interviewer**: You are a senior chief and you even get your monthly dues from the government. Why didn't you go there? Why didn't you involve the government?," **Interviewee**: You can't go to any public office in Malawi without money and expect to be successful. I remember me nephew was involved in an accident, so I called the ombudsman's office and even Counsel \[name redacted\] to help me. But, they were only lying to me. That's when I lost faith in the system."
40,2022-09-27,67," **Interviewer**: Oh, you talked with \[name redacted\], the former attorney general?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I even have the papers in my house I can show you. I got in debt because I borrowed money to follow the case. I remember this other time I exhausted all the money while I was in Blantyre, and he even gave me transport to come here. We went to court in Blantyre, but nothing happened. The person who hit my nephew corrupted the system. So, if an open and shut case like that failed to materialize what more this one -- it's just a waste of time for a poor to go to courts in Malawi. They just send you back and forth when you don't have money until you give up!"
40,2022-09-27,68," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Yeah, I see!", **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
40,2022-09-27,69, **Interviewer**: Have you seen this kind of information before?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't give them that."
40,2022-09-27,70," **Interviewer**: As you can see, it has information regarding issues that are common on digesters, their causes and solutions. What do you think about this kind of information, and do you think it would have helped?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, by just looking at the effort and commitment that the people were putting in, one would be inclined to think that it could have helped. And, it\`s unfortunate that they didn\'t give us any solid information about their whereabouts, so people couldn't have gone ""Agora or ADMARC"" and ask for them. People would have thought that the people were crazy."
40,2022-09-27,71," **Interviewer**: (laughs) If installers can call you today and ask you to discuss the current state of your digester, what would you say?"," **Interviewee**: We can tell them the truth that we left the digester in a secluded place after moving from one house to another, so some people stole the bag. And, it's not our thought that we left it there because waited for 4 years and they didn't show up. They moved from that house because the house had serious cracks, so it was safe. And, they couldn't have taken it out because they were not told how to take it out safely by removing the manure."
40,2022-09-27,72," **Interviewer**: So you think the people would not have a stolen it, if there were follow-ups?"," **Interviewee**: If the installers were organized and following up the digester, the thieves wouldn't have find a chance to steal it."
40,2022-09-27,73," **Interviewer**: Is that not a talk of a leader defending his subjects, even thieves? (Laughs)"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) No, if the installers were serious about the digester, it would not have been stolen. I mean, we waited for 4 years, not 4 months, and that's enough time for a baby to be born, and start life."
40,2022-09-27,74, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end. How much did the cost?, **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us that.
40,2022-09-27,75, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: No, we contributed nothing!"
40,2022-09-27,76, **Interviewer**: What about buckets and all that?," **Interviewee**: They contributed a flour mortar and pestle, a sieve for preparing feedstock."
40,2022-09-27,77, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) oh," **Interviewee**: That's why I say the people were committed, and were taken advantage of - that's what I mean. If they had money, they could have sued the installers for damages. Imagine, women were grinding and sieving goat manure to have smooth slurry, but all for nothing."
40,2022-09-27,78, **Interviewer**: (laughs) What kind of special items have to be important from another country?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, they didn't tell us."
40,2022-09-27,79," **Interviewer**: But, when you look at it do you think it's from Malawi?", **Interviewee**: We can't know. We just saw it coming it here.
40,2022-09-27,80, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Maybe, if you could tell us what you think of it, we can learn from you. But for us, eeish, we don't want that ""trouble"""
40,2022-09-27,81, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) oh!," **Interviewee**: Maybe others could accept it after being successful installed, because people don't normally shy away from projects here. But, with this one and with what people saw, I don't know! I don't think they can accept it. Generally, people embrace projects of any kind here!"
40,2022-09-27,82, **Interviewer**: Why do people embrace projects here?," **Interviewee**: It's because it\'s part of national development. And, every project has benefits; the people when they got the digester thought they would get fertilizer as well as use it for cooking."
40,2022-09-27,83," **Interviewer**: Last one. If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?", **Interviewee**: We could have gone for a solar system.
40,2022-09-27,84, **Interviewer**: Why a solar system?," **Interviewee**: It brings development in a community. It also brings change to a community. Also, solar system can also be used for lighting, which is a big plus. Here when we want to make our beds at night we light grass. That\`s not on... So, I can choose a solar system."
40,2022-09-27,85, **Interviewer**: Why don't you use candles?," **Interviewee**: What can we buy candle with? We don't have money, and with the food shortage, which is here, that's not a good idea. People are failing to buy food, so they can't buy candles. In the past week, I have only been eating pigeon peas day and night. It's tough! And, I have a plea to make to non-governmental organizations; please don't do development along the tarmac roads. People in remote are suffering. Please include us in your plans. NGOs don't come here! For example, we made bricks and asked the Arabs to build as a mosque here, but they didn't come. If you go to Nsanama, you will find mosques everywhere. So, I feel we are sidelined from development projects. We are only important around election period. After that, we are nothing."
40,2022-09-27,86," **Interviewer**: You are saying you are always sidelined in projects, then how come an NGO brought you a digester?", **Interviewee**: They brought nothing but diseases \[cough and flu\]
40,2022-09-27,87, **Interviewer**: (laughs) oh," **Interviewee**: What we are telling you is that, if you could come with a project, don't do what the biogas project installers did."
40,2022-09-27,88," **Interviewer**: Thanks, and that was my last question. Do you have any last words?"," **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming, and please know that you are welcome to come here anytime."
41,2022-09-28,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?, **Interviewee**: The digester came with the Agriculture Extension Officer from Nsanama EPA and his assistant.
41,2022-09-28,2, **Interviewer**: Who designed it?, **Interviewee**: I can say the government through the agriculture office.
41,2022-09-28,3, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: On that, I do not know because they did not explain to us where the funds came from."
41,2022-09-28,4, **Interviewer**: Who built it?," **Interviewee**: The digester was never fully installed; they just placed the bag in the hole and connected two white pipes. But, before that, I was advised to dig a hole, and then they came and said the hole was not as it was supposed to be. So, I made the adjustments to the hole while the Agriculture Extension Officer and his assistant was there. After that, I was advised to make feedstock for the digester, which I did. I do not know how much feedstock, I made, but they said it was not enough. They went back, and then the rains started and filled the digester."
41,2022-09-28,5, **Interviewer**: When was this?, **Interviewee**: I think it has been 6 years now.
41,2022-09-28,6," **Interviewer**: I mean, what month was it?"," **Interviewee**: It was mid December, I think. Therefore, I can say it came at the wrong time because it was the rainy season -- It came at a wrong time!"
41,2022-09-28,7, **Interviewer**: How many people built?," **Interviewee**: I dug the hole alone the first time, and the second time dug the hole while the Agriculture Extension Officer and his assistant was around."
41,2022-09-28,8, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came?, **Interviewee**: It was the Agriculture Extension Officer and his assistant only.
41,2022-09-28,9," **Interviewer**: So, the three of you built it?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
41,2022-09-28,10," **Interviewer**: Apart from digging, what was your other role?", **Interviewee**: I dug the hole and made feedstock. There were not many activities as the digester was in its infancy stage.
41,2022-09-28,11, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you prepare that time?," **Interviewee**: My son, I have forgotten, it has been long."
41,2022-09-28,12," **Interviewer**: (laughs) yeah, it has been wrong.", **Interviewee**: And it is even hard to remember when you did use the thing.
41,2022-09-28,13," **Interviewer**: Yeah, I see. We have so many people and households in this village. How were selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: I think they believed that when they installed the digester here, it would work and stay for a long time. Moreover, they saw that I am a hard worker."
41,2022-09-28,14, **Interviewer**: Are you a hard worker?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) Yes, I am."
41,2022-09-28,15, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?, **Interviewee**: I did not know anything about biogas. I become aware of biogas when I was called at TA court.
41,2022-09-28,16, **Interviewer**: Who was called there? Was it just chiefs or ordinary people too?," **Interviewee**: It was not just chiefs; ordinary people were there as well. The beneficiary were solely chosen by the people and Village Development Committees (VDCs) based on reputation of hard work and activeness. So, I was chosen and another man from Muheliwa Village was chosen."
41,2022-09-28,17, **Interviewer**: So people did not choose you because you are a chief?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) No, everybody knows I am a hard-working person here."
41,2022-09-28,18," **Interviewer**: Oh nice, even though you were chosen by the people you had the right to say no, why did you accept to build the digester?"," **Interviewee**: You cannot just keep cooking with maize stalks; it is just not on (laughs). That is a hard life. So, I was very happy, and I thought it was blessing too. Then, bad luck came and I did not enjoy the blessing! And, I do not like the way extension workers work these days, they seem to me so incompetent. I mean, they should have brought this in a summer where it could have worked. I am sure it would not have reached a state of being eaten by rats. Also, the extension workers were supposed to be here full time in the field. They should have been advising us on any matter regarding the digester and motivating us as well, and that could have been like a training too."
41,2022-09-28,19," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: I thought I was going to be free and healthier too. When the digester came, I was happy because I knew I was going to stop searching for firewood or maize stalks, so my body energy would not have been wasted on finding firewood. It is really tiresome to search for firewood."
41,2022-09-28,20, **Interviewer**: What did the installers tell you to expect it from this?," **Interviewee**: They just told me that a digester is used for cooking. They did not tell me anything apart from that. For example, they did not tell me how it works etc."
41,2022-09-28,21, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that you could use it for lighting?," **Interviewee**: No, they did not."
41,2022-09-28,22, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that you could use its byproduct as fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: No, they did not say anything like that. They just said that we could use it for cooking."
41,2022-09-28,23," **Interviewer**: Okay, what kind of training did you receive?"," **Interviewee**: No, I did not receive training."
41,2022-09-28,24, **Interviewer**: Not even on the day they came?, **Interviewee**: No.
41,2022-09-28,25," **Interviewer**: Then, how would you have managed to switch it on?"," **Interviewee**: After being selected as a beneficiary at the T/A courtyard, I received a phone call from Agriculture Extension Worker to go to Nsanama EPA to collect the equipment because they could not manage to bring it here because it was heavy. When I asked him when I should go there to collect the material, he told me to go right away. I told him I could not manage as I was in the field. Then they told me they would see what they could do. Moments later, he called me that they were coming to bring the equipment. Then they came with his equipment on a motorbike, and the way I saw it I would not have managed to carry it on my bicycle (laughs), no way. They tried to wrap it, but it was a lot, I could not have managed (laughs)."
41,2022-09-28,26, **Interviewer**: And it is also far.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I could not have managed. And, I even asked to them if they thought I could have managed to carry it, because it was heavy equipment, and they even did not manage to bring everything too, for example, the pipes."
41,2022-09-28,27, **Interviewer**: What else did they bring apart from the digester bag that time?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) it was heavy. They came two times that day. First, they came around 8 AM with the digester bag, and they went back to bring the pipes. So when they came the first time they told me that the bag would not fit into the hole, and they asked me to make it bigger."
41,2022-09-28,28," **Interviewer**: So after that, you made feedstock and placed it in the digester bag, then the rains started and filled the bag. So when they came to assemble the pipes and stove they found the bag filled with water..."," **Interviewee**: They said the water was too much, so it could not work. Then, they told us to wait for the bag to shrink, and that they would come at some point. From that time, they did not come after the rainy season or after summer, or after the next rainy season. They came after 3 years or so, but did not find me as I was at a funeral that time. So, I was just told that they came to assess the digester and found that the digester bag eaten by rats (laughs). They said they would come back, but since then they have never returned."
41,2022-09-28,29, **Interviewer**: So you did not reach a level where you could receive training?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we never receive the training of any sort. And, we do not even know that it produce fire!"
41,2022-09-28,30, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs that time?, **Interviewee**: We use firewood on energy efficient stove made of clay.
41,2022-09-28,31," **Interviewer**: Where did you get the manure? Was it all from you animal house? Or, you asked some from other people too?", **Interviewee**: I got it all from my cow house.
41,2022-09-28,32, **Interviewer**: How many bags did you use?," **Interviewee**: It was two bags, and after we started feeding it, that is when the rains started."
41,2022-09-28,33, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: Water is a problem here. We get water from that river there!
41,2022-09-28,34, **Interviewer**: That is like 600 or 700 meters. You don't have a borehole around?, **Interviewee**: We have but it's too far from here.
41,2022-09-28,35, **Interviewer**: So where do you get drink water?, **Interviewee**: We also get it from there; where else can we get water?
41,2022-09-28,36, **Interviewer**: I see. How did you manage your feedstock that time?," **Interviewee**: I use it in the farms. But, first, I heap it there to break down."
41,2022-09-28,37," **Interviewer**: Some say animal manure does not work as fertilizer, what is your take?"," **Interviewee**: That is a lie. When you use animal manure as fertilizer, you get strong maize. What I usually do is, I dig two small holes one either side of the maize, and put manure in the holes and cover. And, the maize I get there is huge. So, the trick is not to put it close to the maize as with inorganic fertilizer, because if you do that the maize wilts as the nutrients are excess."
41,2022-09-28,38," **Interviewer**: So, it is all about the application of the manure...do you have agriculture extension workers here?", **Interviewee**: No.
41,2022-09-28,39, **Interviewer**: So how did you figure that out?," **Interviewee**: We just use God's given wisdom. So we just think of how best we can use the manure and it works. At some point, I was applying manure directly to the maize and it was wilting. And, it is not easy use animal manure a fertilizer because it also attracts pests. It comes from the manure. So, when you use manure you know you will struggle with pests. (Laughs)"
41,2022-09-28,40, **Interviewer**: How did you deal with the pests?," **Interviewee**: When we have money, we buy pesticides. But, if we do not have, we just let it be."
41,2022-09-28,41," **Interviewer**: My next question was to ask how it worked after commissioning, but since it did not work at all, we will move on. What were the operation requirements?"," **Interviewee**: They just said it needs two things, animal manure and water."
41,2022-09-28,42," **Interviewer**: On the day you fed it to start it up, how did you prepare the feedstock? Did you have stir, mixer, or something?"," **Interviewee**: They did not talk about mixing. They only specified the quantity of manure and water to feed it with. Then, they told us that after feeding it, they would come to assemble it. They did tell us to mix the feedstock. I doubt their expertise, I wonder if he had gone for training themselves (laughs). They did not tell us to mix feedstock."
41,2022-09-28,43, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you how often you were supposed to feed it and in quantities?, **Interviewee**: They did not talk about feeding.
41,2022-09-28,44, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: Maybe if they had commissioned it, they would have told us things regarding maintenance. So, maybe if it had worked, then they would have told us about that. And the next set of people who came found it completely dead after been eaten by rats, so they could not have talked about maintenance too. But, they left their numbers and told my son that it was beyond repair. So, I just got the bag out of the hole because it was harboring a lot of rats -- it became a house of rats (laughs)"
41,2022-09-28,45," **Interviewer**: What did you do with the bag after you got it out? I have seen people using it for different purposes and all, what did you use it for?"," **Interviewee**: I should not lie to you because lying is a sin. After I got the bag out, I cut it and took it to the mosque, as there were no mats to use for praying. Maybe, this way it could turn out to be a blessing to the donors; I did not use it as roof."
41,2022-09-28,46," **Interviewer**: Let us talk about challenges, what challenges were there?", **Interviewee**: The problem was that the installers did not come as they promised so we did not see the benefits of biogas. That's was the only problem.
41,2022-09-28,47, **Interviewer**: Didn't the installers tell you that it does not work effectively in the rainy season or when there is no sun?, **Interviewee**: Then they would not have come in the rainy season -- they did not tell me that!
41,2022-09-28,48, **Interviewer**: Have you ever come across the Agriculture Extension Officer or his assistant?," **Interviewee**: No, and I do not think he is still at Nsanama."
41,2022-09-28,49, **Interviewer**: Did you have their numbers?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I had his number even before the biogas thing started.."
41,2022-09-28,50, **Interviewer**: Did you call him?, **Interviewee**: No.
41,2022-09-28,51, **Interviewer**: Why did you not try to call him?," **Interviewee**: I could not have called him when I saw that he had failed. There was no point of calling him. And, I knew that he would not come when he said he would come again at some point. I knew that was a mature and honorable way of saying we have failed, bye."
41,2022-09-28,52," **Interviewer**: Okay, we are in September 2022. Let us suppose The Agriculture Extension Officer or his assistant call you today to ask about the current state of your digester, what would you say? I mean, how would you describe the current state of your digester today?", **Interviewee**: I would tell him you know how you left; how many years has it been; and what do you expect? It is as you left it -- it\`s dead.
41,2022-09-28,53," **Interviewer**: How did it reach this stage? And in your opinion, what caused it to fail?", **Interviewee**: It is simple; they did not come after they installed it to make proper adjustments.
41,2022-09-28,54," **Interviewer**: Okay, why do you think they did not come?"," **Interviewee**: Like I said, I doubted their expertise. So, maybe they did not know how to fix it."
41,2022-09-28,55," **Interviewer**: Okay, how do you meet your energy needs now?", **Interviewee**: It is the same as in the past.
41,2022-09-28,56, **Interviewer**: What about charcoal?," **Interviewee**: No, we do not have trees for charcoal production. Also, we do not have the money to buy charcoal."
41,2022-09-28,57, **Interviewer**: Are you still using manure as fertilizer your farm?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
41,2022-09-28,58," **Interviewer**: I am sure when you cut the digester bag you found manure, what did you do with the manure?", **Interviewee**: It was completely eaten and some dead rats were also in there because of the heat (laughs)
41,2022-09-28,59, **Interviewer**: Did you use it as fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: No, it was not in a state where it could have been used as fertilizer. It was full of dead rats. So, we just threw it away."
41,2022-09-28,60," **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. Okay, how much did the reactor cost?", **Interviewee**: They did not reveal that to us.
41,2022-09-28,61," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you contribute anything in kind?", **Interviewee**: No.
41,2022-09-28,62, **Interviewer**: Your buckets?, **Interviewee**: No.
41,2022-09-28,63," **Interviewer**: Apart from digging and feeding it, what other activity did you do?", **Interviewee**: Nothing.
41,2022-09-28,64, **Interviewer**: You did not line the hole with a brick wall?, **Interviewee**: No.
41,2022-09-28,65, **Interviewer**: Did they talk anything regarding lining the wall?," **Interviewee**: No. They just told us to feed it, and that when we feed it the bag would inflate."
41,2022-09-28,66, **Interviewer**: What special items have to be imported from another country?, **Interviewee**: They did not reveal that to us too.
41,2022-09-28,67," **Interviewer**: We are the remaining with three questions, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: We still want it so that we can know its use. We did not see how it works, and how long it works."
41,2022-09-28,68," **Interviewer**: Okay, so you still want it?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
41,2022-09-28,69," **Interviewer**: Considering all that happened, do you think biogas has a future in Malawi?"," **Interviewee**: If we had used it, we would have known. But, it looks like it can help because it is easy to use and ignite. I do not like blowing air on fire to boost the fire. It is tedious. Women are struggling!"
41,2022-09-28,70," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, why were the installers not serious with the digesters?"," **Interviewee**: I do not know if it was jealousy or something. How could they just abandon it here when they knew that the donors had spent a lot of money on the digesters? They were supposed to follow it up and do anything to make it work, so that the donors could get their blessings. If you give something to someone to use, you gets blessings especially if the person uses the thing, because God is happy. So, I do not know if they \[installers\] are tired with their work, because if they are it is better that they should just quit."
41,2022-09-28,71," **Interviewer**: (laughs) If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: Eh, that is a difficult one. Of course, we have efficient stoves here, but I still think we need biogas because it is similar to electric stoves; it is easy to use, it helps save breath and it also keeps the eyes safe from smoke."
41,2022-09-28,72," **Interviewer**: That was my last question, in closing do you have anything to say?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, I just want to say I have the desire to own a digester again because the last time I did not see its benefits. So, I hope that one day I can see its benefits."
41,2022-09-28,73," **Interviewer**: A digester needs to be fed, for example, you with one bag of manure every day can you manage?"," **Interviewee**: If it keeps producing fire, then that is not a problem."
41,2022-09-28,74, **Interviewer**: Thanks for the interview.,NA
42,2022-09-29,1,Where did the digester originate from?,"The installers came with the clerk of the T/A. He simply told us that they had decided to install the digester at our house, so, I accepted them."
42,2022-09-29,2,Did they tell you were the installers were coming from? Which organization or government agency they were from?,"Ah, no. They just introduced themselves as a non-governmental organization, and they didn't say the name of the organization."
42,2022-09-29,3,Who built it?,"My children and I dug the hole. Initially, we dug the hole at mango tree, and then they asked us to dig at another hole close to the kitchen and to finish in three days, because they would come to install the digester bag. So, we dug the hole with vigor, and when the installers came they told us that it was okay. After that, they placed the digester bag inside the hole and connected two white pipes onto the bag. Then they told us to feed it with manure and they left saying they would come back to commission it. After that, I started feeding the bag with feedstock until I was exhausted, as it was not easy to gather manure from a certain village somewhat far from here. The manure I was getting from my animal house was not sufficient, so that\`s why I was sourcing manure there. Then, after some days, the bag got full while I was waiting for them to come, but they were not coming. Then, they came and found the bag shrunk, after I had fed it with the first charge. Still, they assembled the remaining parts like the two bottles, the stove, pipes, and then advised us to feed it again. They also showed us how to switch it on, if we got the bag was full. Since then I have never seen them again."
42,2022-09-29,4,How long has it been?,It has been 4 years now.
42,2022-09-29,5,How many people in total?,"We were four people. But, my brother and his four children too came to see what was happening, so they were helping too, though they were not there full time."
42,2022-09-29,6,How many people from the installation company came?,It was four people as well including the T/A\'s clerk.
42,2022-09-29,7,How many days did it take you to dig?,It two us four days; there days to dig the hole and one day to install the digester.
42,2022-09-29,8,How was it like to dig the hole? I can imagine that it was not easy to dig a hole for 3 days.,"It was hard work because the round hole that they advised us to dig was deep and huge. And, I found the hole very risky to children especially in the rainy season. I remember, whenever I went to the field I was worried about children failing into it... And, even after we got the bag out, there was always plenty of water in the hole."
42,2022-09-29,9,What was your role?,"We were asked to make bricks, and that they would bring cement, so that they could line the hole with a brick wall. But, sadly, the bag of cement never came, so they just placed the digester bag in an hole that was not lined. And, if I remember well, after a year or so, the soil or sides collapsed into that hole so the hole wider and became too dangerous for the kids. So, after we got the digester bag out, we were also responsible for covering the hole with soil Thus, when we covered it up and planted a guava tree on it. So, that guava tree is 2 years old or so."
42,2022-09-29,10,"You were told that they would bring cement to line it up hole but the next time they came, they didn't bring cement and line it up. What did you say to them? Or, what did they say about the bag cement and the whole arrangement when they came the second time?","Two different groups of people came. It's the first group of installers who told us about the cement. The second group just brought the digester bags, placed the bag and assembled the digester. So we couldn't have asked the second group about what the first group told us."
42,2022-09-29,11,We have so many people in this community and a lot of households. How were you selected as beneficiary?,"I don't know how I was exactly chosen. But, I think they chose me because I had livestock so they thought I could operate it. That time I had 25 pigs and goats. So, the clerk of the T/A Nsanama knew about it because he always moves around the communities to transact with chiefs. But, they told me they had chosen me together with other beneficiaries from Nsanama Village, Mulipa and 3 other villages. In this village, however, the only chose me."
42,2022-09-29,12,"So there was some sort of selection process, right? It wasn't hand picking?","Yeah, the T/A liaised with our chief to find one suitable person to get the digester here. So, our chief knew that we had many cattle, so he chose us. So, we can say we were chosen by our chief in collaboration with the clerk of the T/A."
42,2022-09-29,13,"You had a right to say no, why did you accept it to be built here?","I accepted it because it hurts me when I go around searching for firewood, which is scarce resource. So when they told me that with the digester I would be able to cook without firewood I had no choice but accepting it. So, after I accepted it and I had to buy cow manure from Mkwatamu Village, and then prepared feedstock with bare hands to feed the digester."
42,2022-09-29,14,"You are telling me you were chosen because you had livestock; 20 pigs, sheep and goats. Why didn't you use those to start up your digester? Why did you buy manure when you had livestock?","It's because when I made feedstock of pig manure it was coming out too hard. I wouldn\'t also use goat dung because it was also always also hard and dry, and they told us to use soft and fresh manure like cow manure. So, that's why I was buying cow dung to use it as feedstock."
42,2022-09-29,15,You mean you couldn't find fresh pig and mix with water to make feedstock that was not hard?,"It's a hard to find fresh pig dung because pigs are always moving about and it's rarely to find them in their animal house. So we were getting very little manure. Also, even when we gathered the dung, it's always dry to mix and have a suitable slurry. So, it was easy to make feedstock with cow dung, and that's why we preferred cow manure."
42,2022-09-29,16,"So why were you not just gathering the pig dung and soaking it in water for a day to soften it up, and then use it later?","Of course, I was doing that, but I was told that I needed to feed it every day with a bucket (20 liter) fresh manure, so that's why I was buying fresh cow dung everyday"
42,2022-09-29,17,Did you know about biogas before?,I didn't know anything about biogas because I had not own one before. I knew nothing about biogas.
42,2022-09-29,18,So you learned about it when the installers came with it here it?,Yeah
42,2022-09-29,19,What was your expectation about it?,"They told us that after getting the digester, we would be able to cooking with gas long as we feed it. With the fire, we would be able to cook everything and even boil water for bathing, and that's why I was attracted to it. And, I found it very interesting because my wife wouldn't be going around searching for firewood that is hard to source."
42,2022-09-29,20,"Okay, what else?","Hmm, no."
42,2022-09-29,21,What about using it for lighting?,"No, they didn\'t say that."
42,2022-09-29,22,What about using it as a fertilizer?,They did. They said once we started using it would be producing digestate at the outlet which can be used as fertilizer.
42,2022-09-29,23,What kind of training did you receive?,"We didn't receive any training, and they didn't tell us that we would go for training."
42,2022-09-29,24,"If you didn't receive any training, then how were you able to switch it on and off?","We never used it because it never produced gas. I mean, for it work it needed to gas in the bag, but once the bag shrunk we tried to feed it and it never got inflated. And once the installers left on that day, they have never returned."
42,2022-09-29,25," **Interviewer**: (laughs) I can imagine that they told you how to switch it on and off and how to make feedstock, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, they told us that. The taught us how to switch it on and off when the bag was full; they told us that day that the slurry which comes out of the outlet can be used as fertilizer. But, we did not switch it on because it had no gas after the bag shrunk."
42,2022-09-29,26," **Interviewer**: Oh, how did you meet your energy needs before the Intervention?", **Interviewee**: We only used. Firewood
42,2022-09-29,27, **Interviewer**: What about charcoal?," **Interviewee**: Charcoal is for the rich, my son. So we use firewood, and sometime we simply cut bluegum trees around."
42,2022-09-29,28," **Interviewer**: I can see that the use bluegum trees from within, and where do you take the other firewood?", **Interviewee**: We get it from our farming fields.
42,2022-09-29,29, **Interviewer**: Where are you farm?, **Interviewee**: It's somewhere far.
42,2022-09-29,30," **Interviewer**: If you leave 6:00 in the morning, what time do you return?"," **Interviewee**: Somewhere around 9 in the morning, it's not too far."
42,2022-09-29,31," **Interviewer**: You said that time you had pigs and, goats, do you still have the animals?"," **Interviewee**: No, the pigs got killed by African swine fever. As for the goats, we sold them all."
42,2022-09-29,32, **Interviewer**: How many goats did you had?," **Interviewee**: I had 10 goats, and I had 25 pigs and I was spending a lot of money on maize grain. I remember, I was buying K1200 a bag of maize grain, and the livestock was eating that in four days. I can't think of an animal that eats as a pig, around this time you to feed it, and you also feed it 3 other time, and if you don't feed them 4 or 5 times they would be following you around whenever you are carrying plates."
42,2022-09-29,33, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock i.e. goat and pig manure before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: I was gathering dung in a pit and store it for some time. Then, I was collecting and using it as fertilizer in my farm."
42,2022-09-29,34, **Interviewer**: Some people say those type of manure doesn't work. What's your take?," **Interviewee**: It depends on how you make it, and how you generally view it. Some people even say that inorganic fertilizer doesn't work, imagine. So as far as making the manure, I was putting the manure in a hole, cover it, and then add more manure and cover it again, so this way it works."
42,2022-09-29,35, **Interviewer**: Were you adding some other things to the manure?," **Interviewee**: We were adding a lot of thing, for example, maize grain and stocks, water etc. until we filled it up."
42,2022-09-29,36," **Interviewer**: Let's talk in detailin regards to commissioning of the digester. The first time you interacted with the installers was when they came with the clerk of the TA, and they ask to dig a hole. From that day how long did it take them to return with the bag?"," **Interviewee**: The first installers came and identified somewhere near the mango tree, and advised us to dig a hole for the digester and we did. Then, the next installers came and told us to dig somewhere else because they felt the shadow of the tree and it was not aligned well with the movement of the sun. They felt that in the afternoon the sun was going to be on the other side of the house, so it was going to be difficult to expose the digester to the sun. So, we dug the hole for two days, and after two months they came with digester bag a white pipes. I remember, that day they found me in the field that I had to be called by child. After I reached home, we started making feedstock and we feed the digester - I worked with my children to collect water to make feedstock, but it was a lot of water and a lot of work. After that, they came again 3 weeks or so with green pipes, a stove and other fittings. But, at that time the bag that which was full days prior to their visit was shrunk. So, they still assembled the digester and told us to feed it, and that when the bag was full we were supposed to switch it on. Unfortunately, it never got full and the installers too never came. We tried feeding it, but even though we were feeding it, the bag continued to shrink. ."
42,2022-09-29,37, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you use to start it up?," **Interviewee**: On the first day, we made feedstock of four bags (50 kg) of cow manure and 24 buckets (20 liters) of water. We got the manure by buying the bags from people from another village. I also recall that collecting water was not easy, even though I was supported it by my girls. So, when they came the next time, and they found that the bag was shrunk. Then, they asked us to feed it with 3 buckets (20 liters) of manure, which we got from our animals."
42,2022-09-29,38, **Interviewer**: What manure did you use from you animals?, **Interviewee**: Goat and pig manure.
42,2022-09-29,39," **Interviewer**: Okay, I get it. How much was a bag of manure?", **Interviewee**: We bought the bag at K300 each.
42,2022-09-29,40, **Interviewer**: How far from here did you get the manure?, **Interviewee**: It was far from here. It was taking me 30 minutes to 60 minutes to go back and forth on a bicycle.
42,2022-09-29,41, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: We got it from a borehole that side.
42,2022-09-29,42, **Interviewer**: How far is it from here?," **Interviewee**: Approximately, 1.5 kilometers."
42,2022-09-29,43, **Interviewer**: How many girls supported you in collecting water?, **Interviewee**: Four girls.
42,2022-09-29,44, **Interviewer**: When you were feeding the digesters were they installer present?," **Interviewee**: During the first time, they were there. But, the second time when we were trying to start it up, they only told us how much feedstock to feed it."
42,2022-09-29,45, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add the second time when you were trying to revamp it?, **Interviewee**: It was two buckets of water.
42,2022-09-29,46, **Interviewer**: So you started it up with 3 buckets of manure and 2 buckets of water?," **Interviewee**: Correct. And, the following morning the bag got full and I thought it would work, but when we returned from the farm we found bag shrunk."
42,2022-09-29,47," **Interviewer**: And, since you tried to revamp it, they have never come back?"," **Interviewee**: No, they never returned, and we had nowhere to turn to. And, when I met the TA clerk I asked him about the installers, and he just told me that the installers were ""Fake"" (laughs). And, he told me that in all the digester didn't work in the installed them, zero. They just wasted money and fuel for nothing. What hurts me most is that they asked me to make burned bricks, which was very involving. The made me burn bricks for nothing. I feel like the country is too much corrupt, and it's not declining."
42,2022-09-29,48," **Interviewer**: When you look at all this, why do you think the installers never came? Why would someone bring a digester bag, pipes and a stove, and then not follow up?"," **Interviewee**: We were baffled as well. We didn't know if they were occupied with other work, or if they had gone somewhere else to install the digesters. They left me the two cell phone numbers, but when I called them, they didn't reply. Then, I lost the numbers and stopped following up!"
42,2022-09-29,49," **Interviewer**: Did you ever see fire on it, even the littlest flame on it?"," **Interviewee**: We didn't see any type of fire or flame whatsoever. We didn't even dare to put a pot on the stove. What happened was that the bag was shrinking day by day from the first day we tried it with them. I mean, they asked us to light it up, but it didn't produce fire. Immediately after that they left. That was there habit, they weren't staying long as you have stayed here \[30 minutes\]. When they were leaving, they advised us to feed it again to revamp it, and try to switch in. But, the bag kept on shrinking and it never worked. Then, after sometime something started rotting and the area started stinking very much like dumpsite. People were even complaining and asking what was causing the odor when they were passing by."
42,2022-09-29,50, **Interviewer**: Did they teach you how to switch it on when they were leaving the last time?, **Interviewee**: They showed us how to switch on the stove. They told us that we need matchstick to light it up.
42,2022-09-29,51, **Interviewer**: How many other times did feed it after feeding it the second time when you tried to revamp it?, **Interviewee**: They told us to feed it with 10 bucket of manure everyday.
42,2022-09-29,52, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add?," **Interviewee**: 20 liters of water --But, even though we were feeding it nothing changed, it kept on deflating. I feel it reached this state because the installers were not closely monitoring thedigesters and us. And, we feel if the installershad come the time the bag was inflated, it could have worked -- and we could have seen fire."
42,2022-09-29,53, **Interviewer**:What were the operation requirements?, **Interviewee**: They told us that we were supposed to feed the digester with animal manure or food waste.
42,2022-09-29,54," **Interviewer**: and water, right?", **Interviewee**: Water too.
42,2022-09-29,55, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We were mixing the feedstock with water, and then we stir. After that, we used to get a cup and draw the feedstock from the bucket and pour into the digester bag via the inlet pipe. And , they gave us plastic sheet to cover the inlet and outlet pipes after feeding it."
42,2022-09-29,56, **Interviewer**: How did you handle the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We used to handle the manure with bare hands, as we weren't given any protective clothing. So, after handling it, I was washing my hands with you soap. I was doing this because I really wantesd to use it for cooking, and I didn't want my wife to stress about sourcing firewood."
42,2022-09-29,57," **Interviewer**: I asked you about, how many times did you feed after trying to revamp it? I think I didn't get a response, or if I got you response, it wasn't clear to me."," **Interviewee**: We tried to feed it everyday day for a very long time. It was quite a long time, uncountable."
42,2022-09-29,58, **Interviewer**: Maybe 2 weeks," **Interviewee**: I think we fed it for four consecutive weeks. We didn't miss it a day because we were so serious about starting it up. After feeding it for four weeks and seeing no changes, we lost hope and conceded that we had failed."
42,2022-09-29,59, **Interviewer**: Did it ever release digestate at the outlet?," **Interviewee**: No, it never did."
42,2022-09-29,60, **Interviewer**: How did you construct the digestate collection point?," **Interviewee**: We just dug the hole at the outlet, but it never released digestate as the bag never got full."
42,2022-09-29,61," **Interviewer**:You said was it stinking, how come? I thought you were closing the inlet and outlet pipes after feeding it."," **Interviewee**: After the rains started, the hole got filled with water to the extent that the bag was submersed in water. So, when the rains ended, things started rotting around the digester hole and it was producing a very bad odor, it was like a wastewater treatment plant. But, before it was wasn\`t producing any smell. I blame the installers for not coming when the bag got full. I'm sure if they had come that time, things would have worked out differently."
42,2022-09-29,62, **Interviewer**:What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: They left us their phone numbers, so that we could notify them on any issue, but the numbers couldn't be reached. We called, but they never responded. We tried both lines, airtel and tnm, but never got a response. So that a negative because we were forced to buy airtime at a time we didn't really want to buy airtime, and even had little money."
42,2022-09-29,63," **Interviewer**:So we can say the installers were responsible for maintenance, right?"," **Interviewee**: Maybe, because we don't know what the arrangement could have been after commissioning it."
42,2022-09-29,64," **Interviewer**: My next question was to ask you if it met your needs, but that can't be answered. Let's put it this way, what are you cooking needs?"," **Interviewee**: it's what everyone wants. Everyone wants to be able to cook when he wishes to cook, so we hoped for the same. It's just unfortunate that it did not work at all. After three years, the bag was about to be completely covered, so we just removed it. I just cut the digester, because I failed to carry it from the hole, as it was filled with feedstock."
42,2022-09-29,65," **Interviewer**: So, you didn't remove it to make a roof sheet as I've seen?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) No I removed it because it was being covered with soil. So, I cut it because I failed to carry it from the hole. And, it was coincidental that once I got it out, my kitchen roof started to leak, so I just made it a roof sheet."
42,2022-09-29,66," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were the challenges?"," **Interviewee**: The first problem was that when it rained the hole was filled with water, and it was a threat to the kids. The other thing was that the hole was getting wider and wider as its sides were collapsing into the hole. This was not supposed to happen though because they promised us cement and to line the hole. They even asked us to make bricks for that purpose, so we just burnt bricks for nothing. Another challenge was that it was not easy to carry of fresh manure - It was hard work. So, I worked for nothing, and I lost my money for nothing too."
42,2022-09-29,67, **Interviewer**: I thought you had a bicycle.," **Interviewee**: Yes, I have but I couldn't ride the bicycle while the bag was on, I was putting the bag of manure on the carrier, and then move by pushing the bicycle while walking."
42,2022-09-29,68, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this \[sheet of intervention\]?, **Interviewee**: No
42,2022-09-29,69, **Interviewer**: What do you think of this information and do you think it would have helped you?," **Interviewee**: The information would have helped because we could have known what was supposed to be done to rectify the problem. It's sad that in our case we didn't have such information as a result when the digester failed we were clueless. So,that's why we just cut it off as we did and use it as a roof and a mat."
42,2022-09-29,70," **Interviewer**:We are in September 2022. Let's suppose the installers call you and ask about the digester, what would you say?"," **Interviewee**: I would tell them that the digester is broken down and its parts are just dispersed. I would also tell them that the digester reached this stage because they didn't follow up for 6 years. If you saw the pipes and metal bars on where I showed you pipes and stove for the digester, that is equipment left by a certain organization that was constructing pit latrines for community. After they finished their work they asked me to keep the materials for them, but it has been two or three years now without returning to get their equipment too. I hope they will come one day too to get their things."
42,2022-09-29,71," **Interviewer**: We have talked at length and many issues have come up. I want to know, how did the digester reach this stage? And, in your opinion, what caused it?"," **Interviewee**: I think it reached this stage because we weren't trained, so we did not know what to do. Everything that was said was just too quick to follow and wasn\'t enough. But, I can't definitively say they or we are cause of its failure. Also, I feel like they took a lot of time to come, install and commission it, and that's why they found the bag shrunk. On top of this, there was communication break down between the installers and us. We failed to report to them the problem because they couldn't respond to our calls despite the fact that they gave us their numbers. All in all, I feel training was a key issue, and the behavior of the installers leave a lot to be desired. I feel like they were only coming here because they were told to do so by their boss -- they had no will and interest in the whole work. But, on our part, I feel like we committed ourselves and that's why we even went to a far place to buy cow manure and all that. You have found the digester bag cut and the pipes dispersed because the installers were not serious. You can't wait for 4 years. It's just too much. That time can't even work in marriage. You have seen people going to South Africa for 4 years in search of greener pastures. But, when they return the find their wives pregnant with other men -- Four years is a lot of time."
42,2022-09-29,72, **Interviewer**: How do you make your energy needs now?," **Interviewee**: We use firewood now. But, these days we use an energy efficient stove, which was brought by a certain NGO."
42,2022-09-29,73, **Interviewer**: Do you know their name?," **Interviewee**: No, here in village we just receive without really paying too much attention to the providers."
42,2022-09-29,74, **Interviewer**: Does energy stoves work?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it saves a lot wood."
42,2022-09-29,75, **Interviewer**: Do you know how much firewood do you use in a month?," **Interviewee**: Hmm, I don't know."
42,2022-09-29,76, **Interviewer**: We are moving towards the interview. How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us. The installers were not staying long to share that information. You have stayed two or three times more than they used to stay.
42,2022-09-29,77, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: We only spend money on cow manure. People were even surprised to see me buying cow manure. But, I had to buy it even I had animals just to make it work."
42,2022-09-29,78, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?, **Interviewee**: It must be from abroad. It can be from here.
42,2022-09-29,79, **Interviewer**: What makes you say so?," **Interviewee**: When I saw the digester bag, my thinking was that it is not from Malawi. The thing didn't Malawi like. Plus, I think they said the organization that brought the digesters was from abroad, so the digester had to be from abroad too."
42,2022-09-29,80, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of Biogas.," **Interviewee**: That time when I got it, I wanted biogas because I wanted it to solve my cooking problems. Right now, I don't know whether I will have it again or on. But, I still want it or something else for cooking \[cuts of by wife (do you still want Biogas? Not again)\]... It sad I didn't use it. If I had used it for four or five years, I wouldn't have had any problem with it. But, in this instance, it's bad and I only lost my money because of it. I lost my energy in digging and carry manure too."
42,2022-09-29,81," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own energy or waste intervention, would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I can think of energy efficient stoves, because it saves firewood."
42,2022-09-29,82," **Interviewer**: That was my last question, do you have any last words?"," **Interviewee**: I thank you a lot for coming here to ask me question. We didn't even think people know that we were beneficiaries. So, yeah, that's what happened with my biogas. Thanks."
42,2022-09-29,83, **Interviewer**: Thanks for welcoming me. I have learnt one or two things. Thanks.,NA
43,2022-09-29,1,Where did the digester originate from?,"I do not exactly know where the digester came from. I just know that the project came through the T/A\`s \[traditional Authority\] office to identify people who had goats or cows to benefit from the project. I think here in Nsanama they gave out 10 digesters to enable people to cook without firewood and in the process protect trees and the environment. So, I was one of the 10 individuals who were given the digester because I had cows. People who had animals where chosen because they did not want people to go around asking for manure or buying manure for its easy operation."
43,2022-09-29,2,Oh nice. Who funded it?,"As for me, I did not attend the meeting; I was just told that they were bringing a digester here because I met requirements."
43,2022-09-29,3,"So, you didn't go to the meeting, but the people chose you still?","Yeah, because the people knew that I had cows."
43,2022-09-29,4,How many cows did you have that time?,I had six cows
43,2022-09-29,5,"Oh, you had. Did you sell them?", **Interviewee**: My cows were stolen.
43,2022-09-29,6, **Interviewer**: All six?," **Interviewee**: They stole four cows and goats. After that, I decided to sell the remaining cows."
43,2022-09-29,7, **Interviewer**: What did you do? Did you go to tradition doctors?," **Interviewee**: I did not anything because the thieves who do this use black magic. So, you just waste time and resources doing that."
43,2022-09-29,8," **Interviewer**: That is true. Who built it? And, how many people came to build it?"," **Interviewee**: The people who built it were two, and they said they came from Mzuzu University. First, they did prepare feedstock and assemble the digester. After that, they stayed for long and came back after 2 months, if my memory serves me well. They stayed away for long that the bag got full and I even called them to ask if they would come back and finalize everything. They just told me that I should not worry, they would come, and indeed, they came. When they came they started it up, and they told me how to make feedstock and how to feed it."
43,2022-09-29,9, **Interviewer**: What was your role?," **Interviewee**: They advised us to dig a 1-meter deep hole and its diameter was also 1-meter. After that, they told us to collect six bags (50 kgs) of cow manure and we did. Then we also sourced one drum (200 liters) of water, which we add to the cow manure for feedstock preparation."
43,2022-09-29,10, **Interviewer**: Six bags of cow manure is a lot. Did you get all the manure from your cow house?," **Interviewee**: It was all from our cows. And, it was all fresh cow manure because that's what they advised us."
43,2022-09-29,11, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?," **Interviewee**: That time I did not have tap water here. So, I hired some women to collect water from the borehole."
43,2022-09-29,12, **Interviewer**: It must be a lot of money. How much did you pay for that?," **Interviewee**: I paid them K1500, I think,"
43,2022-09-29,13, **Interviewer**: When was this built?," **Interviewee**: It has been long, I do not remember."
43,2022-09-29,14, **Interviewer**: Did you hire people to dig the hole as well for you?, **Interviewee**: I dug the hole together with my child.
43,2022-09-29,15," **Interviewer**: Oh, you must have persevered."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we were committed because we wanted the digester so much."
43,2022-09-29,16," **Interviewer**: You have said you were chosen at a meeting which was held at the T/A's office. Could you explain to me, what the meeting was like, and how were people selected?"," **Interviewee**: Like I said, I was not there. But, I think it was a community meeting, because I do not think the chiefs know every person, who has cows in a community. So, I think people were also called to the meeting, and they chose amongst themselves with the supervision of community leaders."
43,2022-09-29,17," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you know about biogas before?"," **Interviewee**: I did not know about biogas before... But, I think, I heard about it in school. I didn't really understand it because it was just theory. If it were practical, I would have had a better understanding of it. I fully understood what biogas when it came here."
43,2022-09-29,18, **Interviewer**: Which level of school? Secondary or Primary school?, **Interviewee**: Secondary.
43,2022-09-29,19," **Interviewer**: Okay. Though you were chosen, I do feel like you could have denied it, if you wanted to. Why did you accept it to build it here?"," **Interviewee**: I accepted it because they explained that the digester is used for cooking. So, I found it very useful. And that time it was not easy to source firewood, and even when we got the firewood, we were only using it for a very short time. I also saw that it was easy to cook on biogas since everything is within and it's fast, and easy to ignite the fire on biogas. Again, I also considered the fact that the government advocating against cutting trees, so if the same government had brought the digesters as an alternative, then it was only fair to accept the digesters in order to conserve the environment. So, the introduction and adoption of the digesters in a community like this is helpful and needful to the environment."
43,2022-09-29,20," **Interviewer**: What were your expectations? I can see that you expected to use the digesters for cooking, and to help the government in its quest to protect the environment. Apart from these, what else did you expect?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I expected the digester to help me save time. When you use firewood, you waste a lot of time in searching for wood. For example, you can leave at 5:00 in the morning and the return at 2 or 3 PM. Thus, if you have biogas, you could use that time to do some other things."
43,2022-09-29,21, **Interviewer**: You don't look like someone who would go to search for fire...," **Interviewee**: No, no (laughs). What can we do when we do not have cooking appliances?"
43,2022-09-29,22," **Interviewer**: (laughs) No, I can tell when I see one..."," **Interviewee**: (laughs) I don't look like someone who would search for firewood? But, yeah, that time when the digesters came we used to go source firewood because the charcoal wasn't common here. And, that time we used to walk a very long distance, that we were resting 3 or 4 times along the way. It was tiresome - tedious!"
43,2022-09-29,23," **Interviewer**: Okay, what did the installers tell you to expect it from the digester?", **Interviewee**: They just told us about cooking.
43,2022-09-29,24, **Interviewer**: What about using it for lighting?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn\'t."
43,2022-09-29,25, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive from the installers?," **Interviewee**: We didn't receive any kind of special training. But, on the day of commissioning it, they told us a number of things. They told us that when the bag was full, we could drain it through the white outlet pipe. They told us how to switch it on and off. They also told us how to make feedstock, and that we were supposed to feed it every day with one bucket (20 liters) of cow manure and 20 liters of water. They also told us that we could feed it with food waste. And on top of that, they told us not to drop any hard thing, for example, a stone in the digester. So, if it was training, it was just what we were told on the day of commission."
43,2022-09-29,26, **Interviewer**: How prepared it to run or operator did you feel you were?," **Interviewee**: As a beginner, what they told me on the day of commission I thought was enough, and I didn't have any knowledge to say this was enough or not enough. So, what I was told that time I thought was enough, and I was confident that I could learn it."
43,2022-09-29,27," **Interviewer**: Okay, you have told me that you had six cows. How did you cow manure that time?", **Interviewee**: That time I was using cow manure as fertilizer in our fields.
43,2022-09-29,28," **Interviewer**: How did the manure work? Or, did you add any fertilizer?"," **Interviewee**: The soil here seems that it has lost its nutrients, so we add inorganic fertilizer to get strong maize we don't use the manure solely."
43,2022-09-29,29, **Interviewer**: You said you started it up with six bags (50 kg) of cow manure and 200 l of water. How long did it take to start up?," **Interviewee**: I think it was after 1 month and some weeks. Like I said, I called them around 2 months from the day they first came here. When they left it, they just closed it up at the outlet and inlet with plastic sheets. So, I think they came to commission after 2 months. And, in those two months, the bag was inflating little by little, and when it was sunny, it was getting full to the extent that we thought the bag would burst. And that's why I called them, and even though I called them, I was hesitant to make the call because I knew that they knew what they were doing."
43,2022-09-29,30," **Interviewer**: It takes mostly 2 weeks or so to commission it, so I think 2 months was a lot of time, I think. Did they tell you what took them so long?"," **Interviewee**: When I called them, they didn't tell me why they were not coming. So, I thought that gas production wasn't complete that time. They only told me not to worry and that they would come at some point."
43,2022-09-29,31, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: When they tried, it produced fire with no problem."
43,2022-09-29,32, **Interviewer**: Did you manage to cook on it?," **Interviewee**: After commissioning it, the next day we fed it... And we were able to warm water for bathing (15 - 25 minutes) and even cook side dish (30 minutes). But, the fire was not taking long to stop."
43,2022-09-29,33, **Interviewer**: Like how long was it taking to stop?," **Interviewee**: Maybe enough time to boil water (15 -- 25 minutes), but after that, the fire was coming very low and eventually it was dying."
43,2022-09-29,34," **Interviewer**: Where you able to cook breakfast, lunch and supper on it?", **Interviewee**: If you prepare the breakfast (10 -- 15 minutes) you had to wait for the sun to shine to cook side dish of vegetables (8 -- 15 minutes).
43,2022-09-29,35," **Interviewer**: So, you didn't use it in the evening? You never used it in evening?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, not once."
43,2022-09-29,36, **Interviewer**: How many people were living in your family the time?," **Interviewee**: Six people ... No, eight people!"
43,2022-09-29,37, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: It only required feeding with animal manure, food waste and water on a daily basis."
43,2022-09-29,38, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We were taking a 20-liter bucket of cow manure, add water, and then mix with hands until suitable slurry was made."
43,2022-09-29,39, **Interviewer**: Didn't it feel disgusting or gross to mix the feedstock with hands?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was doing that because there was no other alternative. But, I was wearing plastic bags to protect myself from pathogens. And, my children were murmuring about preparing feedstock all the times. They were not pleased at all to handle cow manure on a daily basis. They were always asking me if there was another alternative to prepare the feedstock. So, I was just encouraging them to persevere. I was also telling them that if they stopped feeding it, then it would fail and damage other people's property. So, we tried our best to feed it all the times."
43,2022-09-29,40," **Interviewer**: So, who was feeding it? The boys?", **Interviewee**: I was also supporting them.
43,2022-09-29,41, **Interviewer**: How many boys?, **Interviewee**: Two boys.
43,2022-09-29,42, **Interviewer**: You are only saying the boys had issues with feeding it. How did you feel yourself about feeding it?," **Interviewee**: It was a lot work. It was heavy. Feeding it daily wasn't ideal. It could have been better if they had advised us to feed it twice a week or once a week. Still, we had no option, but to do it because we felt like if we didn't feed the digester, it would stop break down."
43,2022-09-29,43, **Interviewer**: How long did you feed it?," **Interviewee**: To tell you the truth the digester didn't last very long. I can say I used it for 2 months. After it stopped, I called them, and then they just said they would inform the installers to come and fix it. And, they never came."
43,2022-09-29,44, **Interviewer**: Did you call again to follow up?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn\'t. After sometime, I don't know if they told you yesterday when you came, thieves came and damage it. And, I even report the issue to police. This happened around the same time they stole my cows, so I think it was same people. I think, they had come again to steal the remaining cow, but when there saw that, there was no cow they just damaged the bag out of anger."
43,2022-09-29,45," **Interviewer**: (laughs) yeah, it could be the same people... some people are evil. What were the maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: They did not tell us what to do in case of a failure. That's why when it malfunctioned I called the installers. And, when I called them, they didn't tell me what to do. They just told me that they would inform the people who installed it to assess and fix it. So that makes me think that maintenance was in the hands of the installers."
43,2022-09-29,46," **Interviewer**: I'm confused, whose phone numbers were left here? Whom did you call?"," **Interviewee**: Two different groups of people worked on the digester. The first group was two people who came to install it, and the other group was of five people from Lilongwe who came to commission it. So, I think I called the people who commissioned it, and they told me that they would inform the people who installed it to come and fix it. I waited for them to come, but they never showed up. But, I also received another group of people who, I think we were monitoring all the digesters in my Malawi, because they said before here there were in Mangochi. If I'm not mistaken, I think it was six people and they came in two big cars. They asked me a number of questions, and I basically told them how it stopped working and how it was stolen."
43,2022-09-29,47, **Interviewer**: You said it worked for 2 months; did it meet your needs in those 2 months?," **Interviewee**: No! Of course, it was producing gas, but sometimes when I wanted to cook it wasn't producing the gas. So, I was finding myself igniting and cooking on firewood. Thus, it worked, but it didn't reach the level I expected or hoped for."
43,2022-09-29,48, **Interviewer**: What was your wish and expectation?," **Interviewee**: To use it in the morning, afternoon, and at night."
43,2022-09-29,49," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were the challenges?"," **Interviewee**: The biggest challenge I had with the digester was feeding it. It was tiresome work. Of course, feeding it to start it up was intense, but I kind of accepted it because I know it's not always easy to start up anything in life. It was very hard to make feedstock of six bags (50kg) of cow manure and a drum (200 liters) of water, but I accepted it. What was not acceptable to me was the fact that I had to feed it on a daily basis. I even asked the installers, if it was possible to rest for at least a day or two. They said no, feeding was supposed to happen on a daily basis to produce gas. And, the hard part that time was that I didn't have a tap of water here. So, I was going to the borehole to get water and that wasn't easy. Also, preparing the feedstock itself wasn't easy."
43,2022-09-29,50, **Interviewer**: Did the digester ever produce fire for more than 30 minute or 1 hour?," **Interviewee**: No, it never past that."
43,2022-09-29,51, **Interviewer**: How was the fire dying? Was it dying at once or was gradually?, **Interviewee**: It was always gradual.
43,2022-09-29,52, **Interviewer**: Did it have a leakage?," **Interviewee**: No, they told me that I should be paying attention to a white bottle, which traps moisture and impurities before gas goes to the burners. They said because digesters produce moist which often accumulates in a white bottle, and blocks the flow of gas. They said when it blocks; I should drain the water from the water trap. So, I paid close attention to that part, but it never filled with water to the point it could have blocked the gas. I believe water never accumulated in the water trap to block the flow of gas because it only worked for a very short time. So, I can say the bag didn't leak gas and the stove was also good, and even now, it's still good."
43,2022-09-29,53," **Interviewer**: So is it that after 2 months it stopped producing gas, so you just abandoned it? OR, you didn't like it was working?"," **Interviewee**: It stopped producing gas completely, and that's when I called them. Then, they told me that they would inform the installers to come and fix it, but they never came. And, the time between the call and the day it was damaged was long enough that if they could have wanted to come they would have."
43,2022-09-29,54, **Interviewer**: Like how long was it?, **Interviewee**: It was a lot of months.
43,2022-09-29,55," **Interviewer**: 2, 3 or 4 months?"," **Interviewee**: It was a lot of months, maybe 6 or 7 months. And, it got me thinking that maybe digesters don't get repaired, or maybe they occupied with other things, or I shouldn't give up because government things are always followed up regardless of how long it may take."
43,2022-09-29,56, **Interviewer**: Did you try anything to fix it?," **Interviewee**: The only thing I tried was feeding it because my thinking was that it works after feeding, so maybe if I feed it, it will work. So, I tried to feed it a couple times hoping that gas production would resume, but it never worked."
43,2022-09-29,57, **Interviewer**: How many times did you feed after it stopped working?, **Interviewee**: I fed it for a week then I stopped after noticing no improvements.
43,2022-09-29,58," **Interviewer**: A digester produces slurry at the outlet, which can be used as fertilizer. Did you get slurry from your digester?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was producing slurry."
43,2022-09-29,59," **Interviewer**: So, what was the outlet like?"," **Interviewee**: They told me to dig a hole for the collection of slurry at the outlet. So, I dug one a small hole not as big as the hole for the digester bag, but I wasn't lined with a brick wall around it or plastered."
43,2022-09-29,60, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that the slurry could be used as fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: No, I wasn't told."
43,2022-09-29,61," **Interviewer**: So, you didn't do anything with it?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, the digester was releasing a liquid, but it wasn't like it was releasing the liquid on a daily basis, so once it got in the hole it was seeping into the ground."
43,2022-09-29,62, **Interviewer**: Wasn't it harboring mosquitoes?," **Interviewee**: No, it wasn't."
43,2022-09-29,63, **Interviewer**: Was it producing any odor?," **Interviewee**: No, it wasn't."
43,2022-09-29,64, **Interviewer**: Did you have problems with it?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't as it wasn't a lot, and was always seeping in the ground."
43,2022-09-29,65, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this?, **Interviewee**: No.
43,2022-09-29,66," **Interviewer**: What do you think of this kind of information, and do you think it would have helped?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, the information would have helped. I believe anything that is manufactured in a factory can be fixed. So, if I was trained or given this kind of information, I would have been able to fix it. What I needed that time was information to enlighten me how to act in a case of a malfunction, and I wouldn't have bothered to call the installers. Or, I would have called them after failing to fix it myself according to this information. So the same way I was trying to feed it like I was told, I would have also been doing what this information stipulates."
43,2022-09-29,67," **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of our interview. We are in September of 2022, if the installers can call you today to inquire about the current state of your digester, what would you say?"," **Interviewee**: I would tell them what I\'m telling you today that the digester stopped working. And after that, some people tore the digester bag. I can't really figure out what they thought was inside the digester bag though. I think they thought that it had something valuable in it. They were tricked by the fact that it was inflating, so the thought something special was in it."
43,2022-09-29,68, **Interviewer**: What did you do with the things that were inside the bag?," **Interviewee**: It looks like some slurry that had no odor, so we just left it in the hole."
43,2022-09-29,69, **Interviewer**: It's good fertilizer.," **Interviewee**: Oh, we just left it in the hole. I think you are right; it is fully processed fertilizer from manure. But, they didn't tell us that it is fertilizer."
43,2022-09-29,70," **Interviewer**: Okay. How did it reach this stage? And in your opinion, what caused it?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know what really went wrong, because when I looked at the equipment, for example, the stove, the white bottle, everything was okay. The green pipe was also okay. But, I suspected that there was a blockage in the green pipe, so gas wasn't flowing because I can't say the digester bag because it was full. So, that's just my guess."
43,2022-09-29,71," **Interviewer**: Yeah, it could be. How do you meet your energy needs now that the digester is not working?"," **Interviewee**: Nowadays I use an electric stove, charcoal burners and an energy efficient wood-stove. The efficient stove was brought here by Plan Malawi, and I have to say that efficient stoves really save wood. With two sticks, you can warm water for bathing and even cook nsima afterwards."
43,2022-09-29,72," **Interviewer**: So out of all the different methods of cooking, which one do you use more often?", **Interviewee**: I use charcoal more often.
43,2022-09-29,73, **Interviewer**: How much charcoal do you use in a month?, **Interviewee**: I use two bags of charcoal.
43,2022-09-29,74, **Interviewer**: How much is a bag of charcoal here?," **Interviewee**: It's K4000 or K5000. Some sellers even go as low as K3800, but it depends on the quality of the charcoal."
43,2022-09-29,75, **Interviewer**: How much electricity do you use?," **Interviewee**: It's hard to estimate because I don't a specific budget for that. Also, I can really know how much is he spent on electricity in regards to cooking because I use it for other purposes as well, for example, lighting or as a power source for my TV."
43,2022-09-29,76, **Interviewer**: Do you still get wood where I used to get wood that time?," **Interviewee**: Nowadays we buy wood, because even if we can go to where we used to get wood, we can't find it now. So, people from far distance that bring the firewood here and sell it to us. I don't know how they get that much wood, they have their own strategies of finding firewood, I guess."
43,2022-09-29,77," **Interviewer**: In a month, how much wood do you buy?"," **Interviewee**: It depends on usage because I sell thobwa (sweet beer) which I cook on firewood. So, when business is good, I use a lot of firewood. Also, as you know thobwa is seasonal, so in wet or rainy season I don't sell thobwa. Thus, in wet and rainy season I use a small amount of firewood. So, I can say I use wood of K3000 per month on average."
43,2022-09-29,78, **Interviewer**: We have about five questions to finish. How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: I wasn't told anything regarding that.
43,2022-09-29,79," **Interviewer**: And, you mentioned that you don't know who provided the funds for it too?", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
43,2022-09-29,80, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: I can say I only spent money on women who helped me in collecting water.
43,2022-09-29,81," **Interviewer**: So, it's only the money?", **Interviewee**: Is it worth saying that you gave a visitor like you food?
43,2022-09-29,82," **Interviewer**: Oh, cooked for them?"," **Interviewee**: No, I just bought them soft drinks. So, I think it\'s not proper to say I gave them that, because I had a choice to give them or not. But , then you look at the money I spent on labor that was mandatory, I couldn't have done otherwise"
43,2022-09-29,83," **Interviewer**: You have said it was you and your son who dug the hole, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
43,2022-09-29,84, **Interviewer**: Was the hole lined with plaster or brick wall?," **Interviewee**: No, it wasn't in lined."
43,2022-09-29,85, **Interviewer**: Did they talk about lining it.," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't. I just dug the hole and when it was placed and full, it fitted perfectly."
43,2022-09-29,86, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: They didn't say anything about that. But, maybe they did at the community meeting when they were selecting the beneficiaries. I think it's at the community meeting where people have learned about where it came from, who funded it and all that. I believe that information was shared at that meeting. So, I think when they came here they thought I had learned everything at the meeting, and that's why they just went straight to business."
43,2022-09-29,87," **Interviewer**: I totally agree, I think a lot was said at the meeting. Do you think you saved any money in the 2 months you used it?"," **Interviewee**: If I saved money, then it\`s just a small amount because even when it was working, I was still using the other methods. So because it was producing gas for a very short time, I was still using charcoal and firewood all the times."
43,2022-09-29,88, **Interviewer**: What was the biggest change in your life the time you had biogas?," **Interviewee**: The first thing I do everyday after waking up is boiling water for bathing, and then I go for players. So, I wake up around dawn to ignite charcoal and it takes a long time for the fire to get intense. But, with biogas, it was taking a very short time to boil the water for bathing. It was so fast and it made me feel so good. And if the digester that was being used that time, it was often for that purpose."
43,2022-09-29,89, **Interviewer**: We are remaining with three questions. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: My opinion of biogas is that if the digester was stable and reliable, then it would have been a good thing. Also, it could have been better, if digesters the feedstock was different. I didn't like the use of manure as feedstock. But, all in all, it seems to be a good technology and I was very saddened when it stopped working. And, I was asking myself questions why it failed. I was like did the installers installed it poorly or what really went wrong. I think if the installers had come to assess the digester, then it could have been revamped in two different ways. Maybe it would have started producing strong fire for a long time, or it could have continued producing as it was, but it would have lasted for a long time. To cut the long short story, I liked digester, but I didn\'t like the intensity of the fire it was producing; the fire was not staying for long, and its feeding procedure is tedious."
43,2022-09-29,90," **Interviewer**: What do you say it was producing weak gas, what is it because of its design or because of the installers? Why do you think it produced little fire?"," **Interviewee**: If they had come to assess it, then we would have known if I was the problem the design or not. If it was the pipes or something, the installers could have told us what the problem was. But, what I can say today is that we did everything according to what they told me, because we wanted it so bad. We believe we understood them very well that what we were doing is what they told me. So, if they had assessed it, then we would have known what the problem was, and it could have done a lot of good to the project. And I don't even think these things were tested before giving the people here. So, I doubt if these things worked somewhere. And the installers seemed to me that they were learning too."
43,2022-09-29,91, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: They seemed to me that they were university students who were learning about biogas and wanted to try them out in the fields. But, I don\'t honestly think it was people who knew what they were doing, and who wanted to install the digesters for us to use."
43,2022-09-29,92," **Interviewer**: Last one, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know which alternative can be used before cooking, so it's going to be hard for me to chose, because to choose something it means you know the thing. Now, I know biogas can be used for cooking, but I don't anything else apart from that. So, I might even choose something worse than biogas. So, I don't know any alternative other than this. But, in my honest opinion, I have to say I wasn't impressed with biogas in terms of how it performed here."
43,2022-09-29,93," **Interviewer**: That was my last question. Do you have anything to say? But before that, we have two types of biogas. Some use animal manure, and others use food waste. What do you think of digesters that use food waste solely? Do you think they can work?"," **Interviewee**: I think it can be very difficult to operate food waste digesters, because food is left by chance and not on purpose. And, by that nature, they are always in small quantities. I don\'t know how much food waste a digester may need it, but I just don't think it can be enough to meet the minimum level. As for animal manure, it was possible because animals do produce a lot of manure, so was a challenge."
43,2022-09-29,94, **Interviewer**: Do you think it's not easy to fill a 20-liter bucket with food waste at household level?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that can even take a week"
43,2022-09-29,95," **Interviewer**: Yeah, or even two months."," **Interviewee**: So, I think those digesters can work in a restaurant setting, but not at the house level. I mean at household level what is left is small piece of nsima, vegetables and other tiny pieces of food, so that's not enough."
43,2022-09-29,96," **Interviewer**: In closing, what are your last words?"," **Interviewee**: I would like to thank you and the people who donated the digester. It's sad for us, and for the donors as well because they expected us to use. I don't think they would give out things which they knew for sure wouldn't work or work for a very short time. The donors and beneficiaries were on one accord, we wanted to protect the environment. So, many thanks to them though the digesters didn't work. My second word is for the people who are doing this that they shouldn't give up. They have already spent a lot of resources to come up with the digesters. So, they need to persist and find better ways of improving them. I don't think they need to change or make adjustments, if people like me are to benefit from the digesters."
43,2022-09-29,97," **Interviewer**: Thanks a lot, thanks for the interview. Do you know anyone else who was installed this?"," **Interviewee**: No, but the clerk of the TA when he came here, he said they were planning that all the beneficiary they should meet and form a group to share experience and resources. But, that never happened because some digesters didn't work at all. So, I don\'t know anyone else who was installed a digester here in Nsanama, because we never seat down as beneficiaries."
43,2022-09-29,98, **Interviewer**: Okay thanks. Thanks for the interview. I really appreciate your time.," **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming here too, you have got me talking about things of the past, that was wonderful."
43,2022-09-29,99, **Interviewer**: Thanks.,NA
44,2022-09-29,1,Where did this digester originate from?,I don't know where it came from; I have forgotten.
44,2022-09-29,2, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you or did you ask?," **Interviewee**: I asked but because I do not know how to writing, I lost it."
44,2022-09-29,3, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?, **Interviewee**: I think it was a non-governmental organization and it collaborated with the government.
44,2022-09-29,4," **Interviewer**: Okay, do you know the name of this organization?", **Interviewee**: No.
44,2022-09-29,5, **Interviewer**: When was it built?," **Interviewee**: I do not really remember the specific date, but I think 4 or 5 years have passed."
44,2022-09-29,6, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came to install this?, **Interviewee**: They came two times. The first time two people came and the last time four people came.
44,2022-09-29,7, **Interviewer**: What was your first encounter with them?," **Interviewee**: First, the chiefs called us for a community meeting to brief us about the project. So, they basically told us that biogas system uses animal manure to produce energy for cooking. I believe in each village one person was chosen. In my village, when I saw that people were unwilling to accept it, I volunteered to get it, and then people encouraged to get it. I basically accepted the digester because I anticipated that in the future, it was going to help, and then once people saw its benefits they would adopt it themselves."
44,2022-09-29,8, **Interviewer**: How did you expect it to help you?," **Interviewee**: There were certain things that were explained, and I found compelling. Nowadays, firewood is scarce, so I thought that it was going to help me in this regard. Also, I thought the digester was going to help me protect and restore trees. The main aim of the coming of the digesters here was for us to find an alternative for cooking, and then protect the environment."
44,2022-09-29,9," **Interviewer**: Okay, why were people unwilling to accept it?"," **Interviewee**: I think many people thought they would not manage to source manure. Or, maybe some people just refused it out of fear, as a result of poor thinking."
44,2022-09-29,10, **Interviewer**: What did they fear?, **Interviewee**: Maybe they just thought they would not manage it - Just fear of failure.
44,2022-09-29,11," **Interviewer**: So did you accept it for the sake of being a chief, like you did not want it to pass your village since all your subjects declined it, or did you accept it because you had the necessary requirements and liked it?"," **Interviewee**: I accepted it because I had goats, so I knew I could manage. And, when the installers came, they made us gather manure, and then advised us to prepare feedstock. So from that point onwards, I had no fear and I knew that I would manage to run the digester."
44,2022-09-29,12, **Interviewer**: How many goats did you have that time?, **Interviewee**: I had eight goats.
44,2022-09-29,13," **Interviewer**: so, some people did not accept it....", **Interviewee**: Yeah! When the senior chief asked people to volunteer to get the digester everyone was just quiet.
44,2022-09-29,14, **Interviewer**: What was your role?," **Interviewee**: My first role was to accept it with a joy because I knew that whoever was giving us the digester had a purpose here in Malawi. Secondly, I thought that the donors were generously to village people like us who are shortsighted in our thinking. So, I accepted it to make it appealing to the people who denied it in the first place, so that they could adopt it later too."
44,2022-09-29,15, **Interviewer**: Did you dig a hole when it came?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I dug a hole with my children."
44,2022-09-29,16, **Interviewer**: How many children?, **Interviewee**: Two children.
44,2022-09-29,17, **Interviewer**: Did the installers take part in the digging?," **Interviewee**: No, they just advised us to dig it."
44,2022-09-29,18, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to dig the hole?," **Interviewee**: It took us two day, as you know the bag was huge. So, to make it fit hole, the hole had to be big and wide too."
44,2022-09-29,19, **Interviewer**: What advice did they give you?," **Interviewee**: The advice was just on how deep and wide the hole was supposed to be. I have forgotten the dimensions though. But, it was a big hole."
44,2022-09-29,20," **Interviewer**: In this village, we have so many people and so many households; I want to get a full picture of how you were selected on that particular day."," **Interviewee**: Okay good, you are going to get me clear on this one. What happened was that, our Late Senior Chief offered the digester to the people, but no one accepted. After a very long time, more than you have stayed here (15 -- 20 minutes), the Senior Chief stood up and asked the people what was the way forward. Then, some loud person from the group just shouted that it should be given to the chief, like it should be given to me. And, everybody was like let us just give it to the chief, and that is how I got it. And, I could not have said no because everyone wanted me to have it, and I thought that I could manage it. After that, I committed myself to manage it."
44,2022-09-29,21," **Interviewer**: So, I shouldn't think that it was just thrown to you by the people?"," **Interviewee**: No, and I was happy to have it because it is a special thing here in my Malawi and I've never seen it anywhere else in Malawi."
44,2022-09-29,22, **Interviewer**: Where was this selection process made? Was it at the TAs meeting place or at Senior Chief's meeting place?," **Interviewee**: I believe we first met at the Senior Chief\`s meeting place, and then we went to the TA's meeting place."
44,2022-09-29,23, **Interviewer**: So it's like the T/A asked the Senior Chief to hold the meeting....," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and whoever was chosen was supposed to go to the T/As meeting place, and went there."
44,2022-09-29,24, **Interviewer**: What was it like at the T/As meeting place?," **Interviewee**: They communicated to us that we were lucky to be chosen as beneficiaries from different villages, and they hoped that many people would get the digesters if they worked."
44,2022-09-29,25," **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before? If I have heard you correctly, you didn't know about it, right?"," **Interviewee**: I knew it when I was called to the Senior Chiefs meeting place. And, it was where they communicated that the digesters would help us in cooking as well as in saving the environment."
44,2022-09-29,26," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were you expectations?"," **Interviewee**: I expected that after installation and upon completing everything, I would be able to use it for cooking."
44,2022-09-29,27, **Interviewer**: What were you told me to expect from the digester by the installers?, **Interviewee**: The installers told us that the digesters were forcooking.
44,2022-09-29,28," **Interviewer**: Apart from this, what else were you told to expect?"," **Interviewee**: Apart from cooking, if I'm not mistaken, they told us that it could be used for lighting, and as a source of fertilizer."
44,2022-09-29,29, **Interviewer**: Where did they say the manure was going to come from?," **Interviewee**: They said that digesters produces digestate, and we only needed to collect and use it as fertilizer."
44,2022-09-29,30," **Interviewer**: Did you ever use the digestate, or for lighting?"," **Interviewee**: No, it never occurred."
44,2022-09-29,31," **Interviewer**: I've seen that one woman accepted it, and it's not too far from this here..."," **Interviewee**: Oh yeah. That's Nyama Village. So, when the people of Nyama Village sat down to choose a beneficiary, she was chosen. As for Mkasaulo Village, nobody accepted it and that's why Group Village Headman (GVH) \[name redacted\] took it. And the question you are trying to put out, we got asked at the T/A\`s meeting place. They asked us why we chiefs got the digesters. Didn't we have people who could have got the digesters? So, we told them everything that had happened, and that people refused to accept the digester. So, we got asked the same question (laughs)"
44,2022-09-29,32," **Interviewer**: Yeah, honestly it doesn't look good because it may seem as you used your powers or your position to get the digesters."," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) Yeah, but we told them that people had denied it, and we couldn\'t have afforded to let it go to another area."
44,2022-09-29,33," **Interviewer**: When I look at the three of you; Chief \[name redacted\], you and the woman, I can't say you used it; it all ended in total failure. But, the woman at least did better than you. Why did the chiefs fail miserable, when you were supposed to be exemplary as leaders?"," **Interviewee**: Interesting... mm-mmh... In a community setting like this, we do have people who are smarter than chiefs. Some people do things better than the Chiefs, and are even more successful in wealth. It happens, that's life. But in this instance, we felt because they didn't give us a full set of the equipment - they only came once. As for that woman, she was given everything."
44,2022-09-29,34, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: If I ever learned about biogas, it was at the community meeting at the TAs meeting place. But, there was no special training for the beneficiaries."
44,2022-09-29,35, **Interviewer**: What did you learn at the TA\'s meeting place?," **Interviewee**: They only ask us to take good care of the digesters and that it's helpful. So, they told us how useful it is, and that it needs manure to work, and also that the installers would teach us more about the digesters."
44,2022-09-29,36, **Interviewer**: What were you told in regards to taking care of it?," **Interviewee**: They told us that when the installers come and finish everything they would tell us how to manage it in order to keep it safe and long. But, they didn't tell us how we were supposed to take care of it."
44,2022-09-29,37, **Interviewer**: Why do you think of the installers never came back?," **Interviewee**: mm-mmh, I don't know. I heard at GVH \[name redacted\] place they didn't finish everything too."
44,2022-09-29,38," **Interviewer**: Yeah, they only brought a digester and a pipe. But, after some time, some people came to follow up on the digester. Did they come here?"," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't. Maybe they thought it wasn't necessary to come here after what happened at Mpita's place."
44,2022-09-29,39," **Interviewer**: Yeah, you mentioned that you accepted this because you wanted to use it for cooking. Secondly, you wanted other people to learn it, so that they could appreciate and adopt it later. Apart from these, is there any other reason why you accepted it?"," **Interviewee**: Also, when I looked at the environment, it's trees which makes the environment flourish, so I wanted to reduced the cutting down of trees and make the world a better place. Also, I feel like if we are going to continue cutting trees as we are, we are not going to find firewood for cooking in the near future. So to avoid that, I decided to accept the digester."
44,2022-09-29,40," **Interviewer**: The environment is flouring because of tree, could you please elaborate on that."," **Interviewee**: I'm saying the environment flourishes with trees because we get rains because of trees. Of course, it's God who provides rain, but for that to happen you need trees to facilitate the process. Thus, if we cut trees and use it for silly thing, the amount of rain decreases as well."
44,2022-09-29,41," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did you make your energy needs before the intervention?"," **Interviewee**: That time I was cooking with firewood, but it was a struggle as firewood is not easy to find. Sometimes, my wife was using dry pigeon plants as firewood. But, we were luck that time because a certain NGO came and encouraged us to plant private trees. So, we get firewood from the private trees."
44,2022-09-29,42," **Interviewer**: What is the name of this organization, and what was their project like?"," **Interviewee**: Every year we do have a tree-planting program, which is spearheaded by government forest officials with funding from a certain NGO. At this tree planting session, we plant trees at our community forest and also people are given free seedlings of tree to plant for personal use. So, some people have personal woodlot, which they get firewood from."
44,2022-09-29,43, **Interviewer**: Okay nice. How do people benefit from the community forest?," **Interviewee**: Sometimes the whole community is asked to go to the forest take care of it, and then people get dry fallen wood, which they use as firewood in their homes."
44,2022-09-29,44, **Interviewer**: Nice. How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: Now that I don't have goats, I'm struggling because I only rely on inorganic fertilizer. When I had goats, I was only buying one bag of inorganic fertilizer then I was mixing it with goat manure to make two bags of fertilizer. To make this, you only need to mix one bag of inorganic with goat manure and add yeast, or baking soda or ash, then put it in a plastic bag for a week. After a week, you find the goat manure completely broken down and ready to be used as fertilizer. You only need to be careful when you are opening the plastic bag because the heat that comes out of it is intense, it can even affect your eyes if you are not careful (laughs). This type of fertilizer is effective and once you have it, you can't bother to buy fertilizer from the shops."
44,2022-09-29,45," **Interviewer**: Okay, where did you learn this?", **Interviewee**: We learnt this from a certain NGO.
44,2022-09-29,46, **Interviewer**: What's the name of this NGO?," **Interviewee**: Mm-hmm, I have forgotten its name."
44,2022-09-29,47, **Interviewer**: What about agriculture extension workers?," **Interviewee**: Oh yeah, they also teach us this."
44,2022-09-29,48," **Interviewer**: Let's try to see what transpired from this digester though it never worked. First, which materials were you given?", **Interviewee**: I was given a digester bag and two white pipes as an outlet and inlet.
44,2022-09-29,49," **Interviewer**: Did you get the material yourself? Or, they brought it here?", **Interviewee**: I went myself to collect the equipment on a bicycle.
44,2022-09-29,50, **Interviewer**: They didn't bring the equipment?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't. I got it myself from the agriculture office at Nsanama."
44,2022-09-29,51, **Interviewer**: Did all the beneficiary got the equipment by themselves?, **Interviewee**: I remember we got it ourselves -- I haven't forgotten. I took it myself.
44,2022-09-29,52," **Interviewer**: Why didn't you get all the equipment, for example, the stove and other pipes?", **Interviewee**: They didn't give us those. They said they would bring the equipment themselves. No beneficiary got all those things that day.
44,2022-09-29,53," **Interviewer**: Did you take the equipment first? Or, the installers came first?"," **Interviewee**: We took the materials first, and then they came here to advise us on how to dig the hole."
44,2022-09-29,54, **Interviewer**: How long did it take?," **Interviewee**: They came before 2 weeks, I think"
44,2022-09-29,55," **Interviewer**: So on the day the installers came, what did you do?"," **Interviewee**: We started digging the hole, and it took us 2 days."
44,2022-09-29,56, **Interviewer**: Did you place the bag on your own?," **Interviewee**: No, the installers came."
44,2022-09-29,57, **Interviewer**: I hope you also fed it that day.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they guided us how to make feedstock, and then they told us they would come back to assemble it and teach us how to operate it."
44,2022-09-29,58, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you feed it with?," **Interviewee**: They advised us to feed it with 2bags (50kg) of manure, if not more."
44,2022-09-29,59, **Interviewer**: And water too I guess., **Interviewee**: Yeah
44,2022-09-29,60," **Interviewer**: How much water did you add, and where did you get it from?"," **Interviewee**: I got the manure from my animal house, and I got the water from the borehole."
44,2022-09-29,61, **Interviewer**: Like how far from here?, **Interviewee**: Our community borehole is not far from our house. It's about 400 meter.
44,2022-09-29,62, **Interviewer**: So you fed the feedstock into the digester?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
44,2022-09-29,63, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add to the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We added 4 or 5 buckets (20 liter), and after a week, the bag got full."
44,2022-09-29,64, **Interviewer**: After this what happened?," **Interviewee**: After we fed the bag, it started inflating. But, it was not completely assembly as other pipes were not there. Then, after we saw the installers were not coming, and that the feedstock was producing strong odor, we decided to remove the digester."
44,2022-09-29,65," **Interviewer**: I thought when you fed it, the inlet and outlet pipes were covered, so how was it producing odor?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, the pipes had covering. But, after some time, I decided to go and take out the coverings and that's when I smelled the odor. And, that's when I knew the inside was not good - rotten. After this, I wanted to call them, but I didn't do so as I had no contacts of them."
44,2022-09-29,66," **Interviewer**: When the installers were leaving, when did they tell you that they were going to come back?"," **Interviewee**: They left on the 15^th^ or so of month, and they told us that they would come at the end of the month to assemble the remaining equipment."
44,2022-09-29,67," **Interviewer**: When did you open the covering, and why?"," **Interviewee**: After I saw that two or three months had passed, I decided to check it out, because I was like they are not coming back."
44,2022-09-29,68," **Interviewer**: After feeding it the first time, did you ever feed it again?"," **Interviewee**: No, I knew that even I feed it nothing would happen because I knew that the installers were not coming again -- so there was no need."
44,2022-09-29,69, **Interviewer**: What were operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: They told us that it's easier for people who have cows to run it, as manure is not a problem. But, for us since we had no cows, we would use goat manure to start it up, so it was going to take a lot of effort and time to gather. Then, there was no need to worry because we would be feeding it with small quantities of feedstock."
44,2022-09-29,70," **Interviewer**: After starting it up, how much feedstock were you supposed to feed it up with and how often?", **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us that.
44,2022-09-29,71, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you how to make feedstock?, **Interviewee**: No.
44,2022-09-29,72, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements? Did they say anything about repairs?, **Interviewee**: They told us that after installation they would give us their contact to call them whenever there was a problem.
44,2022-09-29,73," **Interviewer**: So they didn't give you their numbers, but you expected to get their numbers after commissioning?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but they didn't come again to commission it (laughs)"
44,2022-09-29,74, **Interviewer**: Why do you think they never come back?, **Interviewee**: That I don't know.
44,2022-09-29,75," **Interviewer**: Or, do you think they didn't come because they saw that you couldn't manage it to the extent of thinking that returning to assemble it was simply a waste of time. What do you think?"," **Interviewee**: No, goat manure is not a problem in this community. People can't deny me goat manure. So, on my part, manure wasn't a problem. Even when I don't have enough inorganic fertilizer, I go around asking for goat manure and people give me without challenges."
44,2022-09-29,76," **Interviewer**: My next question was to ask you if it met your needs, but to ask that question would be wrong. What are your cooking needs?", **Interviewee**: I just want to cook at least 3 times a day.
44,2022-09-29,77," **Interviewer**: Many things happened with this digester, when you look back, what were the challenges?"," **Interviewee**: The challenge with this digester is that it didn't work, and I was very saddened by that."
44,2022-09-29,78," **Interviewer**: Did you follow up? I mean, did you inform the TA or Senior Chief?"," **Interviewee**: I informed the Senior Chief, but not the TA. I think, I was wrong on that. Maybe, he could have followed up the matter."
44,2022-09-29,79, **Interviewer**: What did you tell the Senior Chief and what did he say?," **Interviewee**: I told him that the installers were not coming, and he just said it was hard to follow up since we had no contacts. So, we were lost and there was nothing we could have done."
44,2022-09-29,80," **Interviewer**: You have admitted that you don't know how to read and write. So, what I have here is information regarding problems associated with digesters, their causes and related solutions. What do you think of the information and do you think it would have helped in your case?", **Interviewee**: It would have helped.
44,2022-09-29,81, **Interviewer**: How and why?," **Interviewee**: It would have helped us because it could have given us clues on what to do. But, the information should have been given to us after installation, and not before it was not fully installed because we could have done nothing with it. So, maybe they didn't give us this information because they weren't done with the installation."
44,2022-09-29,82, **Interviewer**: What is the current state of your digester?," **Interviewee**: Honestly speaking, the digester bag is damaged. I should not lie to you because it won't do us any good, it is broken."
44,2022-09-29,83, **Interviewer**: Do you have the pipes?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we still have the white pipes."
44,2022-09-29,84, **Interviewer**: What about the bag?, **Interviewee**: It's what I said it's damaged.
44,2022-09-29,85," **Interviewer**: I mean, how? Or, what is the extent of the damage?"," **Interviewee**: It was eaten by termites, and it was damaged in the house by rats too."
44,2022-09-29,86," **Interviewer**: Oh, you mean termites can eat that hard thing?"," **Interviewee**: Yeaaah, termites were eating it up! And, even if you can see the bag you can know that termites were eating it up."
44,2022-09-29,87, **Interviewer**: How did you remove ii?," **Interviewee**: After a year when we saw the installers were not coming, we removed it, and that's when we noted that it was being eaten by termites. Then, we got it to the storeroom and there too rats were eating it up."
44,2022-09-29,88, **Interviewer**: What happened to the manure that was inside?, **Interviewee**: After we removed it we just disposed it anyhow because didn't know it's use.
44,2022-09-29,89," **Interviewer**: so, you didn't use it as fertilizer?"," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't."
44,2022-09-29,90, **Interviewer**: I can see you are using the digester bag as a roofing sheet.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I just decided to use it that way after finding no real use for it."
44,2022-09-29,91, **Interviewer**: I have also seen you are using it as a makeshift door for your pit latrine.," **Interviewee**: That's true... it's not like after I got it out I sold it, no! I didn't thought about selling it (laughs)"
44,2022-09-29,92," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Can a person buy that, for what?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) Aah, it's useless"
44,2022-09-29,93, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you sell it?," **Interviewee**: It's not good for a chief to sell government property. I mean, what if other people see you, then how would you discipline them (Laughs). So, we should be the first ones to show respect to other people's property, so that others can learn from us too."
44,2022-09-29,94," **Interviewer**: What happened to your digesters is a pity, that shouldn't have happened. It's making laugh at times because what happened was bizarre. In your opinion, why would an organization send people to do a job and then stop in the process?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know. But, in my head sometimes, I'm not judging anyone though, I think the installers decided to sell the equipment somewhere else. I do think so. I mean, the way we talked the time they came, I didn't think more than 4 years would pass without returning. God forbid, I think that the boys who came to install the digesters sold some of the equipment. Honestly, I did think the boys did sell the equipment somewhere, and I was saddened by it."
44,2022-09-29,95," **Interviewer**: Yeah, it could be possible. I mean, where is the equipment? Now how do you meet your energy needs? Do you still use the firewood and dry pigeon peas plants?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's still the same."
44,2022-09-29,96," **Interviewer**: Now you don't have goats or any livestock, right?", **Interviewee**: I don't keep any livestock now.
44,2022-09-29,97, **Interviewer**: How much did the reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us. Maybe if they had come to commission it, they would have told us."
44,2022-09-29,98," **Interviewer**: And they didn't tell you who provided the funds, right? And, it's not the government, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
44,2022-09-29,99, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: No, we contributed nothing\... Frankly speaking, we didn't contribute anything\... Of course, it's been a long time, but I can certainly say we didn't contribute anything."
44,2022-09-29,100," **Interviewer**: So if you ever spent anything on it, then it\`s was just the energy", **Interviewee**: Right!
44,2022-09-29,101," **Interviewer**: Is it two of you, who dug the hole?"," **Interviewee**: It was me together with my two grandsons. So, it was three of us."
44,2022-09-29,102," **Interviewer**: You said you did put the digester in the hole, was the hole lined?"," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't say anything about that."
44,2022-09-29,103," **Interviewer**: I've heard some people were told to find sand, and bricks, and that the installers promised to provide cement, so that they could line the hole in which the digester was placed."," **Interviewee**: I have heard they did that to some people, and they never brought the cement. This clearly show that they stole cement -- I feel bitter about those guys -- and If you were them, I would have asked "" is this how you conduct yourself?"" The government want the livelihood of people from rural communities to change and you are robbing us (laughs heavily)."
44,2022-09-29,104," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Oh, you were robbed?", **Interviewee**: (laughs) Obviously!
44,2022-09-29,105," **Interviewer**: If you are certain that you were robbed, why didn't you take the issue somewhere, for example, the police or any other relevant government authority?"," **Interviewee**: It never crossed our mind. That's why I always say education is good because it makes people became far-sighted. Of course, I'm a chief, but I'm not educated. I just use God's given knowledge and wisdom. That's why most things do not work for us. And, that's why I encourage me children to go to school. I don't want them to suffer like me, and that's why I allow myself to do menial works to gain something, so that they should go to school.... I do feel pain for being uneducated!"
44,2022-09-29,106," **Interviewer**: I like the desire you have for children, do that, and never slow down; you will gain great rewards someday.... So, you think if you were educated, this wouldn't have happened?"," **Interviewee**: No, that wouldn't have happened because I would have pressed them to finish this. The problem is that I only have natural intelligence. But, I feel lucky that I'm a chief and I'm able to connect with intellectuals."
44,2022-09-29,107, **Interviewer**: (laughs) so you only have natural wisdom...," **Interviewee**: (laughs) that's what I use -- I use natural intelligence, and the knowledge that I gain from meetings, trainings and conferences to lead the people without troubles."
44,2022-09-29,108, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: When I saw it, I knew that it was from another country."
44,2022-09-29,109, **Interviewer**: What did you see?," **Interviewee**: I mean, we were given the digesters to try them here, so I believe someone from outside the country wanted to try the digesters in Malawi -- That's what I thought!"
44,2022-09-29,110, **Interviewer**: What do you think who brought the digesters here in Malawi would say about what happened?," **Interviewee**: It could be that the project implementers gave them the report, and they want to verify the reports through you... so they have sent you to investigate the matter to see what really happened, so we can't hide or hold any information from you, because if we do that it will not do anyone good (laughs)."
44,2022-09-29,111, **Interviewer**: That's true. If it could have worked as they said do you think it could have saved you any money?, **Interviewee**: Yes
44,2022-09-29,112, **Interviewer**: How?," **Interviewee**: It could have basically helped us in cooking and in saving trees as well, so these have serious economic implications."
44,2022-09-29,113, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I feel like I have unfinished business with the digester, though it may seem that I didn't take good care of it by taking it out and use it for other purposes. I did that against my will and I was forced to do that because I was just seeing the bag doing nothing. I removed it because a lot of time had pass, so I thought they had abandoned it and it was useless. But, my position on biogas is that it is good especially when I consider how populated we have become, we really need an alternative to firewood because it's no sustainable, and it's not good for the environment too."
44,2022-09-29,114," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own waste of energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: Instead of biogas, I would have chosen a good solar system to use it for cooking. I think solar system can help a lot. I can't say electricity because it needs money. For example, in my area, we have electricity lines, but I'm not connected because it needs money."
44,2022-09-29,115," **Interviewer**: Oh, you electricity in your area?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we have it, but my house is not connected because I'm poor and can't manage to pay connection fee."
44,2022-09-29,116," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. Last words, before we conclude the interview.", **Interviewee**: You should help us.
44,2022-09-29,117, **Interviewer**: How? Should I find the person who didn't bring the materials? (laughs), **Interviewee**: (Laughs) help us get solar system or even another biogas.
44,2022-09-29,118," **Interviewer**: I get you, thanks a lot chief.", **Interviewee**: (laughs) I thank you for coming too.
45,2022-09-29,1,Where did the digester of originate from?,"It came with people from University; I don't know the name of the University thought. The people told me that they were going to put a stove in the kitchen, and that I had to dig a hole for the digester. They also told me that the digester would use animal manure, for example, goat, pig and cow manure. They further explained that I would be able to get energy for cooking as well as fertilizer from the digester."
45,2022-09-29,2,"The installers mentioned that they came from a university, but you have forgotten the university. Was it Poly, Mzuzu or Chanco?"," **Interviewee**: I didn't pay much attention to where exactly they were coming from, but I was more focused on the technology they were bringing here. So, just like many villagers would do, I simply accepted the technology without asking questions."
45,2022-09-29,3, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: They didn't explain that. They just told me that they were going to install a technology that produces gas for cooking. Then they told me that they would line the hole for the digester bag and another hole with a brick wall, and that they had people who would do that. After that, they also mentioned that I would be collecting manure from the other hole, which I could use as fertilizer. When I heard about the fertilizer, I called three other chiefs to come and join me in digging the hole, so that they could be getting manure from the digester as well. After we dug the hole, we waited for the installers to come but they never came. They only gave me the things you took pictures of \[a digester bag and one PCV Pipes (110mm)\] on the day they asked us to dig the hole."
45,2022-09-29,4, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came?," **Interviewee**: I think it was four or three people. After this, years went by and five other people visited the digester too."
45,2022-09-29,5, **Interviewer**: What was the purpose of their visit?," **Interviewee**: They told me that their records showed that I was a beneficiary of a digester, so they wanted to follow up on the digesters. Then, I told them that certain people came and left a digester bag and one white pipe. But, they didn't even place the digester bag in the digester hole. I took them to the hole to see it and they took pictures. Then, I told them that I felt like I was robbed and things didn't make sense to me. I also asked if the same had happened to other beneficiaries. Then, they laughed and said that's why they had come to find out what happened to the digesters. Then, I said okay and I asked if they would bring the remaining parts in the future. Then, they told me that they would come back, but before leaving, they stood on that mango tree and asked me to give them their privacy. They stood there for 10 -- 15 minutes, and then they told me that they were going, and would come back at some point. Since, then they have never returned and I have never heard of biogas until I got your call the other time, and talked and provided you directions and all that."
45,2022-09-29,6, **Interviewer**: What do you mean when you say you were robbed?," **Interviewee**: They took advantage of me and deprived me of what I was supposed to get. They were cunning that I shouldn't get the digester. Let's say they did want me to get the digester, so they stripped and deprived me of the digester."
45,2022-09-29,7," **Interviewer**: Then, why did they give you some other things if they didn't want you to get the digester?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, sometimes you may think you are given meat when it's just a bone! Then, you release later that it's a bone and not meat!"
45,2022-09-29,8, **Interviewer**: (laughs) Oh," **Interviewee**: (laughs) I thought I had meat and I started chewing it, but then I bite it and found out that it was hard bone."
45,2022-09-29,9," **Interviewer**: (laughs) It's common to see chiefs mobilizing community people to help them when there is a project, why did you call other chiefs, not just community people?"," **Interviewee**: It's not as it was in the past where chiefs would just choose people to do certain things for them. Of course, some chiefs to do that, but I'm not that type of person. So, I called the chiefs because I wanted them to inform their subjects that when the digesters become fully functional to bringing manure, so that they could also be getting fertilizer out of it too."
45,2022-09-29,10," **Interviewer**: So, you wanted to make it a community thing, nice. What was your role?"," **Interviewee**: I took the role of a ""treasurer"". I accepted to take care of digester so that other community members would gain processed fertilizer from it by providing raw animal manure ... So, I can say I was a ""treasurer"" because I was a custodian of the digester!"
45,2022-09-29,11," **Interviewer**: Okay, that's one part. The other thing you mentioned that you took part in the dig of the hole together with other three chiefs. How big was the whole and how long did it take you to dig it?"," **Interviewee**: The hole was 3 meter deep and 1.5 meters wide, if I'm not mistaken, and it took us 2 or 3 days. So, after we dug it we waited for them to come and advise us, if the hole was sufficient or not."
45,2022-09-29,12, **Interviewer**: How did you get the bag and that white pipe?," **Interviewee**: The digester bag and the white pipe came before we dug the hole. On that day, they advised us how to dig the hole, and then they gave us the bag and the pipe. Then, they told us that the pipes were not sufficient, so they would come back with pipes and bags of cement to line up the hole with brick wall. So, that day I kept the bag and pipe waiting for them to come back at some point."
45,2022-09-29,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, I get it."," **Interviewee**: And that's when the next people came to follow up the digesters. So, you told the same story."
45,2022-09-29,14, **Interviewer**: So the bag was not installed in the hole? You did put the bag in the hole?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we don't know how to do that, so didn't do anything afterwards. And the time they were leaving, they told us that they would bring a builder to line the wall and place the bag, and then assemble the whole digester."
45,2022-09-29,15, **Interviewer**: (laughs) and they didn't come?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) yeah, they didn't come."
45,2022-09-29,16, **Interviewer**: Did you follow up?, **Interviewee**: Where would we have gone?
45,2022-09-29,17, **Interviewer**: At the T/A (Traditional Authority)," **Interviewee**: We were 3 or 10 beneficiaries, if I heard that one had followed up, I would have followed up too."
45,2022-09-29,18," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. In this village, that you have many people and a lot of households, how were you chosen as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: The digester was not given to me directly by the T/A. The digester was first given to Senior Chief \[name redacted\], who the identified me as a beneficiary because I'm a chief. He chose me so that I could use it for generating fertilizer. And, if I had wished too, I would have given it to an ordinary person too. But, I thought that it wouldn't have been in safe hands. I believed that an ordinary person would have sold it to bicycle taxi people to make seats, or to people who make beehive boxes. You have found it today because it was in safe hands. If it was given to an ordinary person, you wouldn't have found anything. If I was not a chief, I could have sold it way bag (laughs)."
45,2022-09-29,19, **Interviewer**: (laughs) how can people use that in a beehive box?," **Interviewee**: Because it is good plastic, people use that to make a cover for the beehive to prevent water from getting inside."
45,2022-09-29,20," **Interviewer**: So you didn't sell it or didn't make a beehive box, I have seen you have one, because you are a chief. You wanted to save face? (Laughs)", **Interviewee**: (Laughs) and that's why it's still here.
45,2022-09-29,21," **Interviewer**: (laughs) I understand you got the digester because you thought if it was given to an ordinary person, it was not going to be safe. But, surely, there is another reason you accepted it. Why did you accept to build it here apart from what you have told me?"," **Interviewee**: When we want to grow maize we start by digging holes and then put animal manure to act as fertilizer months prior to planting. We use manure here because the soil is so degraded and without doing that, we can't harvest maize. So, when I was told that the digester produce fertilizer I had no choice, but to take it."
45,2022-09-29,22," **Interviewer**: Some people have told me that animal manure is not a good fertilizer, what's your take?"," **Interviewee**: It helps a lot; what you do is, you mix 20 kg of ash with 20 kg of animal manure, then add baking soda of K50 or K100 (50g) and yeast of K50 or K100 too. Then, add water and mix again until the mixture gets wet as mortar. After that, you put the mixture in a plastic bag, and then cover it with a sack bag. After a week, you take it out and add 5kg of inorganic fertilizer and mix as the first time. Then, you put back the mixture in a plastic bag, and then cover it with a sack bag and wait for a week or so. After that, the manure becomes effective as inorganic fertilizer and the maize you get is the same, as you would get after using inorganic fertilizer. And with that manure, you don't whine when you are left out of the agriculture subsidy program."
45,2022-09-29,23, **Interviewer**: Well explain. How did you learn this?," **Interviewee**: We have agriculture extension workers who teach us this, and they call this type of fertilizer ""Whitman"". So clever people make and use this type of fertilizer, and others who are lazy they don't. But, this type of fertilizer is good."
45,2022-09-29,24," **Interviewer**: I didn't know that it\`s name is ""Whitman"". Did you know anything about biogas before?"," **Interviewee**: No. I learnt about biogas the time they told me that they were going to bring it here, but I haven't been given up to date."
45,2022-09-29,25," **Interviewer**: What did they say about it? When you asked them, what did they say it is?"," **Interviewee**: I didn't ask them. They told me about it without asking them, and they told me that with biogas I would be able to use it for cooking and a source of fertilizer for vegetables and maize."
45,2022-09-29,26," **Interviewer**: Okay, how was the selection process like?"," **Interviewee**: I don\'t know how Senior Chief \[name redacted\] was chosen, and how he chose me. I don't know if he was chosen by the T/A - I don't know. I just know that the instrallers we are directed here by Senior Chief \[name redacted\]."
45,2022-09-29,27," **Interviewer**: What were your expectations? First time I have seen that you expected to use it for cooking. Secondly, you expected people to be getting manure from it. How was this going to happen? What was your plan?"," **Interviewee**: After installation, I expected to go to training. Then after the training, I would have made this a community thing by mobilizing all the chiefs under me to sensitize their people about biogas. Also, I would have asked everyone who had livestock, not to throw away manure, but to bring it here so that they could get processed manure from the digester after sometime. I wanted to do this to develop my community."
45,2022-09-29,28," **Interviewer**:That was a brilliant idea. If it could've worked, a lot of people would have benefited."," **Interviewee**: I'm a chief who is known for spearheading community development initiatives. I remember one time I went to Hippo Lodge for stakeholders meeting, and I was applauded for my works. The people there commented that I'm doing a good job, and that they thought I was a big tall person because of my works. But, I'm just a short and slim old person. So, I thanked them very much for the compliments - and it's a good thing to do the good work because when you die you are rewarded by God afterwards for caring for his people."
45,2022-09-29,29," **Interviewer**: Oh, nice. What religion are you?", **Interviewee**: I'm a Sunni Muslim.
45,2022-09-29,30," **Interviewer**: Okay, nice. What kind of training did you receive? Did you have a pre-installation training?"," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't have anything in regards to biogas"
45,2022-09-29,31, **Interviewer**: Were you told about training?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't. I think training would have only happened after installation. After installation that\'s when they would have said let\'s go to Hippo Lodge or any other extravagant place for training (laughs)."
45,2022-09-29,32," **Interviewer**:You have been in some nice place, uh."," **Interviewee**: (laughs) yeah, and I thank the railway company here for that. They have got me to some nice places and they even provide fertilizer to people."
45,2022-09-29,33, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: Here in Mkasaulo and Malawi at large, when we want to cook anything, whether it is sweet potato or cassava, we use traditional three-stove-cooking fire."
45,2022-09-29,34, **Interviewer**: Where did you get firewood?," **Interviewee**: In the past, firewood was not hard to find. That time we used to go to the game reserve to steal firewood, as it was not fenced. Some used to go to the mountains and bush lands to get wood. But, now firewood is scarce because of high population growth, so we use maize cobs and firewood. Luckily, we have now energy efficient stoves that use less firewood. With that, only three sticks of firewood are enough to cook without problems."
45,2022-09-29,35, **Interviewer**: Do you buy wood?," **Interviewee**: I shouldn't lie, we don't."
45,2022-09-29,36, **Interviewer**: How far are your firewood sources?," **Interviewee**: It's very far to go to the mountains to source firewood. As for me, I thank the European Union for giving me trees, which I get firewood from."
45,2022-09-29,37, **Interviewer**: How did that happen?," **Interviewee**: The European Union came here with a tree-planting project where people were given tree to plant, and they made a community woodlot. So, every (group) village here has a forest, and the people have trees too."
45,2022-09-29,38, **Interviewer**: For a digester to work it needs animal manure. Did you have livestock that time?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I had goat manure. And, many other people in this community have goats too."
45,2022-09-29,39, **Interviewer**: How many goats did you have?," **Interviewee**: I had 15 goats. But, people were stealing from me, so I transferred the remaining two goats I had to my mother's house. But, if you another digester could come, it wouldn't be a problem because I can easily get manure from other people or even buy. It's common to get manure for free because people find removing manure from cow houses a difficult task, so when you offer to do that, it's appreciated a lot."
45,2022-09-29,40, **Interviewer**: (laughs) how would someone steal from a chief?," **Interviewee**: Thieves don't steal without using juju. They make you go to the farm and upon returning, you just find the doors open and your goats gone. They even kill the goat in the goat house without you even noticing. (Laughs)"
45,2022-09-29,41, **Interviewer**: I thought that only happen to ordinary people not chiefs!," **Interviewee**: You can't understand thieves; they steal from a highly guarded place and you wonder how what is even possible. So, if people are able to steal where there are guards, what more here."
45,2022-09-29,42," **Interviewer**: My next question was to ask you how it worked after commissioning. But apparently, that question can't be answered because it never worked - it was never installed."," **Interviewee**: It wasn't installed and they didn'tcome to line the hole. If it was installed and lined, then I would have been following up to see what was happening. Today, I don't say that I was given a digester, but I say some people came to me, so that I could keep a digester bag and a pipe safe for them. And, I haven't been paid for that service, so it's as if I have worked for nothing too."
45,2022-09-29,43," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, why was it not installed here?"," **Interviewee**: I keep asking myself that question. Sometimes, I think it's because I'm a chief, so they thought that if I got it people would not benefit anything out of it. But, if they had told me that I was not supposed to get the digester, and an ordinary person from this community was suppose to get it, I would have given it up. And it's not like I wouldn't have benefited from that arrangement, no. I would have been going to that person as well to get manure from the digester. So, I accepted it because I'm old, so it was only necessary for me to stop going around searching for firewood to make life easy for me and my wife too."
45,2022-09-29,44," **Interviewer**: So they thought if you get it other people wouldn't see its benefit, and maybe they didn't like how you were chosen. They thought it wasn't necessary for a chief to get it. So to make life easier for themselves, they just decided not give you the digester."," **Interviewee**: On that, I totally agree. It could be that."
45,2022-09-29,45, **Interviewer**: How many people were expected to use the gas and fertilizer?, **Interviewee**: It was four people.
45,2022-09-29,46," **Interviewer**: I believe that even before installation, you were told what things you would require to operate it, and when you saw that you could manage to get the requirement, you accepted. What were the operation requirements?"," **Interviewee**: They just told me that it would need feeding with animal manure, whether it is cow manure, goat manure, pig manure, or chicken manure."
45,2022-09-29,47, **Interviewer**: And water?," **Interviewee**: They didn\'t reach that stage. I think they would have told us about that at the training. After that time, we were only told to find animal manure."
45,2022-09-29,48, **Interviewer**:So they didn't tell you how prepare to cow manure?," **Interviewee**: They could have told me about that during a training at Hippo Lodge (laughs). And, we could have had our note pads writing everything down (laughs)"
45,2022-09-29,49, **Interviewer**: So up to date that digester bag never got fed?," **Interviewee**: We never installed it, and we never fed it. After the installers gave me the bag, I just kept it in that white building."
45,2022-09-29,50," **Interviewer**:From this, I don't think my next set of question can be answered... I wanted to ask you if it met your needs and even challenges. Did they talk about maintenance?"," **Interviewee**: I think they would have told us about repairs after it was installed after the training. They would have also given us their numbers to report any issues, but after installation."
45,2022-09-29,51," **Interviewer**: If it was installed, what would have been your cooking needs?"," **Interviewee**: To cook on it three times a day. First, I wanted to be able to cook breakfast in the morning. Then, cook lunch and supper before going to bed."
45,2022-09-29,52, **Interviewer**:What challenges did you in regards to this whole thing?, **Interviewee**: It hurts that we didn't have an opportunity to learn about it. The other thing is that the digester bag was damaged by termites.
45,2022-09-29,53, **Interviewer**: How? Did you put it on the ground?," **Interviewee**: Initially, we kept the bag in the house but later found out that the rats were eating it up. So, we got it out and that's where termites started eating it up too."
45,2022-09-29,54, **Interviewer**: Did you think it could be safe outside?," **Interviewee**: It's a thick plastic bag that cannot be damage by water, and it's not like I literally put it on the ground. I did lay some bricks on the ground, and then I placed the bag on top the bricks. And at that time, most of it had already been damaged by the rats, so I didn't care about it, and that's why I even put it outside."
45,2022-09-29,55, **Interviewer**: What do you think of this information? Do you think it's helpful?," **Interviewee**: We were supposed to learn this information at the training. What I mean is after installation, they were supposed to get all the beneficiaries, not just me, to training and teach us these things, so we could have operated and maintained it."
45,2022-09-29,56," **Interviewer**: We are in September of 2022, let's suppose the people who gave you the digester bag and pipe call you, what would you say?"," **Interviewee**: It's straightforward, I can simply ask them to tell me what stage of the project are they now? When are you coming? And then I would tell them that the digester bag was eaten by termites and rats. It's been a lot of years, is it 5 or 10 years? And, all the children that were born around that time have reached puberty stage now (laughs)... So, if I can have a chance to talk to them I would ask them to update me on the project, and to tell me if they would ever come again or not. And if they are coming, I could ask them to bring a new digester bag because the last one is broken, and to bring a stove and the remaining pipes as well."
45,2022-09-29,57, **Interviewer**:I have seen that you are using the digester bag on your pigeon house?," **Interviewee**: I had a thin black plastic sheet, but after strong wind, it was damaged. So I just decided to cut the digester bag and use it as roofing sheet for the pigeon house. And, it's better to keep it there because it can't be lost and it may be used as an evidence that I received a digester bag. I remember, I worked in the gold mines in South Africa, and to get new protective clothes you had to show the old protective clothes, and that's why I keep it too."
45,2022-09-29,58, **Interviewer**: I've seen you have used some remaining part of it as a fence for cassava stalks?," **Interviewee**: Yes, one day I saw that rabbits were eating the cassava stalks from that edge of a corner, so I decided to put it around there and use it as a fence."
45,2022-09-29,59, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. How do you meet your energy needs now?, **Interviewee**: I get wood from the trees around my house and use it on the energy efficient stoves.
45,2022-09-29,60, **Interviewer**: Now you don\'t have livestock. The only two goats you have you keep it at your mothers place\...," **Interviewee**: I decided to put it there because I didn't want thieves to steal it, and give me a heart attack and die. So, if I want to make manure I go there to collect manure and make ""Whitman"" fertilizer."
45,2022-09-29,61, **Interviewer**: How much the reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: I wasn't told, but I think it's a lot of money. But, I can't know the actual amount though."
45,2022-09-29,62, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: Nothing, I only lost my energy on it without getting anything out. But, since it was dug within my compound, I can always use the hole as a refuse pit when I want to"
45,2022-09-29,63, **Interviewer**: I have seen that you haven't covered it up..," **Interviewee**: It's a big compound and it's outside the fences, so I have no problem with it."
45,2022-09-29,64," **Interviewer**: You said you didn't line the hole, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
45,2022-09-29,65, **Interviewer**: Do you think the reactor or the pipe was imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: Everything here in Malawi is imported from South Africa, Japan or China. Even the organizations that support us are from outside the country. Of course, we have our local organizations, but they also get funds from international organizations to survive."
45,2022-09-29,66, **Interviewer**: So you think it's from another country?, **Interviewee**: Certainly.
45,2022-09-29,67," **Interviewer**: If it had worked, do you think it would have helped you to save money?"," **Interviewee**: If it was installed properly and worked, chiefs especially those who weren't given would you have learnt about it here and eventually adopted it in their villages. And, also we could have create a community team to oversee its operation and even be responsible for managing and selling the fertilizer to other people, and also telling them about the digestate. So, in the end we could have made biogas known to so many people. It would have also brought money to the community, and the same money would have been used for repairs too."
45,2022-09-29,68, **Interviewer**:What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas seems to be a good thing and we would like to have it here. But, whoever is going to bring it here again shouldn't do thing unorganized and in haste. He should do it a way that it should work and help people. So, I would be happy if someone else gets it. Or, if they decided to bring it here, I can also be happy."
45,2022-09-29,69," **Interviewer**: When you say things should not be done in an organized manner and haste, what do you mean?"," **Interviewee**: They should bring the bags, the pipes, line the hole and take us to Hippo View Lodge for training."
45,2022-09-29,70," **Interviewer**: Last one. If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I choose a solar system, so that people who sell sweet beer (thobwa) can come here to keep their drinks in a refrigerator. Also, I would like people to come here and charge their cell phones, though I don't like cell phones because they perpetuate prostitution and are affecting cultural norms and practices. Nonetheless, I would choose a solar system because I can use it for lighting, while I'm using it for business in the afternoon."
45,2022-09-29,71," **Interviewer**: Many thanks, do you have any last words?"," **Interviewee**: I'm a chief of development, so if there's any type of developmental project consider me."
45,2022-09-29,72,Understood**.** Thanks for the interview.,NA
46,2022-09-29,1,"Thanks for granting us an interview. Since, the actual beneficiary has transferred to Chingale, Zomba, and her phone is not going through. You can answer for you sister, and where you don't have an answer, let me know to move to the next question. First question, where did this digester from?", **Interviewee**: I do not know who brought here.
46,2022-09-29,2, **Interviewer**: How many people were coming?," **Interviewee**: I do not know how many people are coming, but I was just seeing people carrying manure and all that."
46,2022-09-29,3," **Interviewer**: But, you saw the visitors?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
46,2022-09-29,4, **Interviewer**: How many were they?," **Interviewee**: It was three or four people, I think."
46,2022-09-29,5, **Interviewer**: Do you know where the funds for the digester came from?," **Interviewee**: Mmmh, I do not know."
46,2022-09-29,6," **Interviewer**: Before any development project, they always say the one responsible for funding the project, and in most cases it's the government or an NGO or even member of parliament, who funded this digester?"," **Interviewee**: Mmmh, I don't know."
46,2022-09-29,7, **Interviewer**: What was your role?," **Interviewee**: We sourced cow manure and water to make feedstock, and then we fed the reactor."
46,2022-09-29,8, **Interviewer**: Did you have a cow house?, **Interviewee**: No
46,2022-09-29,9, **Interviewer**: So where did you get the manure?, **Interviewee**: We asked from different people within the community.
46,2022-09-29,10, **Interviewer**: Which houses?," **Interviewee**: We asked from that house, and we also asked from another family, but that one is very far."
46,2022-09-29,11," **Interviewer**: Let us say more than 800 meters far together. Okay, where did you get water?", **Interviewee**: There is a borehole there. It is about 100 meters away.
46,2022-09-29,12, **Interviewer**: That side where I passed by?, **Interviewee**: Let's say it is 200 meters... or 100 meters as you have said.
46,2022-09-29,13," **Interviewer**: Did people give you the cow manure for free, or you bought them?"," **Interviewee**: It's true some people ask for money. However, the people here just give out for free."
46,2022-09-29,14, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: I think they don't see value of it. In addition, people here don't really use manure as fertilizer. It's only a very few who use manure strictly as fertilizer here. So, people don't see value in it."
46,2022-09-29,15, **Interviewer**: Why don\'t people using cow dung as fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Maybe, we are not just used to it. Or, maybe we are used to inorganic fertilizers."
46,2022-09-29,16," **Interviewer**: During the time you were building it, how many people were involved?"," **Interviewee**: It was five people who were involved in sourcing and preparing feedstock, collecting water from the borehole; it was three females and two males."
46,2022-09-29,17, **Interviewer**: Did you hire people to help you?, **Interviewee**: No
46,2022-09-29,18," **Interviewer**: We have many families in this community, how were you family selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: I don\'t know what the selection process was, but I think it's because we are very poor, and they wanted to improve our livelihood."
46,2022-09-29,19, **Interviewer**: Some people have told me that there was a community meeting where community members chose the beneficiaries? What's your comment?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it's true. We had a community meeting and people were chosen there. Nevertheless, people got selected for a number of things, for instance, in our case I think we were chosen because we are poor, so they wanted our livelihood to change. Some were chosen because were hardworking and trustworthy, so people trusted them that they could manage the digester."
46,2022-09-29,20," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you know about biogas before?", **Interviewee**: We didn't know anything about biogas.
46,2022-09-29,21," **Interviewer**: On the day of choosing the beneficiaries, did you attend the meeting?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
46,2022-09-29,22," **Interviewer**: You had the right to say no. I have seen people chosen as village champions but refusing to take up the role, why did you accept it to be built here?"," **Interviewee**: We found it to be a good thing; with it, we thought we could use it for cooking as well as lighting."
46,2022-09-29,23," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were you expectations?", **Interviewee**: I basically expected to use it for cooking as well as for lighting.
46,2022-09-29,24, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: People at the community meeting were told that the beneficiaries would go for training, but it never materialized. I didn't go for training, but I don't know if others went."
46,2022-09-29,25, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the Intervention?, **Interviewee**: We used to get wood from there bushes and mountains.
46,2022-09-29,26, **Interviewer**: Where is it?, **Interviewee**: It's far
46,2022-09-29,27," **Interviewer**: If you go there at 6:00 in the morning, what time do you come back?", **Interviewee**: Maybe 2 or 3 in the afternoon.
46,2022-09-29,28, **Interviewer**: How often do you go there?, **Interviewee**: I go there four times a month.
46,2022-09-29,29, **Interviewer**: Is it for free?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
46,2022-09-29,30, **Interviewer**: What challenges do you encounter there?," **Interviewee**: It's just tiresome, as we carry heavy loads. It's very far; imagine we cross three rivers in the process."
46,2022-09-29,31, **Interviewer**: What do you call a river here?," **Interviewee**: ""Mkuwu"""
46,2022-09-29,32," **Interviewer**: I knew that you meant a river, though you didn't say it as we say it. We call it ""Mtsinje"""," **Interviewee**: (Laughs heavily) yeah, it's ""Nkuwu"" here"
46,2022-09-29,33," **Interviewer**: Oh, it's far. What about forest officials?"," **Interviewee**: We go there very early in the morning and we usually go Saturdays, and not during weekdays."
46,2022-09-29,34," **Interviewer**: You have told me had no livestock, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
46,2022-09-29,35," **Interviewer**: Were there people who had cows that time, but weren't chosen?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, lots of them."
46,2022-09-29,36, **Interviewer**: Some people who had cows were not picked in favor of people who had no cows. Why?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, people were chosen based on personality. Some people weren't given because people considered untrustworthy, so people thought they would sell it or something. Even some people who were considered rich did not get the digesters because people thought they would not value it, or would find it involving to the extent of not using it, and then continuing buying charcoal."
46,2022-09-29,37, **Interviewer**: How much manure did you start it up with?," **Interviewee**: I have forgotten how manure cow manure we used it to start it up. But, I think we use 50 buckets (20 liters) of water."
46,2022-09-29,38, **Interviewer**: That was a lot.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, if you ask anyone, who was involved in this would tell you that it was hard work. It wasn't easy to feed it the first time."
46,2022-09-29,39, **Interviewer**: I believe you heard or you saw how it worked after commissioning. How did it work after commissioning?, **Interviewee**: It never worked at all.
46,2022-09-29,40, **Interviewer**: Not even for a day?, **Interviewee**: I\'m not sure if it worked after installation. It never worked.
46,2022-09-29,41, **Interviewer**: How did you intend to use the gas?, **Interviewee**: It was cooking only.
46,2022-09-29,42, **Interviewer**: How many people were intended to use the gas?, **Interviewee**: We were six people.
46,2022-09-29,43, **Interviewer**: What were operation requirements?, **Interviewee**: It required feeding with cow manure and water.
46,2022-09-29,44, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: It was just like the first day; first we collected manure and placed it a bucket. Then, we used adding water and stir. We stirred the feedstock until the slurry was thick and smooth. After that, we used to pour the feedstock into the digester."
46,2022-09-29,45, **Interviewer**: How often did you feed it and in what quantities?, **Interviewee**: I don't remember how often we feed it.
46,2022-09-29,46, **Interviewer**: Who is responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: It was the mother and her son.
46,2022-09-29,47, **Interviewer**: What did they say about feeding it?, **Interviewee**: They said it was very tedious especially the first day.
46,2022-09-29,48, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: I don't know what the arrangement was like. But, I know that they didn't use it. I don't think people used it. It never worked."
46,2022-09-29,49, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?, **Interviewee**: She used to complain that it didn't work after all the effort she did put. I think that\`s the only challenge she had.
46,2022-09-29,50, **Interviewer**: How would describe the current state of your digester?," **Interviewee**: After sometime everything, for example, the digester bag and the pipes were taken inside to protect them from thieves."
46,2022-09-29,51," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, how did it reach this stage? Or, what caused it to fail?"," **Interviewee**: The digesters failed because the installers did not follow up the project after installation of the digesters. They just planted the digester and disappeared. So, it was hard for the people to maintain it. In addition, she found it difficult to keep the bag outside since she is woman, so she just decided to hire people too take it out."
46,2022-09-29,52, **Interviewer**: How does she meet her energy needs now that it\'s not working!, **Interviewee**: She uses firewood.
46,2022-09-29,53, **Interviewer**: Charcoal?," **Interviewee**: People who use charcoal are considered rich. Charcoal is not for everyone. People sell charcoal at K2000 a bag that doesn't even last a week. So, she uses firewood only."
46,2022-09-29,54, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: We don't know.
46,2022-09-29,55, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: We only contributed cow manure, water. The rest of the things came with the installers."
46,2022-09-29,56, **Interviewer**: Was there any masonry work that was involved?," **Interviewee**: No, the hole was simply dug without and it had no brick wall around it."
46,2022-09-29,57, **Interviewer**: What special item that had to be imported from another country?, **Interviewee**: We don't know whether it's from Malawi or not. We don't know.
46,2022-09-29,58," **Interviewer**: Okay, we are remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas?", **Interviewee**: Biogas is a good thing. It is good source of energy. It\'s good because it free. You don't need money to spend on anything.
46,2022-09-29,59," **Interviewer**: But, it never worked..."," **Interviewee**: It never worked. But, they way they explained it; one has to say biogas is good."
46,2022-09-29,60, **Interviewer**: What is it that they explained that you thought this thing is good?," **Interviewee**: The fact that it makes people without searching for firewood is very crucial. Another thing is that, you don't spend money on it since it uses things you don\`t buy, for example, cow manure."
46,2022-09-29,61, **Interviewer**: Why do you think it failed?," **Interviewee**: It failed because there was no close monitoring of the project itself; Also, they were taking long to offer support on every phase of it; they took time to come after feeding it, and they never came after installation as well. After commissioning, they were supposed to come and see how people were faring, but they never came. That's why it failed."
46,2022-09-29,62," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: Aah, I don't know, maybe a solar system because as it can be used for cooking as well as lighting. Alternatively, the installers simple need to install biogas properly, so that it can be usable. It's a good thing because it requires things that are readily available, for example, cow dung, water. Therefore, biogas is good because it is cheap, and it doesn't need money."
46,2022-09-29,63, **Interviewer**: Which alternatives need money?," **Interviewee**: Even a solar system; to maintain a solar system you need money to replace the bulbs and batteries. Moreover, it's not easy to find such things. As for Biogas, cow dung, water is always available and free."
46,2022-09-29,64," **Interviewer**: So, you would go for biogas first, but it needs to be installed in a manner that it could work. Alternatives, you would choose a solar system. Okay, thanks for the interview. And, please share her contact, so I can reach out to her and ask some specific questions."," **Interviewee**: Okay, sure. We have here number."
46,2022-09-29,65," **Interviewer**: Do so, please. Thanks.",NA
47,2022-09-30,1," **Interviewer**: Sorry for the loss of your uncle who passed on 2020. I know it is going to be difficult for you to answer the question, as you were not staying with him. But since you stayed very close to his house and interacted with him regularly. I hope you will be able to answer some of the questions. And, if you don't know the answer the question that's fine, we can always move on."," **Interviewee**: Okay, fine."
47,2022-09-30,2," **Interviewer**: First question, where did the digester originate from?"," **Interviewee**: I believe it was a non-governmental organization, but the government."
47,2022-09-30,3, **Interviewer**: I also believe that it was funded by the NGO?, **Interviewee**: Obviously.
47,2022-09-30,4, **Interviewer**: Where you around when it was being built?," **Interviewee**: No, I was not around."
47,2022-09-30,5," **Interviewer**: But, I can imagine you we told or you found out who built it? Who built it? Is it your late uncle or the installation company?"," **Interviewee**: That time when I asked him, he told me the visitors installed the digester"
47,2022-09-30,6, **Interviewer**: What was his role?," **Interviewee**: He was responsible for gathering and preparing feedstock for the digester. And, this was easy for him because he had a cow house."
47,2022-09-30,7, **Interviewer**: Some beneficiary say they were responsible for digging the hole....," **Interviewee**: That's true. He dug the hole, but the visitors placed the bag in the hole and assembled the pipes and other fittings. So, I think he was responsible for digging the hole and preparing the feedstock."
47,2022-09-30,8," **Interviewer**: In this community, we have a lot of people and a lot of households. How was he selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: My late Uncle was a very hard working person; he was not lazy in all his doings. So, I think the people who brought the digesters here thought that he would manage it, and it would reach to other people, as he was not a stingy man. You know when some people get this kind of things they always keep it to themselves and block other people from learning from them or even giving them a chance to appreciate the technology. Also, he was a very trustworthy and reliable man, and you can tell that by the simple fact that he worked with almost every non-governmental organizations, which came here for developmental projects."
47,2022-09-30,9," **Interviewer**: And as you have rightly said, he might have been chosen because he had cows, because most of the beneficiaries are chosen based on that."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, he had cows, so I think that's why he was selected."
47,2022-09-30,10, **Interviewer**: Do you know about biogas?, **Interviewee**: I know a little about it
47,2022-09-30,11, **Interviewer**: What little do you know?, **Interviewee**: I know biogas is a technology that uses biodegradable things to produce energy for cooking.
47,2022-09-30,12," **Interviewer**: Okay, what was his expectation of biogas? Or, what do you know about the uses of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: I believe he expected to use biogas for cooking, like I said, he used it for cooking. The other thing was that he had expectation of protecting the environment by stopping using firewood and charcoal for cooking... Simply put, biogas stops women from going to the mountains to search for firewood. It also stops people from making charcoal, thereby protecting the environment. I mean, you can't use firewood or buy charcoal when you have biogas. So, he expected to stop using such things for cooking, and it was beneficial to the family -- that's what I know. And when I saw all that, I thought to myself that the project implementers brought the digesters to protect and conserve the environment by stopping people from reckless cutting down of trees."
47,2022-09-30,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, what kind of training did he receive in regards to biogas?"," **Interviewee**: I think he expected to go for training, but he never went. I remember this other time, we talked and he hoped to go for training to learn one or two things about biogas. But, he did not go for training. This thing was only brought here, but not everything was completed."
47,2022-09-30,14, **Interviewer**: Did it produce fire?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it did."
47,2022-09-30,15, **Interviewer**: Did he ever cook on it?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and for a long time."
47,2022-09-30,16, **Interviewer**: Like how long?," **Interviewee**: I think it was 7 to 11 months. But, it didn't last a year."
47,2022-09-30,17," **Interviewer**: He had the right to deny the digester, but he did. Why do you think he accepted to build a digester here?"," **Interviewee**: I think he accepted to save money he was spending on a charcoal or firewood; I also think he accepted it to enable his wife to stop going to the mountains to search for firewood. On top of this, I think he accepted the digester to protect and conserve the environment."
47,2022-09-30,18, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs that time?," **Interviewee**: Bluntly speaking, the first and common means of cooking here is by firewood. This is followed by charcoal. Statistically, I can say 75% of the people here use firewood; if you go to 100 households, you would find that 70 to 75 households are using firewood, and the rest use charcoal. I'm saying this because the charcoal we use here is not made here. It\`s made in Mozambique. So, sometimes it's hard to find and it's expensive too."
47,2022-09-30,19," **Interviewer**: Oh, you get charcoal from Mozambique?"," **Interviewee**: Oh, yeah."
47,2022-09-30,20, **Interviewer**: What do yourself use?," **Interviewee**: I often use firewood. Still, sometimes I use charcoal."
47,2022-09-30,21," **Interviewer**: In 6 months, how many bags of charcoal do you buy?"," **Interviewee**: Maybe, I use two or three bags. We usually buy charcoal during the rainy season because firewood is usually wet around that time. Around this time is not common to find the people cooking using charcoal."
47,2022-09-30,22, **Interviewer**: How much is a bag of charcoal?, **Interviewee**: It's sold in range of K3000 to K5000 depending on the size.
47,2022-09-30,23, **Interviewer**: Where do you get firewood?, **Interviewee**: We get it from the mountains.
47,2022-09-30,24," **Interviewer**: I have seen a lot of mountains around this part. Everywhere you look you see a mountain, and you house is even on a foot of a mountain \[less than 50 meters\]. How often do you go there to source firewood?", **Interviewee**: We go there four times a week. It's within.
47,2022-09-30,25, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: Before that digester, he was getting the manure to the farm to be used as fertilizer."
47,2022-09-30,26, **Interviewer**: Does it work?," **Interviewee**: It works, but it takes time to work. For example, if you put the manure in the farm today, you should expect it to start working next year."
47,2022-09-30,27, **Interviewer**: How do you make it?," **Interviewee**: We collect manure from the cow house and heap it at the farm. Then, we place the manure on top of the ridge and place vegetation i.e. maize stalks on top, and then we make the ridges again onto which seeds are planted. So, when the rain comes it breaks down the manure, and it takes about a year to complete break it down. So, it takes a year or so to work as fertilizer. Though, it takes time for this method to work, it's good because it helps the soil to retain moisture, and it generally improves the soil."
47,2022-09-30,28, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commission?," **Interviewee**: I can't really say because I never got the chance to see the stove working. But, I knew that they were cooking on it, because I would hear them talking about it."
47,2022-09-30,29, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: I think it was only manure. As I said, I didn't really interact with it to know it fully."
47,2022-09-30,30, **Interviewer**: And water too?, **Interviewee**: Yeah! Water too!
47,2022-09-30,31, **Interviewer**: How did they prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: I just heard about that they mixed cow manure and water, and then feed it."
47,2022-09-30,32, **Interviewer**: Do you know how often did they feed it and in what quantities?," **Interviewee**: Hmm, I don't know."
47,2022-09-30,33, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?, **Interviewee**: That I can't know as well.
47,2022-09-30,34,"In own words, what were the challenges?"," **Interviewee**: Aah, in his own words, he mentioned that the installers didn't come back from the time they installed it. Also, that it was malfunctioning sometimes, which was hard for them to fix because they did not receive any training. Then, after sometime, the bag shrunk and that was the end of it."
47,2022-09-30,35, **Interviewer**: So one major problem was that the installers did not follow up after installation of the digester...," **Interviewee**: Yeah, for example, if they could have come after the bag shrunk, I believe they could have fixed it using the expertise."
47,2022-09-30,36, **Interviewer**: What went problem?," **Interviewee**: I don't exactly remember what it was, but he said something like the bag shrunk and it was not producing gas, and I don't know what caused it."
47,2022-09-30,37, **Interviewer**: Did he call the installers?," **Interviewee**: Yes, he did. But, they only told him that they would come to fix it and they didn't."
47,2022-09-30,38, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of digester?, **Interviewee**: I can only say that it's broken.
47,2022-09-30,39, **Interviewer**: How did it reach that state?," **Interviewee**: I can't know, but I remember I asked him about the digester and he told me that it doesn't work."
47,2022-09-30,40," **Interviewer**: It sounded to me like when you want to cook you use firewood, and you use manure as fertilizer for your crops even now, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah! Nothing has changed.
47,2022-09-30,41,We are going towards the end of the interview. Do you know how much reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't hear anything on that."
47,2022-09-30,42, **Interviewer**: Did he contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: I don't know anything about that.
47,2022-09-30,43, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: When the digester came here, we admired it. And when we heard that many people would get the digester after the first roll out, we were happy because we really admired it. We admired it because life is hard when you cooking on firewood or charcoal. And, when we look at the environment, the mountains, we feel sad because we don't know how bad things will be if we continue like this. So, if there is a solution other than biogas, then we would really appreciate it. What I want is we community people to move away from what we were told by our fathers that firewood is for cooking and start using modern methods of cooking. I remember, this other day I was passing through Namonde village in Group village Ching'ani and I saw solar panels mounted on people's houses by a certain NGO. I was so attracted, so I asked the people and they told me that 10 people were given the solar panels by a certain NGO, and they use solar panels for cooking. They went on to say they stopped using firewood and charcoal after the got the solar panels. So, if I can be given a chance to choose between biogas and solar panels, I would go for solar panels without a doubt. And, I believe that if organizations can supply the people with solar panels, I'm sure we would save the environment."
47,2022-09-30,44," **Interviewer**: If think you have touch on my next question, I wanted to ask you that if you were given an opportunity to choose or design your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: When I look at the time that my uncle used the digester, I think it's too short to be considered as an alternative to firewood. But, I think solar can work for a long time because it relies on sun, and you know the sun is ever-present (laughs).... So Personally, I would go for solar panels."
47,2022-09-30,45, **Interviewer**: Why do you think your uncle's digester didn't work for long?," **Interviewee**: I think the digester didn't work for long because project implementers did not follow up after they installed it. It is also important to give beneficiaries training regardless of what kind of technology it, so that you enable them to manage the technology. For example, if you can give me a dairy cow and leave, of course, I will accept it, but something will be missing. I will need is training, for example, I will need you to tell me what I should do to maximize milk production especially in regards to feeding. Because without that, I might be feeding it with local feed and it may fail to produce milk. And after a month or two, I might even call you to tell you that the cow is not producing milk. Then, you will ask me what I'm feeding the cow, and then you will learn that I'm not feed it accordingly and you will advise me on feeding to maximize milk production."
47,2022-09-30,46," **Interviewer**: So, it failed because the people did not receive training?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, you can't give anyone a new thing without explaining what thing is about. You need to explain what ought to be done for that thing to last long."
47,2022-09-30,47," **Interviewer**: Why do you think an organization would do that? Because when you think of an organization you think that, everything is well planned and organized. Why did this organization fail to do the training or implement this accordingly?"," **Interviewee**: It could be that they failed to come and monitor the project because of the transition of government. In my thinking, I believe change of government also affects the operation of NGO. I think governments do have special working relationship with certain organizations, so when the government goes out of power, certain organization also crumble. For example, we have seen certain projects that stopped abruptly after regime changes. I'm thinking of the livestock donation project \[a flagship program by former President, Joyce Banda\]. Once government changed, the project disappeared and even the organization that was implementing it seized to exist. We had certain organizations that were very active during the era of Peter Mutharika, but we don't see them here no more after he lost power. So, a lot of organizations have gone, and you can agree with me. It's only World Vision that has stayed here for long. I remember that time we had ADRA, it\`s no longer here. And, it does not only apply to organizations, it also applies to individuals. For example, the person you have come with, the former ADC \[Area Development Committee\] chair, he was very active in spearheading developmental projects during the time of Peter \[former president\]. But, now he's no longer active. So, I'm of the view that change of government affects operation of non-governmental organizations too."
47,2022-09-30,48, **Interviewer**: So you think certain organizations are connected to the government?," **Interviewee**: I do think so. I do believe governments have certain powers, which they use to work with certain organizations, and they choose which organization to work with. So, when the government changes, the new regime blocks certain organizations because they knew that they are attached to previously regime."
47,2022-09-30,49," **Interviewer**: What you are saying is true to some extent. I mean there was an organization called Beautiful Malawi, which was run by the former first lady. They were seen everywhere in Blantyre doing cleaning services with city council. But once they lost power, they organization couldn't be found. So, it's one of those things."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I know it. It was popular"
47,2022-09-30,50," **Interviewer**: But, when the previous regime lost power, I tried to locate them but I couldn't find it. So, yeah, it could be true. But, for the digesters and government change, it was 2 years in between them. So, we may never know if there was some politics involved. That was my last question. In closing, do you have anything to say?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know if the organization which was dealing with my uncle is still around. But if it's still there and they want to bring the digester, I would like to ... (laughs) you know something like a succession thing. Just like what has happened to England, the queen has died and her son has replaced her. So if the same can happen here with digester it cannot do anyone harm."
47,2022-09-30,51," **Interviewer**: (laughs) I get you. Thanks for the interview; I really appreciate it, brother.",NA
48,2022-10-01,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: That is a difficult one for me (laughs). The ADC chair knows a lot about it. He only told me that I was selected as a beneficiary. So, it is hard for me to say where it came from."
48,2022-10-01,2, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: From my understanding, I think it was an NGO."
48,2022-10-01,3, **Interviewer**: Which NGO?," **Interviewee**: As I said, I do not know."
48,2022-10-01,4," **Interviewer**: Okay, who built it?", **Interviewee**: It was some students from a certain University.
48,2022-10-01,5, **Interviewer**: How many were they?, **Interviewee**: They were two.
48,2022-10-01,6, **Interviewer**: I also believe that you played a part in the existence of the digester. What was your role?, **Interviewee**: I was responsible for sourcing feedstock as well as preparing it.
48,2022-10-01,7, **Interviewer**: What else? Did you take part in the building process of this?," **Interviewee**: Oh yeah, we invested a lot of things in this. We sourced water and dug the hole as well."
48,2022-10-01,8, **Interviewer**: How many people from your side dug the hole?, **Interviewee**: Four people dug the hole and one person lined it up with a brick wall.
48,2022-10-01,9, **Interviewer**: Did you pay them?," **Interviewee**: I have forgotten how much it was, but it was a lot of money because I had to push the people to do the work in a single day."
48,2022-10-01,10," **Interviewer**: We have many people in this community and many households too, how were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: I think God favored me. And, it is not like I was special or something. So, I got it through God's will."
48,2022-10-01,11," **Interviewer**: How did you meet the project implementers first time? Is it like they came here, and then discuss their business as I have done, or is it like it went through the chiefs or something?"," **Interviewee**: No, there was nothing like a community meeting at the chief's court. I think the ADC gave the names, and then the ADC chair directed them here. So, they project implementers came here pretty much as you have."
48,2022-10-01,12," **Interviewer**: When they came here, you had the right to say no. Why did you accept it to be built here?"," **Interviewee**: I accepted it with both hands and was very much interested because I took it as development, and I wanted to be part of that."
48,2022-10-01,13, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I did not know anything about biogas."
48,2022-10-01,14," **Interviewer**: So when the project implementers came, what did they say?"," **Interviewee**: They explained that it was a technology for cooking, and that it was one way of reducing the use of trees for firewood."
48,2022-10-01,15, **Interviewer**: What did you expect?," **Interviewee**: We expected our household to develop by using a modern method of cooking. We expected our life to be much easier because we thought we would stop going around searching for firewood. But, we would easily turn it on and then cook everything we wanted."
48,2022-10-01,16, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?, **Interviewee**: We did not receive any training at all.
48,2022-10-01,17," **Interviewer**: Then, how were you able to operate it or use it?", **Interviewee**: They explained to us how to operate it and we were doing just that.
48,2022-10-01,18, **Interviewer**: What did they say?," **Interviewee**: They showed us how to turn it on and off. Then, they told us how to make feedstock, and that we needed to feed it all the times to have gas, and that if we did not feed it, it would stop working. They also told us that after feeding it, it starts releasing digestate at the outlet, which could be used as fertilizer."
48,2022-10-01,19," **Interviewer**: After explaining all this to you, how prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were?"," **Interviewee**: I felt we lacked the proper skills because when it started misbehaving we were very confused and we did not know what to do. As a result, we just abandoned it when it started misbehaving."
48,2022-10-01,20, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: We used firewood and charcoal.
48,2022-10-01,21, **Interviewer**: Where did you get firewood?," **Interviewee**: My brother, firewood is very hard to find here. To get firewood we buy from the Mozambican vendors who bring it here."
48,2022-10-01,22, **Interviewer**: You have exhausted all the trees here?," **Interviewee**: Mmh, it is all gone."
48,2022-10-01,23," **Interviewer**: And, where do you get charcoal?", **Interviewee**: From the same people \[Mozambican vendors\]
48,2022-10-01,24," **Interviewer**: In a month, how much charcoal do you use?"," **Interviewee**: Brother, it is a lot of money because we use 5 or 4 bags of charcoal in a month."
48,2022-10-01,25, **Interviewer**: How much was a bag of charcoal?," **Interviewee**: It was at K2500, but if you were good at negotiating, you could buy a bag at K2, 000. But, now it is K4, 500 or K5, 000."
48,2022-10-01,26," **Interviewer**: That time when the digester came, did you have cattle or any livestock?", **Interviewee**: I had cows.
48,2022-10-01,27," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did you manage your cow manure before the intervention?", **Interviewee**: I was getting the manure to the field as fertilizer.
48,2022-10-01,28, **Interviewer**: Some people say cow manure does not work as fertilizer. What is your take?," **Interviewee**: Manure works very well as fertilizer. And, it even retains soil moist that even in dry spell the maize do well. So, personally, I think it is good, and it is obviously better than not applying any type of fertilizer."
48,2022-10-01,29, **Interviewer**: How do you process your manure?," **Interviewee**: We do it two ways; if we are kind of feeling lazy, we just dig holes and place the manure soon after making the ridges; if we have time, we place the manure between the ridges after harvesting. Then, after sometime, we go make ridges on where we placed manure, thereby burying the manure under the new ridge."
48,2022-10-01,30," **Interviewer**: Okay, let us talk about how it worked. Before commissioning your digester, I believe they asked you to make feedstock and then feed it. How much feedstock did you start it with?"," **Interviewee**: Mm-hmm, I have forgotten but they advised us to feed it with a certain amount. But, it was a lot because the work we did that was very, very heavy -- it was a lot of work."
48,2022-10-01,31, **Interviewer**: Did you hire people to do the work?," **Interviewee**: We hired people but some quitted because they found the smell of the manure too much. Then, we just forced ourselves to do it. But it was a lot of work and many bags of manure."
48,2022-10-01,32, **Interviewer**: Was it 2 bags or 3 bags?, **Interviewee**: It was more than that. I think it was 8 bags (50kg) of fresh cow manure.
48,2022-10-01,33, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the manure?, **Interviewee**: I got all of it from my cow house.
48,2022-10-01,34, **Interviewer**: You didn't go around asking or buying cow manure?, **Interviewee**: I did not ask from anyone.
48,2022-10-01,35, **Interviewer**: You must have had a lot of cows.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I had a lot of cows. I think I had 13 cows that time."
48,2022-10-01,36," **Interviewer**: Okay, where did you get the water?", **Interviewee**: I got it from the borehole somewhere there.
48,2022-10-01,37, **Interviewer**: Is it not far?, **Interviewee**: It is right after that tree.
48,2022-10-01,38," **Interviewer**: Oh, it is not far. That is like 200 meters. How much water did you use to start it up?", **Interviewee**: I have just forgotten. I think we used a drum (200 liters) of water.
48,2022-10-01,39, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up?," **Interviewee**: It did not take long. I believe, after we fed it we waited for 2 days."
48,2022-10-01,40," **Interviewer**: So after two days, when you turned the stove on, you saw the fire?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it worked quite well. I recall we managed to cook pigeon peas on it that day."
48,2022-10-01,41, **Interviewer**: Nsima?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we did also cook nsima \[30 --45 minutes\]"
48,2022-10-01,42, **Interviewer**: How did it work on the second day?," **Interviewee**: After the first day, we wereable to cook side dish of fish and others, but we could not cook nsima on it because my wife thought the digester was not producing strong fire. So, after the first day, we were basically cooking light side dishes and boiling water \[30 -- 45\] minutes) for the school going kids in the morning."
48,2022-10-01,43, **Interviewer**: How long did you use it?," **Interviewee**: We used it for 4 months. After 4 months, it was producing very little fire, so my wife stopped using it."
48,2022-10-01,44," **Interviewer**: In the 4 months, it worked were you using biogas only?"," **Interviewee**: No, especially in the evening when she wanted to cook things fast she was combining biogas and charcoal."
48,2022-10-01,45," **Interviewer**: Oh, the biogas had one burner?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it had one burner, and the gas was very weak."
48,2022-10-01,46, **Interviewer**: How many people were you in your household?, **Interviewee**: We were 7 people.
48,2022-10-01,47, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?, **Interviewee**: They simply told us to feed it with 20 kg of cow manure and one bucket (20 liters) of water every day.
48,2022-10-01,48, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We were placing manure in a bucket, add water, and then mix with a stick. But, most times, we used hands because it was easier to break the lumps and to remove trash. After thoroughly mixing feedstock, we used to pour the mixture in the digester bag."
48,2022-10-01,49, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about preparing feedstock? Didn't you feel that it was gross or tiresome?," **Interviewee**: We are used to handling cow manure since we are cow farmer. Also, we were very keen on trying to make the digester work, so that we could save money."
48,2022-10-01,50, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: When I was around I was feeding it. My wife was also feeding it. Both of us knew how to make feedstock and how to feed it.
48,2022-10-01,51, **Interviewer**: Do you think making feedstock was worth getting the fire you were getting?," **Interviewee**: We did not find feeding the digester hard because cow manure was withinthe house. So, everything was good."
48,2022-10-01,52, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: They just gave us their numbers to call when there was a fault. So, when it malfunctioned, I called thembut the line did not go through. Then, I called the installers again after a week and the line could not be reached, so I just gave up."
48,2022-10-01,53," **Interviewer**: Since it was installed, did they ever come back?"," **Interviewee**: After commissioning, it they did not come back."
48,2022-10-01,54, **Interviewer**: Not even once?, **Interviewee**: Never!
48,2022-10-01,55, **Interviewer**: Did it meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: We were satisfied with its performance especially because we knew for sure that we would use it for cooking even when we came home late from the field. But even then, we were still using conventional methods of cooking in combination with it."
48,2022-10-01,56, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: The main problem was that it was not producing strong fire for a long time.The other challenge is that our children liked to play with the gas pipe when we were not around. One time, they even sliced it. So, it was difficult for us to monitor it because we could not stay around all the time -- thus, the challenges we faced with it."
48,2022-10-01,57, **Interviewer**: Did your children reach a point of cutting the pipe completely?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. Yeah! It happened. You know childrenare always attracted to new things. So, one day out of curiosity they tried to play with the pipes and ended up cutting the pipe."
48,2022-10-01,58, **Interviewer**: What did you do after that?," **Interviewee**: Eh, you cannot just understand children, sometimes you wonder what really goes in their mind. Going back to your question, when that happened, I sealed the pipe."
48,2022-10-01,59, **Interviewer**: With what?, **Interviewee**: With seal tape.
48,2022-10-01,60, **Interviewer**: What was the first problem you encountered?, **Interviewee**: It stopped producing strong fire for long.
48,2022-10-01,61," **Interviewer**: After your own analysis, what was the problem?"," **Interviewee**: I do not know and I did not try to find out. But my thinking was that maybe it was not made to last long, and that it had reached it expiry date. So, we just accepted it --we just thought that they were trying it out."
48,2022-10-01,62, **Interviewer**: You thought they were here to experiment the digesters?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I thought it was an experiment to see if the digesters could help people -- Or, maybe they just wanted to see if the digesters would produce fire or something like that."
48,2022-10-01,63, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: The project implementers explained to us that it was like it was a pilot project, like they just wanted to try out the digesters. I do not really remember, but they explained something like that."
48,2022-10-01,64," **Interviewer**: Between the children cutting the pipe and starting to lose its efficiency, which started first?"," **Interviewee**: It lost its efficiency after the second day of using it, I don't know why. But, when the pipe was cut by the children it reduced its efficiency slightly too. I cannot just figure why the children cut the pipe. But, after I sealed the cut with seal tape, it worked quite okay. So after some time it started producing fire for a short time then I just thought that the digester was not meant to last long. Like I said, it was just a try out."
48,2022-10-01,65," **Interviewer**: How long did it take the children to cut it? Or, after it was installed, how long did it take you to notice that that it was cut?", **Interviewee**: I think it was 2 or 3 months after it was installed.
48,2022-10-01,66, **Interviewer**: How did you find out that it was cut?," **Interviewee**: One of the children told us. And, even when we switched on the digester, it produced flame for some seconds and stop. But, the children told us before we tried it."
48,2022-10-01,67, **Interviewer**: Did you check the place where you sealed with tape when it started producing little fire?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we checked and it looked fine. And, there was no hissing sound on that part as if gas was leaking out."
48,2022-10-01,68," **Interviewer**: And, that is when you called them?", **Interviewee**: I called him but his number could not be reached.
48,2022-10-01,69, **Interviewer**: So you mean you have never talked to them after it was installed?," **Interviewee**: I talked to someone on the phone, but I do not know if it was you or not. It was a month ago, I think. I was asked about my location and the directions. So, I do not know if it was you."
48,2022-10-01,70, **Interviewer**: (laughs) sounds like me.," **Interviewee**: (Laughs heavily) yeah, you must be the one."
48,2022-10-01,71, **Interviewer**: (laughs) yeah it must be me. I think it was when I was trying to establish your location.," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) yeah, you were like, if I drop at \[location redacted\], how should I proceed."
48,2022-10-01,72," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Yeah, yeah. Moving on, were you given something like this? What do you think of this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?", **Interviewee**: That would have done us good.
48,2022-10-01,73, **Interviewer**: How?," **Interviewee**: It would have helped us a lot because whenever we had a problem we would have consulted this information. The problem is that the installers just explained things and left. So, when we had the problem, we did not know how to respond and eventually we just left it."
48,2022-10-01,74," **Interviewer**: And, they didn't talk about maintenance issues?", **Interviewee**: They did not discuss that.
48,2022-10-01,75," **Interviewer**: If the installers call you today to find out about the digester, what would you say? I mean, how would you describe the current state of your digester today?", **Interviewee**: I would tell them straight that I abandoned the digester and removed the bag after it stopped working.
48,2022-10-01,76," **Interviewer**: So after 4 months it started producing little fire, so how long did you try to feed it after that?"," **Interviewee**: When it started producing little fire, we also slowed down. I mean, we would go two or three days without feeding because we did not see a point of feeding it daily when it was not helping us. And even when we told the children to prepare feed, they started refusing saying that it was pointless."
48,2022-10-01,77," **Interviewer**: We have talked a lot and we have tackled many issues. How did it reach this stage, and in your opinion what caused it?"," **Interviewee**: That I do not know, maybe the installers would know.It needs someone who is conversant with it to deduce what caused it to fail. But, I do not think we are the cause of its failure because we fed it as we were advised -- so, I cannot know and I do not know what caused it to fail."
48,2022-10-01,78," **Interviewer**: So, I should see from a perspective that it was a try out and that the people who made it were mere students as you have said?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that is the thing."
48,2022-10-01,79," **Interviewer**: Okay, how much did the reactor cost?"," **Interviewee**: They said it was worth K450, 000. I recall I asked the installer how much I would get it on the counter and he said K450, 000."
48,2022-10-01,80," **Interviewer**: Who paid that K450, 000?", **Interviewee**: I do not know if it was the government or someone else - I do not know.
48,2022-10-01,81, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: It is only cow manure and water.
48,2022-10-01,82, **Interviewer**: It also looks like the hole was lined with a brick wall?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I provided bricks as well."
48,2022-10-01,83, **Interviewer**: Cement?, **Interviewee**: It was little -- We only lined the top of the hole. I think used half a bag of cement.
48,2022-10-01,84, **Interviewer**: Did you do that or you hired a builder?, **Interviewee**: We hired a builder.
48,2022-10-01,85, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay?, **Interviewee**: I have forgotten it has been long.
48,2022-10-01,86, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?, **Interviewee**: I did not ask them so I do not know.
48,2022-10-01,87, **Interviewer**: What do you think? Do you think it is from Malawi?, **Interviewee**: It is astonishing to see how Malawi has changed. I cannot be surprised to hear that it is from Malawi.
48,2022-10-01,88, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) did the digester save you any money that time you used it?," **Interviewee**: It helped us because we stopped buying firewood, and we were only buying one bag of charcoal in a month."
48,2022-10-01,89, **Interviewer**: Can you quantify how much were saving?," **Interviewee**: It is hard to know how much we were saving. But, we knew that we were saving money."
48,2022-10-01,90," **Interviewer**: Oh yeah, after seeing that you were not buying firewood and all that. What was the biggest change in your life in the time you had biogas?"," **Interviewee**: When a house gets a new thing there is always change. Our lives changed and it felt like we were living in luxury. It was fast. Though, we had to work hard to make feedstock, but there was a big change"
48,2022-10-01,91, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I would like just to get a chance to question the installers. I would like to ask the installers what is the guarantee of biogas. Who was responsible for fixing it? If it was them, why did they not come again? If it was us, how did they expect us to fix it without training? I have always wanted to ask the installers these questions (laughs)."
48,2022-10-01,92," **Interviewer**: Oh, it was tough. Do you think it has a future?"," **Interviewee**: It can have a future only if the installers are close to the users, so that they can do the maintenance work."
48,2022-10-01,93," **Interviewer**: And, maybe a proper training would help. If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?", **Interviewee**: I would like to see this community get electricity.
48,2022-10-01,94," **Interviewer**: When you want to cook with electricity, you need a cooker, and you have to be prepared to pay bills. Do you think you can manage that? Can't we see you going to the mountains to source firewood or buying firewood from Mozambicans because of buying electricity?", **Interviewee**: (laughs) we can do our best to make it work -- that is what I can say.
48,2022-10-01,95," **Interviewer**: In closing, what are your last words?"," **Interviewee**: I feel like I have some unfinished business with biogas. And, I need a deep conversation with the project installers so we can talk serious about the whole project and their conduct. You are only interviewing me about my experiences with it, but I want the people who installed the digester here, so I can have a few choice words for them (laughs) -- and maybe then I can hear from them and they could understand me as well."
48,2022-10-01,96, **Interviewer**: Are you angry with them?, **Interviewee**: (laughs) I just want them to explain what did they brought here? What were we supposed to do when it malfunctioned? How could they give us the digester and leave? What did they expect us to do?
48,2022-10-01,97, **Interviewer**: Why didn't you ask them about maintenance that time?," **Interviewee**: We thought that they would be coming, but after they left, they never came back."
48,2022-10-01,98," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. Thanks for the interview."," **Interviewee**: Thanks too. I really appreciate you coming. And, please share our message to the bosses. And, I think plea for us that when there is a project of this nature, they should not miss out trainings because it is so important to sustainability of innovations."
49,2022-10-01,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?, **Interviewee**: We don't know exactly where come from. We just saw \[name redacted\] \[Then Area Development Chair\] coming with certain people.
49,2022-10-01,2, **Interviewer**: Who designed it?, **Interviewee**: It must be the same people.
49,2022-10-01,3, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: We didn't ask who provided the money (laughs). We just saw that our grandparent had received a digester, and we just accepted it. So, we don't know whether the money came from the government or from a private institution."
49,2022-10-01,4, **Interviewer**: Who built it?, **Interviewee**: It was the people who came with \[name redacted\].
49,2022-10-01,5, **Interviewer**: How many were they?," **Interviewee**: They were at two, but I remember very well the lady called \[name redacted\]. She was more active than the other."
49,2022-10-01,6, **Interviewer**: When was it built?, **Interviewee**: I have forgotten.
49,2022-10-01,7," **Interviewer**: I can imagine that you also help the two installers in building the digester, for example, digging of the hole..."," **Interviewee**: Yes, and we hired some people to dig it according to the advise they gave us."
49,2022-10-01,8, **Interviewer**: What was the advice?," **Interviewee**: They gave us dimensions of the hole. I can\`t remember the dimension though. But, they told us to make the hole round kind of."
49,2022-10-01,9, **Interviewer**: How many people did you hire and how much did you pay them?," **Interviewee**: We hired four people, and we paid them for K4500 in total."
49,2022-10-01,10, **Interviewer**: How long did it take them to dig?, **Interviewee**: It took them two days.
49,2022-10-01,11, **Interviewer**: How long did it take them to come and install the bag after you dug the hole?," **Interviewee**: It took a little bit of time, because even the hole started to be covered with soil again. So, when they came we had to dig it up again."
49,2022-10-01,12, **Interviewer**: How long was that?, **Interviewee**: I think they came back after 3 or 4 weeks.
49,2022-10-01,13, **Interviewer**: What was your role?," **Interviewee**: We were responsible for digging the hole, and also for sourcing cow manure for feeding it."
49,2022-10-01,14, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the cow manure?, **Interviewee**: We got it from our cow house.
49,2022-10-01,15, **Interviewer**: How many cows did you have that time?, **Interviewee**: We had 15 cows.
49,2022-10-01,16, **Interviewer**: So you are saying all the cow manure you used to start it up came from you cow house?," **Interviewee**: Yes, we got all the manure from our cow house."
49,2022-10-01,17, **Interviewer**: How much cow manure did you start it up with?," **Interviewee**: I have forgotten how much it was, but I remember that we sourced the quantity of cow manure we were asked."
49,2022-10-01,18," **Interviewer**: Most people use 3, 4 or even 10 bags of cow manure, could you remember how much it was?"," **Interviewee**: It must be around that because I recall when we didn't get enough manure from my Grandma's cow house, we got some from my cow house."
49,2022-10-01,19," **Interviewer**: How many bags did you get from your cow house? And, how many cows did you have?", **Interviewee**: I don't remember how much I got from my cow house. I only remember that we reach the quantity we were told to find.
49,2022-10-01,20," **Interviewer**: Okay, how many cows did you have?", **Interviewee**: I had 12 cows.
49,2022-10-01,21, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: We got it from the borehole.
49,2022-10-01,22, **Interviewer**: Where is it?, **Interviewee**: It's just right there (less than 100 meters).
49,2022-10-01,23," **Interviewer**: And you house is less than 100 meters as well. Nice. Okay right. In this community, we have a lot of people and many households, how were you chosen as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: They chose us because they wanted an elderly person who had cows, so that the person wouldn't need to go to the mountains to search firewood for cooking. Thus, my grandmother met you those requirements."
49,2022-10-01,24," **Interviewer**: So, what was the selection process? Is it like there was a meeting or something? What was the selection process?"," **Interviewee**: I think the Village Development Committee (VDC) identified and chose us because \[name redacted\] was there when the two installers came. I mean, the first time they came here they were three including \[name redacted\]. I said two in the first place because I took \[name redacted\] as one of us."
49,2022-10-01,25," **Interviewer**: So, the first time they came what did they say? I mean when I came here I introduced myself as a researcher from Poly, and that I'm doing a research on biogas. What did they say the first time you met them?"," **Interviewee**: The first time they came, they said that they had come after liaising with the village development committee to give the digester to an elderly person who had cows in order to help that particular person in terms of cooking. So, they continued to say that they had come because the village development had chosen our grandmother as a beneficiary, and they would come back to install that. But, before that, they asked if we were interested to get the digester. We told them that we had accepted it, and we would manage to take care of it."
49,2022-10-01,26," **Interviewer**: Well explained. So, you had a chance to say, no. I mean, it wasn't mandatory, why did you accept it to build it here?"," **Interviewee**: We accepted it because our grandmother is very old and we expected it to help her in terms of cooking. As you can, she's old so go around searching for firewood. So, basically, we accepted it because of that, and we were very happy about it."
49,2022-10-01,27, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas?, **Interviewee**: We didn't know anything about biogas.
49,2022-10-01,28, **Interviewer**: So you became aware of biogas when the two installers came with \[name redacted\]?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they told us that it produce biogas out of cow manure. They advised us how to make cow manure and we made it, but it just didn't work when we commissioned it. Then, we called them and they were simply saying that they would come, up to now they haven't come. After some time, the cows started trampling over it -- So, we didn't see anything good about it (laughs)."
49,2022-10-01,29, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: We expected our grandmother to use it and to make life easier for her. We expected her to use it for warming water, cooking nsima, - so we expected it to help her, and we really thought that it was a good thing."
49,2022-10-01,30," **Interviewer**: I can imagine that you were told that you would be using it for cooking, apart from that, what else did the installers tell you to expect?"," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't tell us anything."
49,2022-10-01,31, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that you could use it as a source of fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they said that."
49,2022-10-01,32, **Interviewer**: What did they say?," **Interviewee**: I just remember that they said something like that, but I can't really recall because we never used it. I can't really say if they said that after the manure is used in the reactor, it comes out of the outlet as fertilizer."
49,2022-10-01,33," **Interviewer**: Okay, I get you. Did they tell you anything about using it for lighting?"," **Interviewee**: No. Did they tell you about light? \[Asks the grandmother and 2 little children around\] -- No, they didn't."
49,2022-10-01,34," **Interviewer**: Mom, they just told you about using it for cooking?", **Interviewee2**: They just told me about cooking -- They didn't mention anything about lighting at all.
49,2022-10-01,35," **Interviewer**: Okay, what kind of training did you receive?"," **Interviewee**: They didn't give us any type of training -- zero! They were just instructing us to do this and that --And, it never worked! (Laughs)"
49,2022-10-01,36," **Interviewer**: Mom, did you go for training?", **Interviewee2**: No.
49,2022-10-01,37," **Interviewer**: Then, how were you supposed to operate it?", **Interviewee**: They just showed us the button for switching it on and off (laughs).
49,2022-10-01,38, **Interviewer**: (laughs) what else?, **Interviewee**: Nothing -- there was no training (laughs)
49,2022-10-01,39," **Interviewer**: I can also imagine that they told you how to prepare feedstock, right?", **Interviewee**: I think they did.
49,2022-10-01,40," **Interviewer**: You are saying you didn't receive training, but they just told you one or two things. How prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were?"," **Interviewee**: The installers came here with the digester, so it wasn't for us to ask them what kind of training we wanted. But, personally, I felt like the training wasn't enough, and that we needed proper training. It's a shame they did things in haste and left. And, when we called them they were just saying that would come but they didn't come even up to now."
49,2022-10-01,41, **Interviewer**: Why do you say there was need for a proper training?," **Interviewee**: It was very necessary for us to know how it works, how to operate and maintain it. They should have let us know how it works out to use it for lighting and as a source of fertilizer. They should have told us all these things so that we would have became conversant with it, and even make it more appealing. What happened here is like they had a project somewhere else, which had phased out, but still had some digesters left in their stores. So, they just decided to dump the digesters here to clean up there storeroom and finish everything (laughs)."
49,2022-10-01,42," **Interviewer**: (laughs) so, they brought it here as a dumping place. How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?", **Interviewee**: The mountains you are seeing are our source of energy for cooking (laughs)
49,2022-10-01,43, **Interviewer**: You used firewood?, **Interviewee**: Yes. We buy it at market. People from Mozambique bring the firewood here.
49,2022-10-01,44," **Interviewer**: In a month, how much firewood do you use or buy?"," **Interviewee**: We buy firewood everyday at K300. So, multiplying that by 30 days, that's like we spend K9000 on firewood."
49,2022-10-01,45," **Interviewer**: So, it's a must to buy firewood everyday for you to eat?", **Interviewee**: Exactly!
49,2022-10-01,46," **Interviewer**: I'm seeing mountains close by, I'm also seeing trees around, and you have young girls around. Why don\`t they fetch firewood?", **Interviewee**: We are trying to protect our trees -- that's why we buy the firewood from Mozambique (laughs)
49,2022-10-01,47, **Interviewer**: You want to destroy the environment in Mozambique?," **Interviewee**: They are bringing firewood here, so in trying to protect the environment here, we buy them."
49,2022-10-01,48, **Interviewer**: Do we have forest officials in the mountains?, **Interviewee**:Yes! (Yes!) \[Young girl voice in the background agreeing too\]
49,2022-10-01,49, **Interviewer**: Is it true to say that you don\'t go to the mountains because we have forest officials there?, **Interviewee**: Not necessarily. We realize that it's not good to destroy the environment.
49,2022-10-01,50," **Interviewer**: But then the earth is one, the environment is one -- so, why do you want to destroy the environment in Mozambique?"," **Interviewee**: Maybe they don't have forest officials there to look after the trees in the mountains, so they just cut it anyhow, and we only buy from them for us to cook."
49,2022-10-01,51, **Interviewer**: You have said you had cows that time and you still have the cows. How did you manage your feedstock i.e. cow manure before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: We were doing what we are doing now. We gather manure from the cow house, and then apply it our fields."
49,2022-10-01,52," **Interviewer**: Some people are saying is not a goods fertilizer? What's your take? And, how do you use your manure?"," **Interviewee**: It helps. And, this is how we make our manure as fertilizer; first, we dig a hole not more than 1 meter deep, then we put maize stalks, cow manure, ash, and then add water in the pit. Then, we start another layer by starting with maize stalk, then place cow manure and ash; afterwards we add water again, so on until we fill the pit. So, after three months, we find the feedstock completely broken down, and that's when it can be used as fertilizer."
49,2022-10-01,53," **Interviewer**: Let's talk how it worked at the commission. You have told me that at first, you were told to feed it up with cow manure, and you did. How long did it take to start it up?"," **Interviewee**: Like I said, it didn't produce fire. After we fed it with feedstock, it didn't produce fire."
49,2022-10-01,54," **Interviewer**: (laughs) Ah, that's not true"," **Interviewee**: That's what happened. We called them to come and see that it wasn't producing fire after we did everything. Then, we reported to \[name redacted\], and he was like he would consult them. But, up to now, they haven't come and it's just there. And, we didn't even use it for a day."
49,2022-10-01,55, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to feed it the very first time and then try to start it up?," **Interviewee**: I don't know how long it was. But, we waited the same number of days as we were told. They gave us a specific day to commission it, and we tried to commission it on that particular day."
49,2022-10-01,56," **Interviewer**: I know it's been long, so to freshen up your memory was it after 3 days, a week or a month?"," **Interviewee**: I will give you wrong information, but what I know is that we tried to commission it on the day we were told."
49,2022-10-01,57, **Interviewer**: So you did what you were told and it didn\'t produce fire?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. We called them and they were like they would come, but didn't."
49,2022-10-01,58, **Interviewer**: You didn't see even the smallest of fire on the burners?, **Interviewee**: We don\'t know how biogas fire looks like (laughs). We were just surprised that Mr. Msothi told us that his digester was working that time.
49,2022-10-01,59, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: It's been a long time, but I can only remember that the bag was supposed to be fed with cow manure and water."
49,2022-10-01,60," **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock? Or, how was the feedstock supposed to be made?"," **Interviewee**: I recall that they told us, but like I have said, it's been quite a long time. Plus, when we saw that it wasn't working, we only fed it for a very short time, so that makes it even harder to remember. And, it's sad that they acted like they simply wanted to abandon it here. After installation, they should have called to follow up, and even when we called them, they should have at least called back. They were just not serious, so we just abandoned."
49,2022-10-01,61, **Interviewer**: How did you make the first feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We placed cow manure in a bucket, add water, and then stirred it with a stick, I believe. After we made the slurry, we fed the bag."
49,2022-10-01,62," **Interviewer**: When you talk of feeding digester, you feed it the first time with huge amount of feedstock, and then you feed it with less amount of feedstock, but regularly. So, after feeding it the first thing, how much were you supposed to feed the digester, and how often?"," **Interviewee**: Mm-hmm I have forgotten, but I recall that we were told to feed it with huge amount of feedstock at first, and then less afterwards. I have forgotten if it was 2 or 3 buckets of cow manure."
49,2022-10-01,63, **Interviewer**: How long did you fed it after it failed to work?," **Interviewee**: I'm not quite sure, but I think it was 2 months. After we saw that fire was not coming, then we just stopped."
49,2022-10-01,64, **Interviewer**: Were you feeding it daily?," **Interviewee**: It wasn't like we were feeding it daily. They gave us specify days to feed in a week, and we were doing that. So, we don't know if the digester was wrongly installed - We just don't know."
49,2022-10-01,65, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: I was responsible.
49,2022-10-01,66, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the task of feeding a digester?," **Interviewee**: It was okay -- there were no real issues. It was okay, and it wasn't like it was a tough job."
49,2022-10-01,67," **Interviewer**: People say it's a gross to handle manure; some don't like the smell, what's your take?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) those people who complain about that don't have cow houses, and they don't use cow manure as fertilizer in their fields."
49,2022-10-01,68," **Interviewer**: Oh, more like you get used to it. What were the maintenance requirements?", **Interviewee**: They told us that they would be coming for any problem.
49,2022-10-01,69," **Interviewer**: And, they didn't even come?", **Interviewee**: Not once.
49,2022-10-01,70," **Interviewer**: After you tried to commission it and failed, how long did it take you to reach out to them? And, who did you reach out to?"," **Interviewee**: At first, I called \[name redacted\] and he told me that he would inform the installers. Then, luck enough, Faith gave me her number as well. So, I called her and she was like \[name redacted\] had informed her too, and then she was like they would come. Then, I was calling her to follow up and she was always like they would come at some point. After two months, I called her again and she was they were going to come. Then, I just stopped calling to bother her about the digester. After some time our cows fought around the digester, and damages it."
49,2022-10-01,71, **Interviewer**: When was that?," **Interviewee**: It was after some months, close to year after it was installed."
49,2022-10-01,72, **Interviewer**: Did you ever try to fix it yourself?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) No. I mean, we knew nothing about it. So, we could have made the problem worse, if we had tried to fix it."
49,2022-10-01,73, **Interviewer**: (laughs) what were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: Most of the challenges, I have already mentioned. The first is that it did not working after doing all the hard work. We did everything we were told, but it just didn't work. The other thing is that we wasted money in hiring people to dig it. We were spending all that money because we thought we were going to get help, but we didn't get any help. So, those were the two challenges."
49,2022-10-01,74, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this \[table of intervention\]?, **Interviewee**: No.
49,2022-10-01,75, **Interviewer**: What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?, **Interviewee**: It would have help because we could have been using it to understand what was wrong about the digester.
49,2022-10-01,76, **Interviewer**: Then what?," **Interviewee**: Then, we could have been acting according to the information given, thereby solving the issues."
49,2022-10-01,77," **Interviewer**: If Faith calls you today to find out about the digester, what would you say to her? I mean, what is the current state of your digester?"," **Interviewee**: I would tell her what I told her that time the digester was not working. Then, l would tell her that at some point cows fought on it and damaged it. But, we still have some of the equipment and we don't know if it call be fixed or not. So, it's basically not working as we told you that time."
49,2022-10-01,78," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, what cause it to reach this stage?"," **Interviewee**: The problem is that it did not work from the start. So, everything went astray after that. But, I don't know if the problem was the reactor, the stove or what. I can't know."
49,2022-10-01,79," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, why didn't they come back?"," **Interviewee**: That I don't know, but I personally think the project was phasing out somewhere, so they wanted to dispose of the digesters. I believe, if the project wasn't phasing out, they would have come when we called them or even by themselves. So, they just wanted to sign off everything that they had used all the resources that were given to them (laughs)"
49,2022-10-01,80," **Interviewer**: (laughs) It's like you were calling them on 2^nd^ October or in November, when the project had phased out on 1^st^ October, would they come? For what? (Laughs). Now, when you want to cook is what what I've seen, you buy firewood from Mozambique?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and sometimes they bring charcoal and they place their charcoals at the corner there as you are entering the market place."
49,2022-10-01,81," **Interviewer**: You're not from Mozambique, right?", **Interviewee**: It's very close. Mozambique is behind that mountain.
49,2022-10-01,82," **Interviewer**: Oh, it's very close. That's like 400 meters away.", **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
49,2022-10-01,83," **Interviewer**: Let's talk about the cow manure, how do you manage it now? Do you still use it as fertilizer?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we still use it fertilizer. As you can see, we have taken it out to make manure. Instead of using it for biogas, it's just staying there for nothing."
49,2022-10-01,84, **Interviewer**: Sad! We are going to towards the end of the interview. How much did reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: I don't know, they didn't inform us."
49,2022-10-01,85, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: No, we only spent money on people who dug the hole. And, we also gave them lunch that day."
49,2022-10-01,86," **Interviewer**: Oh, you gave them lunch. So, \[name redacted\] ate chicken that day?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs heavily) yeah, we gave them a good meal. I don't know if it was fish or something. But, it was a good meal."
49,2022-10-01,87," **Interviewer**: and after giving them a good meal, nothing good came out of it..."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but we are not bitter about that because it wasn't mandatory to give them food. We just did that out of good faith. It only hurts me that I spent my money to pay the hired laborers to dig the hole."
49,2022-10-01,88," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. Was it there any masonry work involved? Or, did you line the hole?", **Interviewee**: No.
49,2022-10-01,89, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that it needs lining?, **Interviewee**: We just dug the hole. And they didn't tell us anything about lining the hole.
49,2022-10-01,90," **Interviewer**: Was there any other work you did apart from sourcing manure, preparing feedstock and digging the whole?"," **Interviewee**: No, that was all."
49,2022-10-01,91, **Interviewer**: What special items have to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: I think it's from Malawi. I don't see anything special about it (laughs). But, I don't know."
49,2022-10-01,92," **Interviewer**: Let's suppose it was working okay, do you think it would have helped you to save money?"," **Interviewee**: The way they explained it to us, yes, it would have helped us a lot."
49,2022-10-01,93, **Interviewer**: What did they say?," **Interviewee**: They said after installation we would not go around searching for firewood or charcoal. So, when we heard that we were like this is it, and that's when we committed ourselves to sourcing and preparing feedstock because we expected to benefit from it."
49,2022-10-01,94," **Interviewer**: Okay, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Personally, I would like the project implementers to come again and fix the digester even though we have lost some of the equipment, likes the green and white bottles. So, if it comes again, I believe it would give us an opportunity to stop using firewood and charcoal. I mean, the way they explained it, I don't think when you have it you can't go around looking for firewood and charcoal. The other thing is that they told us that once you have it you could not go buy fertilizer because it produces digestate that can be used as fertilizer. So, I would like them come again and give us a digester."
49,2022-10-01,95, **Interviewer**: Do you think \[name redacted\] would ever come back?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) I don't know, but I doubt. However, we are not only limited to \[name redacted\], so if there are other organizations who do the same they are most welcome."
49,2022-10-01,96, **Interviewer**: Why do you doubt that \[name redacted\] would come back?," **Interviewee**: Ah, they can't come back. I called them plenty of times, but they didn't come."
49,2022-10-01,97, **Interviewer**: Like how many times did you call them?," **Interviewee**: Even if you can ask her, she would tell you that we called plenty of times, and we then gave up. And even the last time I called her, I told her that that was my last time to call her (laughs)"
49,2022-10-01,98," **Interviewer**: (laughs) And, what did she say?"," **Interviewee**: She said that I shouldn't lose hope, and that they would come some day... But, what they did was not right, and we feel bitter about them. And, if you know they are still around or if you ever come across them, tell them we feel very bitter about them and that we didn't see any thing good about biogas - tell them they just abused us for nothing."
49,2022-10-01,99, **Interviewer**: It's a lot of people who feel that way too., **Interviewee**: Oh really? I thought it was only me.
49,2022-10-01,100, **Interviewer**: Do you think biogas has the future in Malawi? Do you think it can work?, **Interviewee**: Yes!
49,2022-10-01,101, **Interviewer**: How?," **Interviewee**: First, they need to make the things work, and I think if the digesters could work, then they would help us a lot because we would stop buying firewood and eventually we can conserve the environment. I believe if we could stop buying them firewood, then they would be forced to stop cutting trees, and then we could save the environment."
49,2022-10-01,102," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own energy or waste intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: The problem is that we don't have electricity in this community, if we had I would have loved to have an electric stove -- We want that and it can help us a lot too."
49,2022-10-01,103, **Interviewer**: What else?," **Interviewee**: Some people use coal, I don't know if it's coal, but we hear on the radio that it's helpful."
49,2022-10-01,104," **Interviewer**: Yeah, there are a lot of alternatives. We have things like solar panels"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that's the one. Some people in Namonde Village have been given solar panels, which they are using for cooking and lighting. I was there yesterday, and when I saw that, I was really impressed. So, I would like to see people cooking using solar panels here. And, I think solar technology is better than biogas because you also get lighting from it, and it's not involving too."
49,2022-10-01,105," **Interviewer**: Yeah, even with biogas you can use it as a source of light too, if it's properly done."," **Interviewee**: Oh, nice. It's really nice to see them using the solar panels to use it for lighting. They gave them small torches but very powerful. You can light the torch here and use the light at the market (50 -- 100 meters)."
49,2022-10-01,106," **Interviewer**: Oh, impressive. Before wrapping up do you have any last words?"," **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming. I'm if get achance to meet the project implementers, please thank them for us for the digester, and inform them that the digesters didn'twork. And, if possible ask them to bring solar panels next time, and not digesters, then in that way we can benefit."
49,2022-10-01,107, **Interviewer**: So you don't want biogas?, **Interviewee**: We didn't see any benefit of biogas! (Laughs) please share the message that we would like to see solar technology here -- and that we have admired our friends from Namonde Village.
49,2022-10-01,108," **Interviewer**: Thanks, the message will be shared.",NA
50,2022-10-01,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: We heard that the Village Development Committee (VDC) chair went for training. After he came back from the training, he called us to select people who were interested to get the digester. Apart from that, we do not know exactly where these things came from."
50,2022-10-01,2," **Interviewer**: So you communicated more with the VDC chair, and he is the one who liaised with project implementers to identify the beneficiaries, right?", **Interviewee**: True.
50,2022-10-01,3," **Interviewer**: Okay, who funded it?", **Interviewee**: I believe it was funded by a non-governmental organization.
50,2022-10-01,4, **Interviewer**: What is the name of this organization?," **Interviewee**: We have just forgotten, but they gave us the name."
50,2022-10-01,5, **Interviewer**: Who built it?," **Interviewee**: The same people who came with the digester bag. It was them who placed the bag in the hole, assembled the pipes and other fittings. Then, they advised us to feed the digester with cow manure and water. Because, the task of preparing feedstock was hard, we hired some women to do the job. After we finished they went and came another time."
50,2022-10-01,6," **Interviewer**: So, I can see that the process involved the visitors, and you and your people some of which you hired did the job...."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was the one who dug the hole."
50,2022-10-01,7, **Interviewer**: Alone?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, alone. I was also responsible for buying bricks. At first, we did not do any masonry work on it because we expected to receive cement from the project implementers. Then, they came and told us that it was our duty to buy cement. So, we gathered sand and bricks onto one place, and when we saw that we could not manage to buy cement, we just used mud to line it the brick wall."
50,2022-10-01,8, **Interviewer**: Did you line the whole hole?," **Interviewee**: No, we just lined the top of the hole to prevent soil from collapsing into the hole. Then, after failing to buy bags of cement initially, we bought one bag of cement to plaster to the hole after a month or so."
50,2022-10-01,9, **Interviewer**: Who did the masonry work?, **Interviewee**: I did that alone.
50,2022-10-01,10, **Interviewer**: You have said you used the one bag of cement to line the top of the hole. How many bricks did you use?, **Interviewee**: I used 150 bricks to line the top of the digester hole and for the digestate hole.
50,2022-10-01,11, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the bricks?, **Interviewee**: I bought it from a certain man called \[name redacted\] somewhere there.
50,2022-10-01,12, **Interviewer**: How much did you spend on the bricks?," **Interviewee**: I bought each brick at K25, and I bought 250 bricks but I only used 150 bricks."
50,2022-10-01,13, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came to build it?, **Interviewee**: Two or three people came.
50,2022-10-01,14," **Interviewer**: On top of what you have mentioned, what other role did you play?"," **Interviewee**: I was only responsible for digging the hole, doing the masonry work, and paying the laborers' to source feedstock."
50,2022-10-01,15," **Interviewer**: In this community, we have many people and a lot of households. How were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: I was chosen while I was not around. I only got a message that I was summoned to Chief \[name redacted\] court. When I got there, they told me that they had selected me as a beneficiary of a biogas digester that was part of a pilot of biogas project. Then, they told me that they had chosen me because I am active in community development initiatives and they believed that I could manage it. Therefore, they asked me if I was interested and I told them that I would be interested to own a digester, so that is how I was selected."
50,2022-10-01,16, **Interviewer**: Is it true that you are active in community development initiatives?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and that is why they had no doubt that I could manage it."
50,2022-10-01,17, **Interviewer**: Tell me you activeness in community development initiatives?," **Interviewee**: There are a lot of community development projects that I have been involved in. For example, before the biogas intervention, I volunteered to take part in a tree-planting program that was intended to restore trees in this community. I was very much involved in that, so since the biogas project was also about saving trees, I believe that's why the chose me."
50,2022-10-01,18," **Interviewer**: When you were called to Chief \[name redacted\] Court, you had the freedom to say thanks but no. So, why did you accept to buildit here?"," **Interviewee**: I expected to use it for cooking as they promised. So, I thought I would stop going to the mountains to look for firewood. Thus, I accepted it because I expected it to offer me an opportunity to use my cow manure for cooking by simply collecting fresh cow manure and then mixing it with water."
50,2022-10-01,19," **Interviewer**: Between going around searching for firewood and preparing feedstock to get flame for cooking, which one is better for you?"," **Interviewee**: It was better to prepare feedstock to get fire because the feedstock was gathered within from my cow house. Also, biogas is better since it does not damage the environment."
50,2022-10-01,20, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I did not know anything about biogas."
50,2022-10-01,21," **Interviewer**: You have told me how you were introduced to biogas at the chiefscourt, could you please take me through your first encounter with the project implementers. What did they tell you?"," **Interviewee**: The first time when they came, they parked their car here because the road was accessible that time. So, that time they told us that we needed to work hard so that the digesters would work and help us. Then, after installation, they encouraged us that if the digesters worked, they would make some improvements. They said that as it continues working it starts producing more gas that we could use it for other purposes like charging phones, lighting, and as a source of power for TV. So, we were very excited about it. Then, I started visiting other beneficiaries to see how they were doing, and to see if I was doing things as I was told. Then, I found out that I was doing the same. And, even when my digester started misbehaving, I was going to them to see where I was doing wrong... The first problem we had was that gas started leaking at the gas connector. Then, we glued it up with an adhesive and it worked. After the digester had worked for some time, the gas pipes developed tiny cracks, so gas started leaking. As a result, we could not get flames at the stove."
50,2022-10-01,22," **Interviewer**: Okay, so they told you that you would be using the digester for cooking, and if it worked well and started producing enough gas, you would be using it as a power source for your appliances as well as for lighting. Apart from these, what else were you told to expect by the installers?", **Interviewee**: That was all I was told.
50,2022-10-01,23, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: Ah, we did not go for training."
50,2022-10-01,24," **Interviewer**: Then, how were you able to use it?"," **Interviewee**: We were just doing what they told us during installation. At first, they came with the digester bag, placed in the hole, and then assembled it. Then, we fed and closed it, and the digester bag got full after sometime. Then, they came again to assemble the green pipe, the two bottles and the stove. Then, they commissioned it, and it produced flame. So, when they were commissioning it, they showed us how to turn it on and off."
50,2022-10-01,25," **Interviewer**: You are saying you did not receive training, but you were just told one or two things, for example, how to switch it on. How prepared to run or operate the digester did you feel you were? And, did you feel that it was enough?"," **Interviewee**: A proper training was needed. A proper training would have given us confidence and knowledge to know where we could get the spare parts once replacement of parts was required. It could have also given us the knowledge and skills to diagnose problems, and then solve them. So, I believe we would have gotten these kinds of skills through training only."
50,2022-10-01,26," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?"," **Interviewee**: Before the Intervention, we used the trees we planted around as firewood for cooking. So, we simply cut a tree, chop it up, dry it, and then use it as firewood. Also around this time, our women go to the fields, gather dry pigeon peas plants, and use it as firewood for cooking."
50,2022-10-01,27," **Interviewer**: At that time, did you have any livestock?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, at that time, I had pigs and cows. I had a brick fenced animal housethen, but it collapsed after heavy rains."
50,2022-10-01,28, **Interviewer**: I can also see that you have chickens.," **Interviewee**: Yes, I have chickens, and even guinea fowls. And, even that time, I had them."
50,2022-10-01,29, **Interviewer**: Do you think you were chosen because you had livestock?, **Interviewee**: It could be.
50,2022-10-01,30, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your animal manure?," **Interviewee**: We gather pig and cow manure onto one place. After some time, we collect and use the manure as fertilizer for our crops. We also do the same with chicken and guinea fowl manure. We simply sweep the animal house and place the manure in a sack bags. Then, before planting crops, we apply the manure as fertilizer in our fields."
50,2022-10-01,31," **Interviewer**: Does it work? Or, do you add inorganic fertilizer?"," **Interviewee**: It works okay. But, of course, we add a little inorganic fertilizer as well."
50,2022-10-01,32, **Interviewer**: How many pigs and cows?, **Interviewee**: I had 5 cows and 7 pigs.
50,2022-10-01,33," **Interviewer**: That is a lot. Let us talk about how it worked, but before that let talk\'s about how it was installed and commissioned. At first, you were told dig a hole and you did, and then they brought the digester bag. Was the digester hole dug on the same day you were given the digester bag?"," **Interviewee**: I believe I dug the whole for 3 days. Then, they came with the digester bag, which had two openings. Then, they fitted a white pipe on each end of the digester bag opening, and then tied it with rubber strips. After that, we placed the digester bag in the hole. Then, they advised me to dig another hole at the outlet for collecting digestate. They said that the digester would be release digestate on its own at the outlet as I keep feeding it. Then, they left as I was digging the hole for the digestate."
50,2022-10-01,34," **Interviewer**: Okay, how much feedstock did first charge it with?", **Interviewee**: I started it up with 6 bags (50kg) of fresh cow manure.
50,2022-10-01,35, **Interviewer**: Where did you get it?," **Interviewee**: I got all the manure from my cow house. I remember they gave us 3 days to prepare and gather the manure. So, after grazing the whole day, we would goto the cow house every morning to collect manure because that is when you get a lot of manure. I believe we got 2 bags of fresh manure a day."
50,2022-10-01,36, **Interviewer**: So you got all the six bags from you cow house?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
50,2022-10-01,37, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?," **Interviewee**: We are lucky today that we have a borehole close by. But that time the borehole was very far from here. I think it was approximately 2.5 kilometers from here. So, to make sure that we did the job in time we hire women to draw water for us. I think we collected a drum (200 liters) of water, but when we started preparing the feedstock, we found out that the water was not enough. So, we hired extra workers to do the job and to show the installers that we were committed by meeting their request. We hired many women, and we feed the bag with a lot of water."
50,2022-10-01,38, **Interviewer**: How many people did you hire?," **Interviewee**: The first time, I paid the women K3000. The second time, I hired eight women and they used those 40 liters buckets to carry the water, and they were drawing water as we were preparing the feedstock. I agreed to pay the women K1, 000 each after the work. Because, it was very sunny and I wanted them to do the job as fast as possible, I paid them more than usual. So, in total, I paid the women K11000 for the water that was used."
50,2022-10-01,39, **Interviewer**: How much water was that?," **Interviewee**: The first time it was a drum (200 liters). The second time it was difficult to count because we just agreed that they should collect enough water to make suitable slurry, so they were simply adding water to the cow manure without counting. But, they collected more than two drums (200 liters) of water the second time. It was a lot of water."
50,2022-10-01,40, **Interviewer**: I can imagine. How long did it take to start up?," **Interviewee**: It took the installers a month to come and finalize the installation. But during that time, the bag got full. So, when they came and installed the remaining equipment, the digester worked."
50,2022-10-01,41, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: After commissioning, it produced strong fire, and it worked very well for 2 weeks... On the day of commissioning, they told us to feed it with a bag of fresh cow manure everyday. So, we used to feed it with a bag of cow manure, and my wife was the one who was responsible for collecting water."
50,2022-10-01,42, **Interviewer**: How much water were you adding to the cow manure?, **Interviewee**: 2 buckets of that bucket there.
50,2022-10-01,43, **Interviewer**: I think that is a 40 or 60-liter bucket.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, so we were mixing 2 buckets of water with a bag of cow manure, and then we were feed the digester in order to make it produce gas daily."
50,2022-10-01,44," **Interviewer**: You said during the first two weeks, it worked it quite okay. How much cooking time did you get in those 2 weeks?"," **Interviewee**: During the first two weeks, I was able to prepare breakfast in the minutes \[15 -- 30 minutes\] with it. I was also able to cook nsima and side dish on it \[1 -- 1 hour 30 minutes\]. In the evening, it was producing very little gas so my wife was not using it, because she thought it was taking very long. Thus, in the evening we were using firewood to cook things fast -- The fire was just too little in the evening."
50,2022-10-01,45, **Interviewer**: So in the first week you were able to prepare breakfast and lunch?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and I was even able to warm water for bathing too."
50,2022-10-01,46, **Interviewer**: How much cooking time did you get after 2 weeks?," **Interviewee**: After 2 weeks, we saw some changes. When we made feedstock and fed the digester, we saw that we were not getting enough gas. When I tried to analyze it, I saw that it was leaking gas at the gas connector."
50,2022-10-01,47," **Interviewer**: So after 2 weeks, gas started leaking at the gas connector. What did you do after?"," **Interviewee**: I reported the issue to the person who was coordinating the program here. Then, he sent a person who sealed the place with an adhesive. Even then, I noticed that it was not working as before."
50,2022-10-01,48, **Interviewer**: Who is the person who fixed it?," **Interviewee**: I do not know. But, it looked like some one from the community."
50,2022-10-01,49, **Interviewer**: How much cooking time did you get after that?," **Interviewee**: After that, we could not use it before 11 AM, even if we fed it early in the morning as we were told in the first place. So, we were only able to cook nsima \[25 -- 35 minutes\] and boil water for bathing \[15 -- 20 minutes\]"
50,2022-10-01,50," **Interviewer**: So after that, you could not prepare breakfast and supper, you would only use it around noon?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
50,2022-10-01,51, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to stop working?, **Interviewee**: We used it close to 5 months.
50,2022-10-01,52," **Interviewer**: So in 5 months, you were able to cook nsima and boil water \[30 -- 60 minutes\]?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was able to cook nsima or side dish and boil water \[30 -- 60 minutes\].... I remember I asked where the gas was coming from. So, I was told some organisms in the manure produce the gas."
50,2022-10-01,53," **Interviewer**: Okay, how long did it take for the person who fixed it to come after you reported to person who was coordinating the project here?"," **Interviewee**: It took more than a week. It was one week, I think."
50,2022-10-01,54, **Interviewer**: So after 5 months it completely stop?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
50,2022-10-01,55, **Interviewer**: How did it stop?," **Interviewee**: After feeding it, and the bag was getting full. And, when we wanted to use it, we were opening gas valves, and then we got gas at the stove. But, after 5 months, we stopped getting gas at the stove even after feeding it as usual."
50,2022-10-01,56, **Interviewer**: What happened?," **Interviewee**: When we analyzed the pipes, we saw multiple small cracks on the gas pipe. Then, we bought seal tape and sealed the cracks, but it did not work. After this, we realized that we made a mistake by putting the pipe in the ground instead of hanging it in the air. As a result, people were stepping on it instead of avoiding it. But, I blame myself for not removing the pipe on the ground though the installer put them there. I think we should have thought that ourselves. After that, because we did not go for training, we failed to know where we could have gotten the gas pipe, so we left it. Then, we asked the one who was coordinating the project here, where we could find the pipe and he told us that he would report the issue to the installers."
50,2022-10-01,57," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did you use the gas?", **Interviewee**: It was only for cooking.
50,2022-10-01,58, **Interviewer**: How many people used the gas that time?, **Interviewee**: We were 7 people.
50,2022-10-01,59, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: I was responsible for preparing the feedstock. My wife and girl child were simply supporting me in sourcing water though.
50,2022-10-01,60," **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock? Did you use a mixer, stick or something?", **Interviewee**: I was using my hands.
50,2022-10-01,61, **Interviewer**: Did you have any problems with that?, **Interviewee**: I had no problem with that.
50,2022-10-01,62, **Interviewer**: Didn't you feel gross about handling manure?, **Interviewee**: No
50,2022-10-01,63, **Interviewer**: How would do you describe the task of feeding it? Wasn't it tough?," **Interviewee**: It was not tough. Every morning, I was simply going to the cow house, collect fresh cow manure, mix it with water, and then feed the digester."
50,2022-10-01,64, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?, **Interviewee**: They just told us that we should report any problem and that they would be coming to rectify the problem.
50,2022-10-01,65, **Interviewer**: Who were you supposed to report to? Who was coordinating the project there?," **Interviewee**: I was told to report to the VDC chair, \[name redacted\], and it was him who was suppose to report to the ADC chair, \[name redacted\]."
50,2022-10-01,66," **Interviewer**: So the first time it leaked gas, you reported to the VDC chair, \[name redacted\] who then reported the issue to \[name redacted\]?", **Interviewee**: Exactly!
50,2022-10-01,67, **Interviewer**: The second time?," **Interviewee**: The second time when I noted the cracks I thought I would fix it on my own with seal tape. But, I failed because the cracks were just too many. That's when I reported the issue to \[name redacted\]."
50,2022-10-01,68," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: It was working, but the problem I thought was small turned into a bigger problem. So, the main problem I had with is that it didn't take long to start producing insufficient gas."
50,2022-10-01,69," **Interviewer**: When you had it, where you still using conventional methods of cooking?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, at first I was able to use it in the morning hours and during lunchtime. But, at evening hours, I was using firewood because my wife thought that the gas that was coming was very little. After sometime, I was only able to use it in the afternoon hours."
50,2022-10-01,70, **Interviewer**: Is it wrong to say that it did not meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: You are not wrong because I was not able to cook on it throughout the day, as it cooking systemis supposed to."
50,2022-10-01,71, **Interviewer**: Did you differentiate how it worked during cold weather and hot weather?," **Interviewee**: The experience I had with it is that in rainy season, it was working, but not as in dry season. In the rainy season, rainwater was getting into the digester hole, so we thought that was the reason it was not working as effective as in the dry season."
50,2022-10-01,72, **Interviewer**: How much cooking time did you get in the wet season?," **Interviewee**: There was not much difference. I remember this other day they came in January or December \[rainy season\] and they found me in the fields. They called me in, and I started the stove and it produced strong fire."
50,2022-10-01,73, **Interviewer**: So the difference wasn't a lot?, **Interviewee**: Yeah -- even in rainy season it was working.
50,2022-10-01,74, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: The one challenge I had with it is that sometimes I did not have enough cow manure, so I was failing to feed it as directed."
50,2022-10-01,75," **Interviewer**: But, I imagine that you had the same number of cow or if you had less, the difference was not much."," **Interviewee**: But, there are some times you go in a cow house and you find very little manure, perhaps due to poor feeding. So, it\`s not necessarily the number of cows, but feeding that determines the quantity of cow manure."
50,2022-10-01,76, **Interviewer**: What other challenges did you do face apart from feeding?, **Interviewee**: Maybe the problem I had with the gas connector and cracking of the gas pipe.
50,2022-10-01,77, **Interviewer**: Did you ever call the installers? I can see on this handover paper you were given 3 numbers of the installers.," **Interviewee**: The people who chose us advised that we should report to them, and then they would report to their superiors, who would then report to the installers."
50,2022-10-01,78, **Interviewer**: How many times did you report to the VDC chair?," **Interviewee**: Twice. The first time when it started leaking gas at the gas connector, and then when it stopped working."
50,2022-10-01,79, **Interviewer**: I do not if I have heard you correctly. I recall the first time when you reported they came to fix. What happened the second time?," **Interviewee**: I think the second time \[name redacted\] came and said he would report to \[name redacted\]. But, when he reported to the installers they were like they would come."
50,2022-10-01,80," **Interviewer**: Sure, have you seen something like this \[table of intervention\]?", **Interviewee**: No.
50,2022-10-01,81, **Interviewer**: What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?," **Interviewee**: Of course, it would have helped us, because we would have been following whatever guidance which ison this paper."
50,2022-10-01,82," **Interviewer**: How do you meet your energy needs now? You mentioned that you use trees around, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, when we want to cook these days we use the trees around. As you can see, some of trees are not big enough to be used for building purposes, so we cut them for firewood. Then, we also use dry pigeon peas plants and maize stalks."
50,2022-10-01,83, **Interviewer**: Do you still use manure as fertilizer for your crops?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we still do that."
50,2022-10-01,84, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. How much did the reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: I have just forgotten how much it was, but they told me."
50,2022-10-01,85," **Interviewer**: K200,000, K400,000 or K1,000,000?"," **Interviewee**: I can't really remember, but it was in hundreds I think."
50,2022-10-01,86, **Interviewer**: Who provided the money?," **Interviewee**: They mentioned that it was an NGO, but I have forgotten its name."
50,2022-10-01,87, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: No, it is only that I worked on it and paid the workers I hired. I can also think of the bricks and cow manure provided. But, the installers provided most of the things."
50,2022-10-01,88, **Interviewer**: You have said you did the digging alone?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
50,2022-10-01,89, **Interviewer**: You also did the masonry work alone?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
50,2022-10-01,90," **Interviewer**: Apart from these, what else did you do?"," **Interviewee**: Maybe sourcing cow manure, and then preparing feedstock. There was not any other work besides this."
50,2022-10-01,91, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: When the things came, we did not bother to ask them where the things came from."
50,2022-10-01,92, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion do you think it is from here?, **Interviewee**: It is not from here.
50,2022-10-01,93, **Interviewer**: Why did you say that?," **Interviewee**: The plastic of the digester bag looked thick and very durable. So, I would think it was from abroad. Then, I also think that some of the things were from here, for example, the gas pipe because it did not last long as I expected. Talking of the cost of the reactor, I would really appreciate, if you could tell me the cost of it."
50,2022-10-01,94," **Interviewer**: Now, some cost K600, 000, some even over a million, but it depends on the size. And, since I don't know the exact size of your digester I can't tell you its exactly cost. Did the digester help you save money?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, it did."
50,2022-10-01,95, **Interviewer**: Please explain to me.," **Interviewee**: It helped us save money because, generally, there are certain times we do not cut trees. So we buy firewood from our friends from Mozambique at all cost. I mean, we grow tobacco, so we sometimes use the trees economically and specifically for curing tobacco and construction of barns only."
50,2022-10-01,96, **Interviewer**: How often do you buy firewood?," **Interviewee**: We mostly use maize stalks and the firewood from within. So, sometimes especially in rainy season we buy, for example, firewood of K2000 and we use it for a month or two."
50,2022-10-01,97, **Interviewer**: We are remaining with 3 questions. What was the biggest change in your life the time you had biogas?," **Interviewee**: I was very happy to see it working, and if it had continued, I would have been very happy because I could have saved many things, for example, money and trees. Also, if it had continued our lives would have changed greatly because we do not have electricity here. So, if it had continued, we would have had power to use for lights and other electric appliances."
50,2022-10-01,98, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I can only say that if it had worked for long it would have helped me a lot. But, the problem is that it did not work long."
50,2022-10-01,99, **Interviewer**: So you think it is useful if it can work for a long time?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, if it works and continues."
50,2022-10-01,100, **Interviewer**: Why do you think it did not continue?, **Interviewee**: It did not continue because of the gas connector as well as the pipes -- Those parts were not durable.
50,2022-10-01,101, **Interviewer**: Do you think biogas has a future in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: I personally think that it has no future because supply of cow manure is not always constant. There are certain times when cow manure becomes scarce, and you wonder how is that possible even possible when the number of livestock is the same. So, I think many people would fail to manage it because of manure. So, it is not necessarily that you have the cows, but cow manure production depends on cow management, and cow management is not an easy thing."
50,2022-10-01,102," **Interviewer**: I see. If you could have designed your own energy or waste intervention, what would you have chosen instead? I can see you have solar panels now.", **Interviewee**: I think solar technology is a better option.
50,2022-10-01,103, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?, **Interviewee**: It is because it gets its energy for from something that is ever-present and not difficult to find as we saw with biogas.
50,2022-10-01,104, **Interviewer**: Where does it get its power?, **Interviewee**: It gets its power from the sun.
50,2022-10-01,105, **Interviewer**: That's was my last question. Do you have anything to say before we close?," **Interviewee**: My last word is a plea. We tried biogas and we worked hard to overcome its many obstacles. Now, I would like to ask for a different alternative like solar technology. People are using solar panels in communities and its working. Some people have been given solar panels and we see that they are benefiting. So, for us who managed biogas; for us who handled manure without gloves, but gotten anything, we should be considered. After all the hard work, nothing beneficial happened to us. So, in case of a new intervention, consideration of a new technology should be given to the people who worked for nothing on biogas project as a consolation. In short, the project implementers should consider us with a new technology. And, when they are bringing the technology, they should come directly to the people because there is a lot of politics. I think, they only gave us biogas because others would not have managed. If it was something easy an appealing, I'm sure I would not have got it."
50,2022-10-01,106, **Interviewer**: I understand you. Thanks a lot for the interview.,NA
51,2022-10-01,1," **Interviewer**: First question, where did the digester originate from?", **Interviewee**: \[Stays long without response\]
51,2022-10-01,2," **Interviewer**: I've told you that I have come from Blantyre, Poly. Where did the installers say they came from?"," **Interviewee**: Have I not forgotten? I have forgotten. But, before the installersleft the place, they gave me a paper with their names on it. I don't have the paper here though; it's at my other place."
51,2022-10-01,3," **Interviewer**: Okay, who funded it?", **Interviewee**: They said it was a non-government organization
51,2022-10-01,4, **Interviewer**: What's the name of the organization?, **Interviewee**: I have forgotten.
51,2022-10-01,5, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came?," **Interviewee**: They came 2 people. When they came, they asked us to dig a hole and gather feedstock."
51,2022-10-01,6, **Interviewer**: How many of you dug the hole and gathered feedstock?," **Interviewee**: It was 3 of us; my elder sister, brother and me."
51,2022-10-01,7, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to finish that work?, **Interviewee**: It took us three days to dig the hole.
51,2022-10-01,8, **Interviewer**: Do you remember how big the hole was?, **Interviewee**: It was 1 meter deep and the diameter was roughly 1 meter too.
51,2022-10-01,9, **Interviewer**: How much manure and water did they ask you to find?," **Interviewee**: They told us to find a lot of manure and water. So, when they came we mix cow manure and water to make suitable slurry."
51,2022-10-01,10, **Interviewer**: How many bags or buckets of cow manure did you find?, **Interviewee**: We found a lot of cow manure. I believe we managed to gather 8 bags (50kg) of cow manure.
51,2022-10-01,11," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's a lot. Where did you get the manure?"," **Interviewee**: There is a small grassy floodplain somewhere there where all the cows from this area usually graze. All the herdsmen usually go there and do there thing. So, we used to go there around 5:00 PM to collect cow manure. And, some we got from our cow house; we also got some from neighbors within."
51,2022-10-01,12, **Interviewer**: How many cows did you have that time?, **Interviewee**: I had 4 cows.
51,2022-10-01,13, **Interviewer**: How far is the grassy floodplain from here?, **Interviewee**: It's behind those white houses you are seeing there.
51,2022-10-01,14," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's like 1 kilometer from here. From the 8 bags you got, how many bags did you get from your cow house?"," **Interviewee**: Maybe, I got 1 or 2 bags. But, most of the manure we got from the grassy grazing place."
51,2022-10-01,15, **Interviewer**: How many were you were involved in this task?," **Interviewee**: It was 3 of us. And after we got the manure, we kept it the bags while waiting for the installers to come."
51,2022-10-01,16, **Interviewer**: How long did it take them to come?, **Interviewee**: It didn't take long. It didn't take more than a week. I think it was 3 days.
51,2022-10-01,17," **Interviewer**: How much water did you use, and where did you get the water?"," **Interviewee**: We used to want drum of water and some buckets. On top of that, we also used rainwater because it rained that day. And, most of the water we used was rainwater."
51,2022-10-01,18," **Interviewer**: Oh, you were very lucky -- you started with luck on your side. Where did you get other water?", **Interviewee**: We got it from the borehole.
51,2022-10-01,19, **Interviewer**: Is it far?," **Interviewee**: No, it's not far. It's there"
51,2022-10-01,20, **Interviewer**: That's like 300 meters. How were you selected as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: We just saw the people coming with our brother. Then, they explained to us that wanted to bring a digester. And, they advised us to find cow manure and to dig a hole for the digester bag. They also commented that it was easier for us to run the digester because we had cows. After they left, that's when we immediately started the work."
51,2022-10-01,21, **Interviewer**: How was the selection process like? Were the chiefs involved?," **Interviewee**: I don't know if the Chief's did the selection. But, I only know that the installers installed a couple of digesters in different villages in this area through the area development committee (ADC)."
51,2022-10-01,22," **Interviewer**: Oh, I get it. So, it's the ADC, which identified the beneficiaries since they have information regarding community members, so they must have known who was capable. You had the right to deny it. So why did you accept it here?"," **Interviewee**: I accepted it because they told me that with the digester I would be able to get digestate that works as fertilizer. They also said I would be able to get lighting as well energy for electric appliances. So, when I heard that I accepted it and I was happy to see how it was going to work out."
51,2022-10-01,23," **Interviewer**: So you accepted it because they told you that you would be able to use it for lighting, fertilizer, for your TV, and obviously to use it for cooking...", **Interviewee**: Definitely!
51,2022-10-01,24, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't!"
51,2022-10-01,25," **Interviewer**: Apart from what you have told me, what else did you expect from the digester?"," **Interviewee**: It is basically what I've discussed. I expected to use it for cooking, for lighting, and as a source of energy for charging my phone. But, some people asked me this kind of question too. Then, they asked me if the installers had taken me for training to learn thoroughly about it. So, I told them that we had never gone for training, and that they only thing that they taught us was how to make feedstock. As a beneficiary, I was never taken for training, and I never sat somewhere together with the other beneficiaries to learn about biogas. On the day they came to assemble and commission the digester, they only told me to feed it with 3 buckets of manure. But, when I tried to feed it myself, I didn't see it working because the fire was not taking long to go off. Sometimes, the fire was even going off whilst I was cooking (laughs)"
51,2022-10-01,26, **Interviewer**: What were you doing after that?," **Interviewee**: I thought I was not feeding the digester enough, so I decided to put even more cow manure (laughs)."
51,2022-10-01,27," **Interviewer**: You have said some people came to ask you questions, who are these people?", **Interviewee**: Some people came to do research on biogas.
51,2022-10-01,28, **Interviewer**: Where did they come from?, **Interviewee**: I don't remember.
51,2022-10-01,29, **Interviewer**: How many were they?," **Interviewee**: They were 3 people, and they came with \[name redacted\] the former ADC chair."
51,2022-10-01,30," **Interviewer**: You are saying you didn't receive any training. But, you were only told how to make feedstock and have to switch it on and off. Apart from this, what else were you told?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they told us how to switch it on and off. After that, they told us to put a load on top of the digester bag, if we saw that the fire was little. This was done to increase pressure in the bag and intensify the gas. However, nothing changed even if we did put a load on the digester bag. Then, I notice that the point of connection between the bag and the gas pipe \[gas connector\] separated, so gas was leaking. Then, I told my brother about the problem and he sealed the part with an adhesive. Still, things didn't improve, and it never worked as it worked on the first day."
51,2022-10-01,31, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to notice that there was some sort of problem at the gas connector?, **Interviewee**: I think it took two months for that part to separate.
51,2022-10-01,32, **Interviewer**: How prepared to run or operate the reactor did you were after what they told you?," **Interviewee**: I felt like we lacked skills to operate and maintain it because even when it malfunctioned we didn't know what to do. That is why when it started misbehaving; we started feeding it with more than 3 buckets against their instructions, because I felt like 3 buckets weren't enough. As per instruction, we had to feed it every time we saw that gas was running out of the bag, just as you do with cars. When you see that your car is out of gas, you put gas. In the same way, they told us that when there was no gas in the bag, we should be feeding it. But, when I fed it nothing was happening, and that's why I started feeding it more than what they told me."
51,2022-10-01,33," **Interviewer**: Okay, great. We will talk more about how it worked, the problems you faced and how you tried to solve the problems later. But, for the time being, how did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?", **Interviewee**: I was using firewood.
51,2022-10-01,34, **Interviewer**: Where did you get it?, **Interviewee**: We just gather firewood around.
51,2022-10-01,35, **Interviewer**: How much firewood do you collect?," **Interviewee**: We collect a lot of wood because we try to gather enough firewood to meet all our needs. But, right now, we are using maize stalks too because firewood is expensive."
51,2022-10-01,36," **Interviewer**: Oh, so you buy firewood?"," **Interviewee**: We buy, and some we collect ourselves."
51,2022-10-01,37, **Interviewer**: Where do you collect the firewood?," **Interviewee**: We go to the mountains, but we pay tips. So, we choose to go there instead of buying the firewood, which is sold around here because it's cheaper."
51,2022-10-01,38, **Interviewer**: Whom do you pay the tips to?, **Interviewee**: To the people who are responsible for looking after the mountains.
51,2022-10-01,39, **Interviewer**: How far is it from here?," **Interviewee**: Is it very far from here, and sometimes we even go to Mozambique to get firewood."
51,2022-10-01,40," **Interviewer**: If you leave around 6:00 in the morning, what time do you return?", **Interviewee**: We come around this time \[after 4 PM\]
51,2022-10-01,41," **Interviewer**: Oh, after leaving in the morning?"," **Interviewee**: Oh, yeah. And, we leave as early as 3 in the morning, and if we go around that time, we get home at the 1 or 2 PM."
51,2022-10-01,42," **Interviewer**: Why leaving the early? And, do you feel vulnerable?"," **Interviewee**: It's okay. Nothing has ever happened to us. And, we go early to come back early."
51,2022-10-01,43," **Interviewer**: You have said you pay little money, what's this little money?"," **Interviewee**: Some ask us to pay K500, some K300."
51,2022-10-01,44," **Interviewer**: You have said that sometimes you buy firewood, how much firewood do you buy in a month?"," **Interviewee**: Around this time of the year, we don't buy or search for firewood because we use dry pigeon peas plants and maize stalks and cobs. In general, we rarely buy firewood."
51,2022-10-01,45, **Interviewer**: You are saying you had cows; do you still have cows?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I have"
51,2022-10-01,46, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock before the digester?, **Interviewee**: I was getting the manure to the farm.
51,2022-10-01,47," **Interviewer**: Some say animal manure is not a good fertilizer, what's your take?"," **Interviewee**: The manure somehow works, but it depends how you use it."
51,2022-10-01,48, **Interviewer**: How do you use it?," **Interviewee**: During this dry season and before making ridges, we put the manure in the farms. And, close to rainy season, we make ridges thereby burying the manure in the soil, and then plant maize. I do this and I see that it helps."
51,2022-10-01,49, **Interviewer**: Let's talk about how it worked. How long did it take to start it up?," **Interviewee**: The installers came and placed the digester bag in the hole in December of 2016. Then, in January of 2017, they came to commissioning it. But, I have forgotten how many weeks exactly it was. I remember that after the bag was placed in the hole and fed, it started inflating to the point that it rose above ground. And, the more the sun shone, the more the bag was getting full. It was reaching a point that when pinched no dent could appear on the bag. And, that was the point when they came and assembled everything. Afterwards, they taught us how to switch it on and off, and showed us the gas valves that needed to be opened to use it."
51,2022-10-01,50, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commission? How did it work after lighting it with a matchstick?, **Interviewee**: They didn't even light it up with a matchstick. They only turned on the switch knob and flame started. It was only lit up by striking a matchstick when it failed to light up the flame on its own
51,2022-10-01,51, **Interviewer**: Oh?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was the flame was lighting up without striking a matchstick."
51,2022-10-01,52, **Interviewer**: You mean you are starting it up without striking a matchstick?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, most of the times the flame was lighting up without striking a matchstick"
51,2022-10-01,53," **Interviewer**: Oh, by just turning it on?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, once you turned it on it was producing a sparking sound and it was lighting up the flame on its own. Once the sparking sound was made, the fire was starting."
51,2022-10-01,54, **Interviewer**: How much cooking time did you get on the first day when it was commissioned by the installers?, **Interviewee**: It worked and I even cooked it beans \[more than 2 hours\].
51,2022-10-01,55, **Interviewer**: It got cooked?," **Interviewee**: It was cooked perfectly, and I was excited. And, I thought my cooking needs were solved. Many people who passed along the way were asking me about the digester. At first when the digester bag had not rose above the ground people thought the pipes were for water supply. But, when the people saw the bag full, many people became curious to know what it was and they were coming to ask me what it was. So, on the first day, things were good, and I even cooked beans - it was okay."
51,2022-10-01,56, **Interviewer**: What time was it?, **Interviewee**: It was in the afternoon.
51,2022-10-01,57, **Interviewer**: Did you cook nsima on it afterwards?," **Interviewee**: No, the fire was very little after cooking beans."
51,2022-10-01,58," **Interviewer**: Okay, how did it work on the second day?"," **Interviewee**: After cooking beans, the bag shrunk. Then, I made feedstock and fed it. On that day, I warmed water for bathing but the fire started declining, then I closed it. The following day, I fed it again in the morning hoping that I could use it in the afternoon to cook nsima. But, I took it out once I saw that the fire was not enough (laughs). Then, I proceeded to cook the nsima on firewood. After that day, I continued feeding the digester, but the bag was only getting full when there was the sun. And even when it was a sunny day, but once the sun disappeared, the bag was shrinking even without using it."
51,2022-10-01,59," **Interviewer**: You have said a digester is like a car, it needs refilling to keep on running or to use it. How often were you told to feed it and with how much feedstock?"," **Interviewee**: I was told to feed it daily with 3 buckets (20 liters) cow manure to which I was adding water to make suitable slurry. Afterwards, I was adding 40 liters of water separately."
51,2022-10-01,60, **Interviewer**: How much water were you adding to make suitable slurry of 20kgs of cow manure?," **Interviewee**: The manure was always fresh, so I was adding less water, probably less than 5 liters."
51,2022-10-01,61, **Interviewer**: You have described how it worked for the first three days. How did it work afterwards?," **Interviewee**: After the third day, I never used it for cooking. I tried to feed it, but every time the sun disappeared, the fire was also dying."
51,2022-10-01,62, **Interviewer**: Did you ever try to cook when the sun was on?," **Interviewee**: It's what I\'m saying, every time I put a pot on the stove, the fire was declining and eventually dying whilst the food I was trying to cook was not cooked."
51,2022-10-01,63, **Interviewer**: So we can say you only cooked on it once and that was on the first day?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it only worked one day."
51,2022-10-01,64, **Interviewer**: How many people lived here that time?," **Interviewee**: It was my brother, 3 children and me."
51,2022-10-01,65," **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements? First, you were supposed to feed the digester daily with cow manureand water. Apart from that, what were other operation requirements?"," **Interviewee**: They didn't say anything apart from that. They only added that if we failed to feed the digester, it would not produce gas. I remember he used a certain expression. He said that in the digester there are babies and the babies need feeding. If I don't feed the digester, the babies would die. And, when the babies die, I would get any flame. So, I was trying everyday to feed it to keep the babies alive (laughs)"
51,2022-10-01,66, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) you had hungry babies who couldn't get enough. Every day you had to feed them.," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) Yeah, and when the sun was out, the bag was producing a sound like something was boiling in the bag, and then it was releasing digestate at the outlet."
51,2022-10-01,67," **Interviewer**: Oh, it produced digestate. How did you make the outlet?"," **Interviewee**: We dug a hole, so that digestate would flow into it."
51,2022-10-01,68, **Interviewer**: Did you make a hole or something like a drain?," **Interviewee**: We made a hole, so that digestate would be collected in it. But, the hole had a drainage channel where excess digestate would overflow in."
51,2022-10-01,69, **Interviewer**: Did you use the digestate as fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: I heard that the digestate could be used as fertilizer, but I didn't know how to use it."
51,2022-10-01,70, **Interviewer**: They didn't tell you how to use it?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
51,2022-10-01,71," **Interviewer**: And, you didn't even ask?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, because they told us that they would be coming to monitor. So, we thought we would learn some of the things later."
51,2022-10-01,72, **Interviewer**: Did they come back?," **Interviewee**: They came but it was after I abandoned it. I abandoned after the inlet blocked, so it started returning feedstock at the inlet."
51,2022-10-01,73, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to block?," **Interviewee**: After two months or so. And, after it blocked, I abandoned"
51,2022-10-01,74, **Interviewer**: Who came? Is it the installers or the people who came to ask you questions?," **Interviewee**: It was not the installers. It was the people, who came to ask us questions."
51,2022-10-01,75, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?, **Interviewee**: I was responsible.
51,2022-10-01,76, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?, **Interviewee**: I was mixing the feedstock with hands.
51,2022-10-01,77, **Interviewer**: Like how? Didn\`t they give you gloves?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't"
51,2022-10-01,78," **Interviewer**: Then, how were you doing it?"," **Interviewee**: We used to put cow manure in a bucket, add water, stir and mix with hands to break the lumps. After the feedstock was thoroughly mixed, we poured it in the digester bag. We didn't use a stick because it was time consuming, yeah."
51,2022-10-01,79," **Interviewer**: Didn't you feel gross? I mean, it\'s not easy to handle cow manure with bare hands?"," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) we wanted the digesters, so we couldn't do other wise."
51,2022-10-01,80, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about feeding the digester on a daily basis?," **Interviewee**: If it was working properly, then it wouldn't have been a problem because I had a cow house within. Everyday morning, I was simply going to my cow house, collect manure and make feedstock. It wasn't tough as the first day where we had to go to search for cow manure elsewhere. And, that time too water wasn't a problem because it was in the rainy season."
51,2022-10-01,81, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that it is hard to work in the rainy season unlike in the summer?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't tell us that."
51,2022-10-01,82, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: When gas started leaking at the gas connector, I simply told my brother. I describe to him that when it was sunny and the bag was full, gas was leaking at the connector. I could see water bubbles and feel gas escaping. So, that's when he sealed the area with an adhesive."
51,2022-10-01,83, **Interviewer**: Did it work?," **Interviewee**: It didn't really work, and I only kept feeding it because I did not want to kill the babies, and I was expecting to be trained on it. Then, after some time, I just decided to abandon it since I wasn't using it anymore."
51,2022-10-01,84, **Interviewer**: Did they leave you their phone numbers to call when there was a problem?, **Interviewee**: I think their numbers were on the paper they left us.
51,2022-10-01,85," **Interviewer**: I think on the bag too, there was their numbers. Did you meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: It didn't reach my needs because I never used it in the morning in the afternoon and evening. And even when I tried to cook on it, I had to finish cooking somewhere on firewood."
51,2022-10-01,86," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were the challenges?"," **Interviewee**: The main challenge is that I was trying to feed it when it wasn't producing gas. So, I felt like I was working for nothing. I was working for nothing -- and you know when you are working you expect to get something out, but I never got anything out - and I was only hoping that they would come one day and train us on biogas to get skills, but we never got the skills."
51,2022-10-01,87," **Interviewer**: Again, how did you know that there was a leakage at the gas connector?"," **Interviewee**: When there was sunlight and the bag was full, water was coming out of the bag."
51,2022-10-01,88," **Interviewer**: And, this took two months for you to notice?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
51,2022-10-01,89," **Interviewer**: And, that's when you told your brother to fix it?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
51,2022-10-01,90, **Interviewer**: How many times did you feed it after it stopped working?, **Interviewee**: It was plenty of time
51,2022-10-01,91, **Interviewer**: Maybe 10 days or 2 weeks, **Interviewee**: It was more than that. It was 2 months or so
51,2022-10-01,92, **Interviewer**: You mean you kept feeding it for 2 months whilst it wasn't working," **Interviewee**: I felt that the bacteria in the reactor would die (laughs). So after I gave up and stopped feeding it, the bag kept on shrinking to the point it could not rose above ground, and eventually it shrunk completely."
51,2022-10-01,93, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this \[table of intervention\]?, **Interviewee**: No
51,2022-10-01,94, **Interviewer**: What do you think of this kind of information and do you think it would have helped in your case?,"It could have helped because we would have using it to know what was wrong with our digester. For example, that time I thought that, I wasn't feeding it with enough feedstock and I fed it more to improve it. So, if I had other information, I'm sure I would have tried that whatever information was on this paper and see how things were going to pan out."
51,2022-10-01,95, **Interviewer**: You are saying you started feeding it more than that you were told i.e. you started feeding it with more than three buckets of cow manure.How much exactly did you feed it with that time?," **Interviewee**: I started feeding it 5 or 4 buckets of cow manure, hoping that things would change (laughs)"
51,2022-10-01,96, **Interviewer**: (laughs) that's something else. How much water did you add to this?, **Interviewee**: 4 buckets (20 liters) of water.
51,2022-10-01,97, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of digester?, **Interviewee**: Hmm
51,2022-10-01,98," **Interviewer**: Let's suppose the installers call you today to ask youabout the digester, what would you say?"," **Interviewee**: I would tell them that the digester stopped working long ago. And that I tried to do everything you told me, but still nothing worked. And, if I have removed the bag, it's only last year."
51,2022-10-01,99," **Interviewer**: Why did you remove the bag? And, what did you do with it?"," **Interviewee**: What time the digester bag was close to the kitchen, and the kitchen collapsed. So, we just thought of taking it out. Also, our cows used to trample on the digester bag, so to avoid injuring the cows, my brother suggested that I should take it out."
51,2022-10-01,100, **Interviewer**: Is the bag damaged?," **Interviewee**: No, I did put the bag in a shelter after it I removed it from the hole. It's only this year that the roof of the shelter was taken out, and that why it's exposed anyhow today."
51,2022-10-01,101, **Interviewer**: How did you remove it without cutting it?," **Interviewee**: We hired people who dug around it and removed it. After it was removed, the people were stepping on the bag and manure was coming out of it pipes."
51,2022-10-01,102, **Interviewer**: So you didn't cut it.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we didn't cut it because we were sure that the people would come back and maybe work it out in a different way."
51,2022-10-01,103, **Interviewer**: How do you meet your energy needs now that it's not working?, **Interviewee**: We use anenergy efficient cook stove.
51,2022-10-01,104, **Interviewer**: Does it work?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it helps save firewood. I mean, with a 3-stone open stove, a lot of firewood is lost through the three openings. While, our energy efficient stove has only one opening, so flames are only concentrated onto the pot."
51,2022-10-01,105, **Interviewer**: Do you still have cows?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I have."
51,2022-10-01,106,How many do you have now?,We have four big ones and three small ones.
51,2022-10-01,107, **Interviewer**: How do you manage your feedstock now that it is not working?, **Interviewee**: We still use it in our farms as fertilizer.
51,2022-10-01,108, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. We have about five or six questions remaining. How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: They didn't say the amount. They just said the reactor is expensive.
51,2022-10-01,109, **Interviewer**: What about who provided the money for that?, **Interviewee**: I think they mentioned that it was a non-governmental organization.
51,2022-10-01,110, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: After we used our buckets to make feedstock to start it up, we devoted the buckets to biogas."
51,2022-10-01,111, **Interviewer**: Did you line it up i.e. was any masonry work involved?, **Interviewee**: No.
51,2022-10-01,112," **Interviewer**: Apart from digging the hole, sourcing manure and making feedstock, what other work was involved?", **Interviewee**: Nothing!
51,2022-10-01,113, **Interviewer**: What special items you had to be imported from another country?, **Interviewee**: Mm-hmm that I don't know. I wasn't told where it's from.
51,2022-10-01,114," **Interviewer**: When you look at it, where do you think it is from?"," **Interviewee**: It had many items, so I couldn't tell. For example, it had a bottle for trapping water in the system. It had another bottle for stopping bad smell. It had a stove, but the stove that was assembled here was different from the one that was installed at Mr. White... In this community, only 2 of got the digester. I heard people from other area too like Nambazo were installed digester the digesters. I didn't have a chance to see the one at Nambazo, but I heard that one didn't produce fire at all."
51,2022-10-01,115, **Interviewer**: Did the reactor save you money the time you had it?," **Interviewee**: No, it didn't work to the point I could have saved money."
51,2022-10-01,116, **Interviewer**: We are the remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I do believe that the digesters probably worked where they came from. As far as me, I expected to use it for cooking, to get fertilizer, and to use it for light. But, none of that happened here. So, my question is what happens when it doesn't work as in my case. (Laughs) Does it end here? If it ends here, why did they accept to lose so much money on digester that didn't help people? I mean, as far as I know, no digester worked around this part. There is no one who can stand here and say he or she benefited from this -- not even one!"
51,2022-10-01,117, **Interviewer**: Why do you think of the installers or project implementers never came back after spending a lot of money on these things like you have rightly said?," **Interviewee**: On that, I don't know. I don't know how they organized their project. I just don't know why they didn't follow up. But, I can't say we failed, because it's not possible for all of us to fail. So, I have many questions in my head on that too. I do think to myself where did I get it wrong, but I think it not me because other people too failed. I have even asked them if they went for training but they didn't too, Just like me. They were only told how to prepare feedstock and how to turn it on. That was all."
51,2022-10-01,118," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: Here when you talk of cooking you think of firewood and charcoal. So, I think energy efficient wood stoves are good alternatives as they save firewood."
51,2022-10-01,119, **Interviewer**: I see similarities in the energy efficient stove projects and biogas project. The one major difference is that biogas didn't work while the energy stoves worked. How do you differentiate between terms of execution of the project itself?," **Interviewee**: The two projects were different indeed in regards to impact. With biogas, despite that they gave us for free, we didn't see an impact -- the impact was zero. On efficient stove, the project implementers were organized and they even managed to attract us to buy the stoves. Now, we are using the stoves and it looks like we will use the stoves for along time, and the impact is great and positive too. Now, we use less firewood as compared to the time we were using 3-stone wood stove. Of course, it's still not easy to find firewood, but we save a lot of firewood on efficient stoves."
51,2022-10-01,120," **Interviewer**: To go out and search for firewood and to go to prepare the feedstock, which is easier for you?"," **Interviewee**: It's better to make feedstock because the cow house is within and you don't buy or pay any money to get the manure. With firewood, you need money to access it at least."
51,2022-10-01,121," **Interviewer**: Lastone, you have said the digesters were given to a number of people, but no one was able to use it. Why do you think of you failed?"," **Interviewee**: Mm-hmm, personally, I feel like I was lacking somewhere."
51,2022-10-01,122, **Interviewer**: What do you mean?," **Interviewee**: I feel like I didn't have the skills to operate and run it. I honestly feel the digesters were tried somewhere and worked. So, the project implementers should have given as the necessary skills and information attained in those areas. I feel like if we were given the necessary skills, we would have reached a point of using it for lighting as well as a source of fertilizer too. So, we failed because we were not given the necessary skills to run it."
51,2022-10-01,123," **Interviewer**: In closing, what are your last words?"," **Interviewee**: My last word goes to the project implementers. I would like to tell them that when they start a project, they should be able to finish it. Everything should be done right there and then. I feel like it was not rightto give us the digesters without training. They should have told us how to use the digestate too. And, if they had told me how to make and use the digestate, I'm sure I could have continued with it even though it wasn't producing fire for cooking. With the way the price of fertilizer has gone up, you can't do otherwise (laughs)"
51,2022-10-01,124," **Interviewer**: Thanks, aunt for the interview, I have to hit the road, it's getting dark.", **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming. Have a safe journey.
52,2022-10-01,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: They did mention something like they came from Blantyre. I did not really ask them where they came from. I was just excited when they came to tell us that they were going to install the digester here for cooking. Here charcoal is expensive and does not take long to last when you use it. So, we were spending a lot of money on charcoal instead of spending the money on buying necessities for the kids. Thus, when they came we were so happy, and"
52,2022-10-01,2, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: That I didn\'t ask. So, I don't know whether the money came from the government or from an NGO."
52,2022-10-01,3, **Interviewer**: When was it built?," **Interviewee**: I think it was built in 2018, 2019, or 2017. I think it was around those years. It's hard for us to remember when exactly it was, because we didn't gain anything from the digester. You know it\`s easy to remember something that you feel is important or helpful because you keep in your heart. So, I don't remember when it was built, because I don't feel in my heart that I was assisted. And, it hurts me a lot that it came. I remember this other day around this season, I went to the farm and I was expecting to use the digester upon returning. But, when I tried to switch it on it didn't work. Then, I asked my children to look for charcoal and they didn't find charcoal. So, I remember the day I slept hungry because of the digester."
52,2022-10-01,4, **Interviewer**: Who built it?," **Interviewee**: The installers advised us to source cement and bricks, so that they could line the hole. Thus, when we bought the things and they came with the digester bag and pipes. They also asked us to find manure and 3 drums (200 liters) of water. After we got that, we prepared the feedstock and fed the digester."
52,2022-10-01,5," **Interviewer**: How many bricks did you source? Or, how much did it cost you to source the bricks?"," **Interviewee**: That time a brick wasn't expensive as it is now. I think my husband spent K50000 to source bricks and cement. I remember we didn\'t feel that was too much because when we compared the amount of charcoal we use in a year for cooking with K50000 for biogas, we thought it was very fair. Plus, they told us that we could use it for a very long time, so we thought that it was very helpful and that we would save a lot of money in the long term. I remember we bought the bricks and we even paid the person who carried it here. But, we didn't really care about that because we knew we would use it for 5 years - They told us that it had a 5 year guarantee."
52,2022-10-01,6," **Interviewer**: Oh, its guarantee was 5 years?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they told us that."
52,2022-10-01,7, **Interviewer**: How many bags of cement did you use?, **Interviewee**: We used 4 bags of cement.
52,2022-10-01,8," **Interviewer**: Oh, it was a big one, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was 3 meters deep and 1.5 meters wide. And, they told us to lined up the sides and the wall was supposed to go above ground."
52,2022-10-01,9," **Interviewer**: Oh yeah, it was a lot of bricks and cement. What was your role?"," **Interviewee**: Basically, we sourced and prepared the feedstock. We also bought cement and bricks."
52,2022-10-01,10, **Interviewer**: Who dug the hole?, **Interviewee**: We hired people.
52,2022-10-01,11," **Interviewer**: How many were they? And, how much did you pay them?"," **Interviewee**: They were 4 people. I don't know how much they were paid because my husband was responsible for that. But, I know it was a lot of money because the hole was deep and they even reached the point where they found underground water."
52,2022-10-01,12, **Interviewer**: You have talked about cow manure. How much did you find?," **Interviewee**: They told us to find 3 bags of fresh cow manure. And, we didn't get all the manure in our cow house. Some of it we had to buy. We didn't manage to get the manure from our cow house because they specifically advised us to find fresh cow manure. It was strange for us that day to see us handling cow manure that we normally feel disgusted to handle. But, we handled it that day because we wanted to use the gas for cooking. So, every day we were always at it, making feedstock without wearing gloves. After that, we were washing hands with soap, and start off the day."
52,2022-10-01,13, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: We got it from the borehole.
52,2022-10-01,14, **Interviewer**: Is it close?, **Interviewee**: It's close to the \[location redacted\].
52,2022-10-01,15, **Interviewer**: That's like 500 meters. Where did you get the manure?, **Interviewee**: We got it from the grassy flood plain there. It's where herdsmen usually rest to feed cows in this community.
52,2022-10-01,16, **Interviewer**: How far is it from here?, **Interviewee**: It's far.
52,2022-10-01,17," **Interviewer**: It's far, right. I think I know the place. It might be 2 or 3 kilometers from here.", **Interviewee**: \[no response\]
52,2022-10-01,18, **Interviewer**: How many bags did you buy?," **Interviewee**: 3 bags. We couldn't get it from all of it from our cow house. People were even asking what we wanted to do with all the manure. It was awkward. But, we wanted it big time, so that's why we did put it a lot of effort. And, we felt lucky that time because many people were identified, but only a few of us were picked."
52,2022-10-01,19," **Interviewer**: For sure. In this community, we have many households, how were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: I think they chose us because we showed commitment. I remember a lot of people were asked you to find cement and bricks before the installers came. But, only a few people managed to source such materials because they simplified it too much and thought it wasn't important. So, people from different villages were chosen, but that happened after people refused to buy bricks and cement. We managed to get all the requirements because we saw its relevance, so when the installers came they gave us the digesters. I remember some people were told to dig a hole and source manure, but when the installers came, they didn't find the hole or manure, so they were omitted from the list of beneficiaries."
52,2022-10-01,20, **Interviewer**: So that's how you were selected. I would also like to know how people were identified including those who denied it or failed to get the requirements?," **Interviewee**: I don't know how people were identify. But, that time they installers were coordinating with the chairperson of ADC (area development committee). And, I remember it was the ADC chairperson, who was busy going to the potential beneficiaries to see if they had managed to dug the hole or source the manure. So the people who did not manage to get the requirements were omitted. But, I can say a lot of people were approached, but they denied it because they didn't want to handle cow manure."
52,2022-10-01,21," **Interviewer**: We have seen that many people were approached but deny it. Apart from what you have already said, why did you accept it to be built here?"," **Interviewee**: That time when we bought firewood at K500, we only used it in the afternoon and sometimes in the evening. Then, we multiply K500 by 30 days, and then by 12 months, and we found that it was a lot of money. Then, we thought about buying cement, bricks and digging a hole, and then use the digester for 5 years. So, we saw that it was far much cheaper to use a digester than firewood. We thought that the digester was a good thing and that people had denied it out of ignorance. Also, we thought we would be like people from Mozambique who don't spend money on energy for cooking. And, if you consider a household, a lot of money is spent on a daily on food and energy for cooking. So, that's why we sold our goats to source funds for the digester."
52,2022-10-01,22, **Interviewer**: You have told me that you thought you were going to be like people from Mozambique. What happens in Mozambique?," **Interviewee**: The people in Mozambique don't spend money like we do here in Malawi. If people spend money in Mozambique, then it's probably on buying salt. The people in Mozambique if they want side dish they go to the fields and get sweet potato leaves, cassava leaves, okra. People in Mozambique don't spend money on food items especially side dish."
52,2022-10-01,23, **Interviewer**: (laughs) seriously?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and it's only people who raise chickens around the house who eat good meals like side dish of chicken there. The people in Mozambique only eat vegetables from the fields for the rest of their lives. The people in Mozambique don't buy pigeon peas. They don't buy that. They get pigeon peas from their fields. And, the people their live far apart, it's not densed as it is here, so firewood is not a problem too. The people there don't spend money on vegetables or firewood, it's abundant there. \[Leave to attend to customers\]"
52,2022-10-01,24, **Interviewer**: Where were we? I think I asked you how you were chosen?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they chose me because of my commitment. I mean, when the installers went to the houses of some of the potential beneficiaries they didn't find the holes dug, so they through that they were serious."
52,2022-10-01,25, **Interviewer**: How did you know that some people were identified but didn't show seriousness and interest?," **Interviewee**: The installers asked us how we were able to buy cement and the bricks when most people didn't. Then, we told them that we had found that firewood expensive as compared to biogas, and that's why were committed."
52,2022-10-01,26, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: I didn't know anything about biogas. I have only heard that some people use LPG gas for cooking. But, I have never seen that too."
52,2022-10-01,27, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: We expected the digester to be beneficial and to change our daily lives. Little did we know that we would end up losing money. And, the money we lost was enough for us to use for 3 months to buy basic necessities, and it was not budgeted for that. We only spent the money because we expected to use it for 5 years. So, at the end, the whole thing saddened us."
52,2022-10-01,28," **Interviewer**: When you say, you expected it to be beneficial, I'm thinking about you expecting to use it for cooking. Apart from this, was there anything else you expected to benefit from it?", **Interviewee**: Nothing else. I only expected to use it for cooking.
52,2022-10-01,29, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that you could use it for lighting?, **Interviewee**: No.
52,2022-10-01,30, **Interviewer**: As a source of fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but they dwelled much on the cooking part?"
52,2022-10-01,31, **Interviewer**: What else were you told to expect from the installers? What else did they say?," **Interviewee**: When they came, they asked about us about the environment, for example, they asked us how the mountain was like back in the days. And, we told them that the mountain was full of trees and every time we glanced at the mountain, we saw trees. Now, we can't find trees in the mountains because people have used all the trees for cooking. Nowadays, the population is high, so it's hard for everyone to go to the mountains and find firewood for cooking. Then, they asked us how much firewood and charcoal we use. Afterwards, they told us about biogas, and we were asked if we were interested and could manage it. Then, we told them we would do what it takes to manage it because we were losing a lot of money on firewood, and our families were not developing because we spent a lot of money on firewood. Then, that's when they came back after some time to advise us to dig a hole, find cement, bricks and cow manure. Then, they came with the digester bag and pipes. When they came, they found that we had already dug the hole and sourced manure."
52,2022-10-01,32, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?, **Interviewee**: We didn't receive any training.
52,2022-10-01,33," **Interviewer**: Then, how were you able to use it?"," **Interviewee**: What kind of training we received was basic and not even worth to be called training. They just called us to the stove and demonstrated to us how to switch it on. Then, they asked us to switch it on to see if we could do it on our own. Then, they demonstrated how we could regulate the intensity of the stove by controlling the control knob."
52,2022-10-01,34, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you how to make feedstock?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and that is why I was going to the cow house everyday to make feedstock. I was getting a bucket and then place the manure in the bucket. Then, I was filling water in the bucket to make suitable slurry. As you know, you always find the grass in the cow manure, so they advised us to take out the trash to prevent blockages. Then, they advised us to make a sieve to help us sieve out the bad stuff."
52,2022-10-01,35," **Interviewer**: After you were told how to switch it on, how to control the intensity of the fire, and how to make feedstock, how prepared to run or operate the digester did you feel you were?", **Interviewee**: We felt everything was okay.
52,2022-10-01,36, **Interviewer**: You didn't feel that something was missing?," **Interviewee**: No, no!"
52,2022-10-01,37, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: We use firewood.
52,2022-10-01,38, **Interviewer**: Where did you get firewood?," **Interviewee**: People go to the mountains to fetch firewood and sell us at K500 per bundle. When we didn't have money, we were just cutting a tree from the compound, then chop and dry it to use it as firewood. Sometimes, when we wanted to warm water fast for the school-going children, we were going to the field and pick sorghum or pigeon dry plants."
52,2022-10-01,39, **Interviewer**: So you were spending something like K500 of wood every day?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and that was 2017. Now, when we buy firewood of K2000, we only use it for 2 days. And, the wood doesn't come from Malawi. It comes from Mozambique. The wood in our mountain is depleted, and now forest officials are very strict on cutting of trees. The forest officials have made it perfectly clear that there is no wood in the mountains, so when they find you in the mountains, they shoot your leg, and if you resist arrest or try to run, they shoot to kill. So, firewood is very scarce and you can't go into someone's field to gather dry sorghum or pigeon peas plants -- every goes to their fields to get such thing. Thus, if we want to cook, we use the wood from Mozambique and it's very expensive. They sell 3 small pieces of wood at K2000. And, charcoal is expensive too, they charge K4500 for the small bag (20kg) and that doesn't take long too. So, wood is very expensive and hard to find too here, and it\`s a struggle to cook firewood and charcoal."
52,2022-10-01,40, **Interviewer**: You told me you had cows that time. Do you still have them?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we still have."
52,2022-10-01,41," **Interviewer**: How did you manage cow manure before the intervention? You just use them as fertilizer, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
52,2022-10-01,42, **Interviewer**: Does it work?," **Interviewee**: It works quite okay. What we do is, after harvesting somewhere in July, we put the manure between the ridges. So, when it's time to prepare new ridges, soil from the old ridges is tilled and moved to where the manure is placed and buries it. Thus, when we plant maize it grows well. I harvest 15 or 20 bags (50kgs) of maize."
52,2022-10-01,43, **Interviewer**: How big is your farm?, **Interviewee**: It uses two bags of inorganic fertilizer.
52,2022-10-01,44, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up after feeding it the first time?," **Interviewee**: It didn't take long. I think it took two weeks. After feeding it, they closed the inlet and outlet pipe with a plastic bag, then the next day the bag started rising, and after a week or so we started hearing a hissing sound at the stove. Then, they came to start it up the digester. After that, they went to other beneficiaries too to start up their digesters."
52,2022-10-01,45," **Interviewer**: Okay, you have said you used 3 bags of cow manure to start it off, how much water did you use?", **Interviewee**: We used 3 drums (200 liters) of water.
52,2022-10-01,46, **Interviewer**: How did you work after commission?," **Interviewee**: On the first day, it worked okay and people came to see it. They were even calling one another to see it too. People couldn't believe that cow dung could be used to produce fire. And, the fire that was coming out was very powerful that I had to reduce the intensity to prevent the food from getting burnt."
52,2022-10-01,47," **Interviewer**: Approximately, how many people came?", **Interviewee**: 15 to 20 people came.
52,2022-10-01,48, **Interviewer**: What was their reaction?, **Interviewee**: They were surprised. They were saying that in no way would cow manure produce fire for cooking. They were so surprised. The people couldn't understand how cow manure produced fire.
52,2022-10-01,49, **Interviewer**: How many people were used the gas?, **Interviewee**: We were 8 people.
52,2022-10-01,50," **Interviewer**: Let's discuss how it worked on the first day and beyond. On the first day, how much cooking time did you get? Or, what things did you cook?"," **Interviewee**: I was able to cook nsima (30 -- 45 minutes) and side dish of dry fish ( 20 -- 30 minutes). The next day, I prepared feedstock and fed the digester as we were told to feed it every day. Then, I went to the farm, hoping to use it after returning. But, when I returned around 11 in the morning the digester couldn't produce fire. So, I went to the digester bag, and I found the bag still full. I was very puzzled because I didn't know what was wrong, and how to fix the problem too. The problem is that the installers didn't tell me what to do when gas was not coming to the stove. As a result, I abandoned the digester."
52,2022-10-01,51," **Interviewer**: Oh, sad. How much feedstock were you supposed to feed it?"," **Interviewee**: They told us to feed it with 5 kg of cow manure daily. So, what I was doing is, I was putting the cow manure in a bucket and then mix it thoroughly with 3 or 5 liters water. Sometimes, I was put something like a fishnet on the inlet pipe as I was pouring the feedstock to sieve out lumps and trash."
52,2022-10-01,52, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about handling cow manure?," **Interviewee**: It felt unpleasant and disgusting, as they didn't give me gloves to use. And, even the installers didn't use gloves to prepare the feedstock too. We couldn't do otherwise because we still had to cook. And, we didn't have the money to buy firewood as well, so we had to do what we had to do."
52,2022-10-01,53," **Interviewer**: Yeah, and you couldn't have asked for that as well since they were using bare hands too."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, you see."
52,2022-10-01,54," **Interviewer**: So, were you soaking or pre-treating the feedstock?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, no."
52,2022-10-01,55, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: Basically, I was responsible for feeding it. My boys too kept feeding it even after it stopped working on the second day, because we were optimistic that it would pick up and continue working. And, it even reached a point where when we fed it, manure was overflowing at the outlet because there was a lot of manure in it, and that's when we stopped."
52,2022-10-01,56, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about feeding it?," **Interviewee**: I was confusing because even though we were feeding it, we weren\`t getting gas. We only kept feeding it because they gave us a guarantee of 5 years, and since we didn't know what the problem was, we just had to keep feeding it ... it was a confounding."
52,2022-10-01,57, **Interviewer**: How many times did you feed it after they stopped working?," **Interviewee**: We fed it almost to 15 straight days after it stopped working. We didn't miss a day because we were advised you to feed it every day. Then, when we went to one of the beneficiaries, we gathered that their digester was not working as well, but they were still feeding it on a daily basis too. The surprising thing was that the digester bag was getting full, it was also making some sound and releasing slurry at the outlet, but it just wasn't producing gas. And, this was contrary to what they told us. The installers told us that once we get that sound in the bag, then it was automatic that it would produce fire at the stove."
52,2022-10-01,58, **Interviewer**: How did you make the outlet?," **Interviewee**: We dug a pit just like a refuse pit. But close to that was something like a gully that turns into a river during the rainy season. So, we made a channel to release digestate into the gully. And, when it rained, the digestate was carried away by rainwater via the gully."
52,2022-10-01,59," **Interviewer**: Were you told that you could use the digestate as fertilizer, right?"," **Interviewee**: They told us, but we didn't commit to it because we were told that the digester would produce fire, so when we saw that it wasn't happening we had no energy to follow all that -- we thought it was a lie, just like they lied about using it for cooking."
52,2022-10-01,60, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?, **Interviewee**: They did not tell us about that
52,2022-10-01,61, **Interviewer**: Did they give you their numbers?," **Interviewee**: No. If they left their cell numbers, then they must have left it with the ADC chair who was coordinating with them here -- and that's a maybe too. And, even if they had left their numbers, I don't think I would have called them because I lost faith in them."
52,2022-10-01,62, **Interviewer**: Can you elaborate on that?," **Interviewee**: I lost faith in them because I felt like they lied to me and made me lost money for nothing. And, that's why I didn't try to use the digestate because I didn't believe their word regarding the same. Frankly speaking, what had happened made me believe that the digestate couldn't work as well. So, even if I had their numbers, I don't think I would still have their numbers now because I have lost phones a lot. Plus, my SIM card I was using that time was blocked because I did register it during the national SIM card registration campaign."
52,2022-10-01,63," **Interviewer**: Okay, did it meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: It didn't meet my needs as you can clearly see, I wasn't able to cook nsima and anything else on it."
52,2022-10-01,64, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: I found the handling of fresh manure disgusting to the extent that it was affecting my appetite to eat food. I don\'t even have to tell you how unpleasant it is to handle cow manure. Imagine, how unpleasant you feel when you accidentally step on cow dung in the streets, so how bad do you think it might be to handle it with hands on a regular basis. So, I was only doing that because I was the one responsible for cooking. If I didn't do that, then my husband wouldn't have eaten -- so I just accepted it."
52,2022-10-01,65, **Interviewer**: How did the fire go off on the first day?," **Interviewee**: It worked well, and some people started talking bad against me. People were saying I'm pompous. Some people questioned how the installers installed a digester at my place and refused some of other places. Some chiefs were even angry that I was installed a digester instead of them -- people did talk a lot but I did not mind. I even felt bad that people talked against me on something that didn't work or help me in any way."
52,2022-10-01,66, **Interviewer**: People were talking out of jealousy?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. People couldn't understand why an ordinary person like me would get the digester. But, they forgot that the problem was theirs for failing to do what the installers asked them to do."
52,2022-10-01,67, **Interviewer**: Did you get little fire or no fire at all on the second day?," **Interviewee**: On the second day, it didn't produce fire. It was only producing a hissing sound."
52,2022-10-01,68, **Interviewer**: Did you try to light it up with a matchstick?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and we got the matchstick with confidence that we were going to cook. And, I almost finished all the matchsticks in the box because I thought I wasn't doing it right. I was like yesterday they asked me to do this and I did this the same thing and it worked, then why is it not working today? So, I tried to light it up with matchstick, but it didn't work, and then I gave up."
52,2022-10-01,69," **Interviewer**: So, you only saw fire on the first day, and afterwards you didn't see fire again?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
52,2022-10-01,70, **Interviewer**: Did you try to tell \[name redacted\] about this?," **Interviewee**: I reported to him and he asked me how I was trying to light it up. Then, I explained to him and he was like he was also doing the same, and that my digester was supposed to work. I think I reached out to him on the third day, and he was like his digester was producing flames. But, I'm not quite sure if it worked for long or not. I believe, when I told him, he communicated with the installers and he told them, because they were communicating. So, I just believe they just didn't want to come."
52,2022-10-01,71, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this \[table of intervention\]?, **Interviewee**: No!
52,2022-10-01,72, **Interviewer**: What do you think of the information and do you think it would have helped you?," **Interviewee**: It would have definitely helped because we could have tried to do what the information is saying. When there was a problem, we would have been going to this information to troubleshoot and solve problem. It's sad that the installers didn\'t give us this kind of information. They only told us about the inlet (feeding) and outlet (digestate). They didn\'t tell us anything regarding technicalities of the digester bag. As such, we didn\'t know anything about its operation and maintenance."
52,2022-10-01,73," **Interviewer**: Okay, if the installers could call you today to ask you about the state of your digester, how would you describe it?"," **Interviewee**: I would tell them that the digester only worked on the first day as you saw it. The next day you told me to feed it and I fed it as you told me, and I went to the farm. When I returned and switched on the stove, it was only producing a hissing sound whilst the bag was full. I didn't give up though; I kept on feeding as you advised me. Then, after some days, it started flashing out the feedstock at the outlet, so I stopped feeding it. From that time on, the bag started of shrinking up to the point it completely collapsed."
52,2022-10-01,74, **Interviewer**: From there what happened?," **Interviewee**: Then, a building that was close to the digester hole collapsed and fell into the hole. Then, the bag stay in the hole for close to a year, and that's when it was removed."
52,2022-10-01,75, **Interviewer**: How did you remove it people? People say it's difficult to do that.," **Interviewee**: Oh, it was hard work because all the manure we had fed it with dried up in the bag, so it wasn't easy to carry. As a result, I hired 4 people to take it out, and then I decided to use it as a roof sheet for this shelter we are sitting on."
52,2022-10-01,76," **Interviewer**: Oh, yeah. And I've seen you are using the green pipe as clothesline.", **Interviewee**: (laughs) yeah
52,2022-10-01,77," **Interviewer**: We have talked for some time now and you have said a lot of things. When you look back, in your opinion, what caused it to reach this stage?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know; is it that the digester itself doesn't have capacity to produce strong fire; or is it that the installers were trainees and missed something important on its technicality. But then again, I'm also inclined to think that when they brought the digesters here, they must have tried them somewhere regarding their capacity to produce fire for cooking and to help people. Then, why didn't they work here and help us here? So, I think the digesters were installed by trainees. And, I think if experts installed them, I believe they would have worked. I remember the person who installed it, he was this short person, and I must say he worked very hard. But, I think he didn't do something right."
52,2022-10-01,78, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. How do you meet your energy needs now that the digester is not working?," **Interviewee**: We still use the tradition methods of cooking. We use firewood, maize stalks. Around this time, we prune bluegum trees and use the branches as firewood. The bluegum trees here are private, and most have planted them in their homes due to firewood problems, and generally because mountains are very much protected now. So, firewood is budgeted for these days, everybody is following up on their trees too -- and people do not waste firewood these days, after cooking they extinguish the fire and take off the firewood to use later."
52,2022-10-01,79," **Interviewer**: I'm seeing a lot of bluegum trees in this community, what happened?"," **Interviewee**: The bluegum tree you are seeing that side, belongs to the agriculture office and ADMARC. The houses you are seeing their plant trees too during the maize planting season to replenish trees. So, you can see that a lot of people are or have planted trees because everyone has seen that sourcing firewood is a challenge these days."
52,2022-10-01,80, **Interviewer**: How do you manage your cow manure now? Do you still use it in the farm?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we still do that. Now, I have 15 bags that I'll use in the next coming days."
52,2022-10-01,81," **Interviewer**: Oh nice, how much did the reactor cost?"," **Interviewee**: Mm-hmm, they didn't tell us. Mm-hmm, we weren't told at all. And, the way I saw things they didn't have money too because if they had money they would have bought cement, brick sand even hired the people to dug the hole for us. So, we didn't ask them because we saw that they were short of money too, and the beneficiary did most of the things."
52,2022-10-01,82, **Interviewer**: Don't you think they asked you to buy some of the things to see and get your commitment?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's was pretty much that - they wanted to bring an element of ownership. They did that on purpose so that we could accept and commit to it considering that our money was spent on it thereby enhancing its sustainability. For example, the level of management differs on a piece of cloth you bought yourself and that which you are just given. For a piece of cloth, that one spent money on utmost care is taken. But, for a piece of cloth that was just given you just let, kids play with it. So, they knew that for us to take utmost care of the digesters, we had to buy the cement and handle the manure.... And, I must say we really handled cow manure, eeh! (Laughs)"
52,2022-10-01,83, **Interviewer**: It's not that they provided everything on the digester. Some of the things you did provide. What kind of things did you contributing in kind?," **Interviewee**: I'll just say what I contributed. I bought bricks and I paid people to transport them. I paid people money to dig the hole. That time I paid the people, I think K6000 because it wasn't easy to dig such a big hole. I bought 4 bags of cement too."
52,2022-10-01,84, **Interviewer**: How much was a bag of cement that time?," **Interviewee**: Now, we buy a bag of cement at K15000 here. Back then, I think we were buying a bag of cement at K7500. We did our best to do everything accordingly, so that if another digester was coming we should use the same things i.e. the hole. The hole has been intact for all these years; it's only now that it's damaged. So, it's hurts me that I lost a lot of money because of the coming of the digester."
52,2022-10-01,85, **Interviewer**: We are remaining with four questions. What special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: It was my first time to see a digester, and I didn't ask them where they got digesters. Is it that they got the digesters from Blantyre? Or, is it that they got it from a broad? I don't know. So, it was a strange thing here, and that's why many people were coming to see it. When the bag was full, people were even stopping their bicycles to go and see the bag. And, they would ask many questions about the digester and I would explain to them regarding its feeding and all that. It's sad that it didn't work, and that we lost money."
52,2022-10-01,86," **Interviewer**: I wanted to ask you if the digester helped you to save money or not. But, after listening to you talking it is clear, you lost a lot of money and you are deeply hurt by it. Roughly, how much money did you lost?"," **Interviewee**: It's a lot; K30000 for 4 bags of cement, K6000 for the bricks, K1200 for starts up water; I was paying the women K50 for a bucket; and a drum was taking it 6 or 8 buckets. So multiple that by 3, that's like K1200, and many other things. It was a lot of money."
52,2022-10-01,87, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: When the digester stopped working, I was deeply hurt. Why was I hurt, I was hurt because I trusted it with my heart that it was going to solve all my cooking needs, and I thought it was going to make cooking easy for me. So, even to date, I still want a reliable, simple and easy to start up cooking technology. Essentially, I want a technology that I can use, let's suppose at 8 pm after coming from the farm with ease, and without going around search for firewood. Now, I can\`t come home after 6 pm because that can affect our supper eating time. So, a thing like biogas is good because you can cook at any time of the day. We still want it, but it has to help. So, we want a technology that can help us, and the technology has to be better than the biogas digester we had."
52,2022-10-01,88," **Interviewer**: So, what do you think should be done to make it helpful?"," **Interviewee**: Our group was given digesters, and we have had another set of beneficiaries given solar technology, and they have been trained and everything is going smooth there. I have also heard that some people have been given a technology that uses gas and the gas cylinder looks like a mortar for maize pounding (LPG gas stoves). People are speaking highly of these things. They are saying it is easy to cook on them, and they are somewhat mobile, so you can move with them easily. I don't know this, and I have never seen it too. But, I think it is good."
52,2022-10-01,89, **Interviewer**: Do you think biogas has a future here or in Malawi at large?," **Interviewee**: I don't think it has a future because people didn't like it for the simple fact it worked badly and that nobody benefited from using it. If a marriage ends, and even if the husband was beating you but he was doing some of things good, you cry over your husband. But, biogas didn't help as in any way, so there is no way we can want it back, and we don't cry over it."
52,2022-10-01,90," **Interviewer**: Last question, if you could have chosen your own energy or waste Intervention, what would you have chosen instead? If feel like you have answered me this one, so if you can briefly go through it again to wrap up. You have talked of solar panel or LPG gas, so Apart from these was else could you have chosen?"," **Interviewee**: I hear people use electric stoves, but I have never seen that too. So, I think it's also a good alternative. Then, I would also consider solar panels; I think they are easy to use and effective as well. I have concerns with LPG gas because I have heard that when it runs out of gas, it doesn't work and you need money too. So, I don't think we can manage it. So, I think solar is better because it doesn't need money, and it's easy and cheap to maintain. You only need K1000 to buy the wire and the like. Another challenge with LPG gas is that it's hard to access. For example, here if you want to get gas you go to Migowi and that needs transport as well. So, I don't think it's manageable. So, solar is a better solution."
52,2022-10-01,91," **Interviewer**: Okay, do you have any last words?"," **Interviewee**: My last word is, I don't miss my ex husband \[biogas\]. And, I would like to have a new husband \[another cooking solution other than biogas\] (laughs). My ex husband \[biogas\] was bad -- and he didn't bear any children I can show and be proud of! \[Biogas didn't help in any way\]"
52,2022-10-01,92, **Interviewer**: (laughs) Interesting! Thanks for interview!,NA
53,2022-10-01,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?, **Interviewee**: It came by man called \[name redacted\].
53,2022-10-01,2," **Interviewer**: I think I know him. It must be \[name redacted\] from Intrinsic. Okay, who designed it?", **Interviewee**: It must be the same person.
53,2022-10-01,3," **Interviewer**: Okay, who funded it?", **Interviewee**: That I don\'t know.
53,2022-10-01,4, **Interviewer**: When was it built?," **Interviewee**: It was 2017, I believe."
53,2022-10-01,5, **Interviewer**: Who built it?," **Interviewee**: After the installers came, I was asked to dig a hole of 1-meter deep and 1-meter diameter. Then, they placed the bag in the hole -- it was a big hole!"
53,2022-10-01,6," **Interviewer**: So, who did the job?", **Interviewee**: I did the job.
53,2022-10-01,7, **Interviewer**: How many of you?," **Interviewee**: After I started digging, I saw that I could not manage, so I hired one person to finish the work."
53,2022-10-01,8, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay the person?, **Interviewee**: I paid him K1000.
53,2022-10-01,9, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to dig the hole?, **Interviewee**: It wasn't a lot of days. It took us three days.
53,2022-10-01,10, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came?, **Interviewee**: Three people came.
53,2022-10-01,11, **Interviewer**: How were you selected as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: It was just luck because the person who was supposed to get the digester from Machado village did not have cows, so they decided to give me. So, I was chosen because I had cows, as you know digesters cannot work without cow manure. Thus, it is not like I was chosen after a community meeting or something, no -- I was only considered because I had cows."
53,2022-10-01,12, **Interviewer**: What was your first encounter with the project implementers like?," **Interviewee**: The first time the project implementers came, they asked me about my welfare and then they told me that they wanted to help me... \[Briefly interrupted by a visitor\]. Then, I asked them how, and they said that they would bring a technology for cooking. After that, they came again with a certain woman. We fed the digester with feedstock and commissioned it. But, it only worked for 5 days, and then it stopped producing fire. Then, another group of people came, I think it was the third group to come, and they told us the digesters seemed not to work everywhere, so they were thinking of bringing solar panels -- so that's what happened!"
53,2022-10-01,13," **Interviewer**: So the first time they came, did they came alone as project implementers or they came with people from the community?"," **Interviewee**: They came with the person you are with, the former ADC (Area Development Committee) chairperson."
53,2022-10-01,14," **Interviewer**: Okay, so ADC members came?"," **Interviewee**: No, it was just him and them. So, they came like 4 people including him, and he came in his capacity as ADC Chair. And, that's when they started talking about bringing the equipment for cooking."
53,2022-10-01,15, **Interviewer**: You had the right to deny the technology. Why did you accept it to be built here?," **Interviewee**: I accepted it because I thought it was beneficial. Firewood is difficult to find here, so I expected to use it for cooking, and I was very excited to get a digester. And that time, as you can see, I was ready old and I had just lost my wife, so I expected it to help me personally by providing an alternative that would have stop me from going to the mountains to get firewood -- so, I was very grateful to get it."
53,2022-10-01,16, **Interviewer**: Did you know anything about biogas?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't know about biogas. No one here knew about it. It was my first time to see it - It was a first of its kind here in this village."
53,2022-10-01,17, **Interviewer**: So you became aware of biogas when they brought it here?, **Interviewee**: Yeah. I leant about it when they came and talked about it as I have said.
53,2022-10-01,18, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: I was very happy to get it. And, I had high expectations of it. I expected it to be beneficial."
53,2022-10-01,19, **Interviewer**: How beneficial?," **Interviewee**: I expected it to relieve the struggle we face in finding firewood for cooking; firewood is difficult to find, so we expected to cook with ease by its coming."
53,2022-10-01,20," **Interviewer**: I take it that they told you that you would be using it for cooking, what else?", **Interviewee**: They just told us that we would be using it for cooking food and boiling water for bathing.
53,2022-10-01,21, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you about lighting?," **Interviewee**: No. But, after it failed to work, they brought the idea of bringing a solar panel. So, I believe that's when we would have had an opportunity to use it for lighting."
53,2022-10-01,22, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that it produces digestate that you can use as fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't tell us. They only told us to feed it with manure, and that we should dig a hole at the outlet in which slurry would fall into. But, they didn't say anything about using the manure as fertilizer in our farms."
53,2022-10-01,23," **Interviewer**: So after everything was done, or before everything was done, what kind of training did you receive?"," **Interviewee**: No, we didn\'t."
53,2022-10-01,24," **Interviewer**: Then, how were you able to operate it?"," **Interviewee**: I asked them that if is it malfunctioned, what were we supposed to do, and they told me that we should report to the extension workers."
53,2022-10-01,25, **Interviewer**: Which ones?, **Interviewee**: The agriculture extension workers.
53,2022-10-01,26," **Interviewer**: Okay, fine. I imagine that it wasn't the only thing you were told. I mean, with that you wouldn't know how to operate it - how to turn it on and off and the like."," **Interviewee**: Okay, I understand. They called us to the kitchen where there was a stove, and then they showed us the button for turning it on and off. So, after turning it on, it was producing flames, and they told us to use a matchstick to light up the flames, if it failed to light up on its own -- that's what they told us."
53,2022-10-01,27, **Interviewer**: So there were times you were lighting it up without using a matchstick?," **Interviewee**: Yeah. It was lighting up the flames without striking a matchstick. But, sometimes it needed matchstick to light up the flames."
53,2022-10-01,28, **Interviewer**: Under what circumstances were you striking a matchstick to start up the flame?," **Interviewee**: When we turned it on and saw that no flame was lighted up, that's when we struck a matchstick to start the fire. So the matchstick was there only to boost and light up the gas when it couldn't on its own."
53,2022-10-01,29," **Interviewer**: Oh, I understand. So, you were taught how to start up the fire, and I can imagine you were told how to prepare..."," **Interviewee**: feedstock, yeah, we were told how to prepare feedstock -- yeah, they to us that."
53,2022-10-01,30, **Interviewer**: What did they say?," **Interviewee**: They told us that to make feedstock, we need fresh cow manure; add water, and then mix. Then, they told us that to make feedstock we need one bucket (20 liter) and add 4 buckets (20 liters) of water."
53,2022-10-01,31," **Interviewer**: So you were putting one bucket of cow manure like that one, and then add four buckets of that?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we were using a bucket of that size."
53,2022-10-01,32,Okay. How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: We used firewood for cooking. We were using the bluegum trees around. So, we used to cut the trees, and then dry them up as you can see there."
53,2022-10-01,33," **Interviewer**: Yeah, and I can also see a lot of bluegum tree here, and not just here, people here in general have bluegum trees. How did that come about?"," **Interviewee**: We planted these bluegum trees long ago, even though the mountains had trees had trees that time. We knew that the trees in the mountains were not ours, so that's why we planted our own. So, these are our private trees, and I feel like we were right in our thinking then. Because now you can't find a 3-meter tree in the mountains, so we only depend on these trees for firewood."
53,2022-10-01,34, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the trees? Did you get it from an NGO?, **Interviewee**: We got it from the government through the agriculture office.
53,2022-10-01,35," **Interviewer**: So when you want to cook you only use your trees,?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
53,2022-10-01,36, **Interviewer**: Is it enough?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we get enough. But, it's depleting because we have cut enough trees, so we need to plant more trees again."
53,2022-10-01,37, **Interviewer**: Do you buy charcoal?," **Interviewee**: No, I don't."
53,2022-10-01,38," **Interviewer**: By any chance, do you know how much firewood do you use in a month? Or, is it difficult to estimate?", **Interviewee**: We can't know because it's very hard to measure.
53,2022-10-01,39," **Interviewer**: You say you had cows, and I believe you still have them."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I still have."
53,2022-10-01,40," **Interviewer**: And, how did you manage your cow manure that time?", **Interviewee**: I was using it as fertilizer.
53,2022-10-01,41," **Interviewer**: Okay, does it works?"," **Interviewee**: It works, but you need to mix it with inorganic fertilizer to boost up its strength."
53,2022-10-01,42," **Interviewer**: Let's talk about how your digester worked. For a digester to work, it needs feeding. First, you feed it with large huge amount of feedstock to start it up. Then, you feed it regularly but this time the quantity differs from the first charge. How much feedstock did you start it up with?", **Interviewee**: We used two bags (50kg) of cow manure and large volume of water.
53,2022-10-01,43, **Interviewer**: Like how much water?, **Interviewee**: We used six water containers.
53,2022-10-01,44, **Interviewer**: Which containers?, **Interviewee**: Those ones!
53,2022-10-01,45," **Interviewer**: Oh, the plastic jelly cans \[20 liters\].", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
53,2022-10-01,46, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up? I mean you can't feed it and expect it to start working on the same day; it takes time for the process to start up and produce gas?," **Interviewee**: The same day the woman came to prepare feedstock, it was the same day that we started it."
53,2022-10-01,47, **Interviewer**: Mm-hmm," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it wasn't as if they said they would come another day -- it was the same day. It was not as they gave us a week or a year, no. It was the same day."
53,2022-10-01,48, **Interviewer**: How long did it take that day? Did they came in the morning and you started up in late in the afternoon?," **Interviewee**: No, it was around the same time they came. We just said fed it that day and after sometime we started up the stove."
53,2022-10-01,49, **Interviewer**: Same day?, **Interviewee**: Same day!
53,2022-10-01,50, **Interviewer**: Oh?," **Interviewee**: Yeah! It was the same day, for sure."
53,2022-10-01,51, **Interviewer**: They didn\'t give you time to commission it?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't say they would come back to commission it. It was the same day?"
53,2022-10-01,52," **Interviewer**: Let me get you clear on this. The first day you fed the digester with cow manure and water, was it the same day you commissioned it?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we commissioned it the same day. That was what happened!"
53,2022-10-01,53," **Interviewer**: Okay, okay. How did it work after commissioning? Or, how much cooking time did you get? Or, let me put it this way, what did you cook on that day?"," **Interviewee**: A cup of water started to heat up (less than 2 minutes), then it went off. The first time, it started with strong flames, then it started going down, and then it eventually went off. And, we didn't even cook nsima or side dish of anything."
53,2022-10-01,54," **Interviewer**: Okay, what happened on the second day?", **Interviewee**: It was the same thing. We didn't cook anything and it didn't even start.
53,2022-10-01,55, **Interviewer**: What was the gas for?, **Interviewee**: It was only for cooking.
53,2022-10-01,56," **Interviewer**: So, if you ever used it, that was when you tried to boil the water?", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
53,2022-10-01,57, **Interviewer**: That was tough," **Interviewee**: Very tough, indeed, because it was not easy to make the feedstock - it was hard work. Then, we saw that it couldn't help us, so we abandoned it."
53,2022-10-01,58, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the cow manure you used to start it up? Where did you get two the bags you used to start it up?, **Interviewee**: I got it from my cow house.
53,2022-10-01,59, **Interviewer**: How many cows did you have that time?," **Interviewee**: I had 15 cows, but now I have less."
53,2022-10-01,60," **Interviewer**: Now, how much do you have?", **Interviewee**: I have 14.
53,2022-10-01,61," **Interviewer**: Oh, you still have a lot. Where did you get the water?"," **Interviewee**: We got it from white house you can see there. They have a solar powered water pump, which pumps water from the ground."
53,2022-10-01,62, **Interviewer**: What's there?, **Interviewee**: A catholic priest resides there.
53,2022-10-01,63," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. That's like 800 meters from here. Did you buy?"," **Interviewee**: No, he just helped us."
53,2022-10-01,64, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: They told us that, if we wanted it to use it, we needed to feed it every day with cow manure and water -- and nothing else."
53,2022-10-01,65, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock were you supposed to feed it?," **Interviewee**: They advised us to feed it with one bucket (20 liter) of cow manure and two buckets (20 liters) of water every day -- Yeah, the water was supposed to be more than cow manure."
53,2022-10-01,66, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: We used to place cow manure in a bucket, add water, and then mix thoroughly to get suitable slurry. Then, we used to feed the digester through the white inlet pipe."
53,2022-10-01,67, **Interviewer**: How would you describe this task?," **Interviewee**: I found the job very tough. Had it been that it was working, then it could have been understandable. So, you just had to feel sorry for us. And, I felt like I was abused to do all that job without gaining something out at the end."
53,2022-10-01,68," **Interviewer**: Yeah, sorry for that. Who was responsible for feeding it?", **Interviewee**: I was the only person feeding it.
53,2022-10-01,69, **Interviewer**: What were maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us anything about maintenance. They only told us to feed it to get gas, and to dig at hole at the outlet to contain the digestate."
53,2022-10-01,70, **Interviewer**: How did you use the digestate?, **Interviewee**: We were simply throwing it away.
53,2022-10-01,71, **Interviewer**: Where?," **Interviewee**: Behind the kitchen, we had a refuse pit so that's where we used to dispose of the digestate."
53,2022-10-01,72," **Interviewer**: And, you have told me that you were told to consult the agriculture extension workers whenever there was a problem, right? So, if thing that had to do with maintenance was in the hands of the agriculture office, I suppose.", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
53,2022-10-01,73," **Interviewer**: My next question was to ask you if it met your needs, but clearly, it didn't..."," **Interviewee**: It didn't indeed. We never cooked nsima on it, no even once! My wish was to use it in the morning, at lunch to cook nsima, and in the evening to cook as well. But, it never did. I didn't even use it boil water!"
53,2022-10-01,74, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?, **Interviewee**: The only problem we face with it is that it didn't produce fire -- it didn't work.
53,2022-10-01,75," **Interviewer**: If you saw fire that was only after commissioning and that was for less than 2 or 3 minutes, and after that it never worked.", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
53,2022-10-01,76," **Interviewer**: How did the fire go off that 2 or 3 minutes? Did it go off at once, or it declined and eventually stopped?"," **Interviewee**: The fire was going down slowly. It only worked for 2 minutes. And after that, I tried to feed it, but it didn't work. I fed it for 3 days then I stopped feeding it and that was its end."
53,2022-10-01,77," **Interviewer**: So, when you said you used it for 5 days, you mean interacted with it for 5 days but never used it?", **Interviewee**: Definitely!
53,2022-10-01,78," **Interviewer**: Why didn't you feed for a week or so, and then see that what was going to happen?"," **Interviewee**: I feel like I was committed and did my best to feed it for 3 days, but nothing happened. So, I knew that it was not going to work."
53,2022-10-01,79, **Interviewer**: How can I see your commitment when you fed it for just 3 days?," **Interviewee**: I fed it first day with loads of feedstock, and the day or two after I fed it also. The following day, I fed it also. So I feel like I tried. I wouldn't have kept on when I was seeing any results."
53,2022-10-01,80, **Interviewer**: What went wrong? Did you notice any leakage in the pipes?," **Interviewee**: There wasn't many pipes. It was just one pipe, which traveled from the bag to the stove."
53,2022-10-01,81, **Interviewer**: What happened after?," **Interviewee**: I had their numbers too, so when I called them they were just like they would come."
53,2022-10-01,82," **Interviewer**: And, they didn't come?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, never."
53,2022-10-01,83, **Interviewer**: Did you report to the agriculture office?," **Interviewee**: No, I just reported directly."
53,2022-10-01,84, **Interviewer**: Why? I thought the told you to report to them.," **Interviewee**: I didn't interact with the agriculture at any point in the installation of this, so I did think of them."
53,2022-10-01,85, **Interviewer**: But that was what you were told.," **Interviewee**: Yeah. But, I believe that if I had interacted with, I believe I would have."
53,2022-10-01,86, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this \[Table of intervention\]?, **Interviewee**: No.
53,2022-10-01,87," **Interviewer**: This is information about common problems of biogas, their causes and solutions. What do you think of the information and do you think it would have helped?"," **Interviewee**: The installers never said that the digester malfunctions. And, they didn't explain to us how to respond to any problem. They only told us to consult the extension workers when there was a problem. Then, they also told us how to switch it on. And, it was not difficult to start it up the fire -- it was easy."
53,2022-10-01,88, **Interviewer**: Has anyone else to come to follow up on the digester?," **Interviewee**: No, one has ever come."
53,2022-10-01,89," **Interviewer**: So if you were given information on how to respond to problem, do you think the information on would have helped you?"," **Interviewee**: It's a very important because it would have given us a clue on how to respond to the problem. As I have said, I didn\'t do anything to solve the problem. So maybe if I had such information, I would have tried my best to fix it"
53,2022-10-01,90," **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of your digester? In other words, if the installers call you today on your phone to find out about the digester, what would you tell them?"," **Interviewee**: I would inform them the digester is not working, and I'm sure they know that it's not working because they left it not working. And, the last time they were here, we talked about it, and that's why they said they would bring solar panels (laughs). They saw the pot of water failing to boil, and they admitted that it didn't work, and that's when they brought the idea of solar panels. That was their last words, and that was their goodbye."
53,2022-10-01,91," **Interviewer**: How did it reach this stage? And, what cause it?"," **Interviewee**: I don't know why it failed. We were told to make feedstock, we did and fed it, but it didn't work. So, I don't why it didn't work."
53,2022-10-01,92, **Interviewer**: It wrong to suggest the installers had no technical skill to install it and make work?," **Interviewee**: After it did not work, I asked the installers if they had installed the digesters anywhere else and worked. And they responded that the digesters work, and I told them that it's not good to give someone something that's useless. Then, I quizzed them if they had installed the digesters somewhere else and worked, and that's when they brushed me off saying that the digesters work. So, I did question their capabilities, and they responded that the digesters work."
53,2022-10-01,93, **Interviewer**: How do you meet your energy needs now that it's not working?, **Interviewee**: We still use firewood.
53,2022-10-01,94, **Interviewer**: How do you manage your feedstock now?," **Interviewee**: We use it as fertilizer in our fields. So what we do is, we get the manure and place the manure between ridges. Then, we make new ridges between the old ridges."
53,2022-10-01,95, **Interviewer**: Okay. How much did the reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't tell us."
53,2022-10-01,96, **Interviewer**: Did they inform you who funded it?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't."
53,2022-10-01,97, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?," **Interviewee**: No, I only dug the hole."
53,2022-10-01,98, **Interviewer**: Did you line the hole?," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't."
53,2022-10-01,99, **Interviewer**: Why not? You weren't told?," **Interviewee**: We saw that we would waste cement. And, out of the beneficiaries, I think it was only one person who lined it. It didn't make sense to use it for a week and line it with a brick wall or plaster."
53,2022-10-01,100, **Interviewer**: Were you told to line it before installation or after installation?," **Interviewee**: At whatever point, we could have lined it up. So, when it didn't work, we didn't even think of lining it."
53,2022-10-01,101," **Interviewer**: Apart from digging the hole, sourcing water and cow manure, what else did you do?"," **Interviewee**: No, that was all."
53,2022-10-01,102, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?, **Interviewee**: They didn't discuss that with us.
53,2022-10-01,103, **Interviewer**: What's your take though?," **Interviewee**: I have never seen it in any store, so that makes me think it's from abroad."
53,2022-10-01,104," **Interviewer**: My next question was to ask you if it helped you to save money or helped, but it's clear, it didn't save you any money or helped you in any way..."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I only wasted my energy."
53,2022-10-01,105," **Interviewer**: And, even the money used to hire the person who helped you to dig the hole. If you could meet the installers today, what would you say to them?"," **Interviewee**: I can't thank them because we were helped in any way. If it had worked for some time and then stopped, I would have thanked them. I can't thank them for what they did -- what should I thank them for? (Laughs)"
53,2022-10-01,106, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is much needed, but it's sad that it didn't work. If it had worked, it would have helped us a lot"
53,2022-10-01,107," **Interviewer**: Why was it much needed, and how could it have helped you?", **Interviewee**: It could have helped us to meet our cooking needs.
53,2022-10-01,108, **Interviewer**: What's the future of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is very helpful in improving livelihood. So, I would like to see it continuing."
53,2022-10-01,109," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I would have chosen a solar powered stove, and not a stove that uses firewood."
53,2022-10-01,110, **Interviewer**: Why?," **Interviewee**: It has more benefits than woodstoves. Wood stoves take time for igniting. So, that's why a solar powered stove is better than a woodstove."
53,2022-10-01,111," **Interviewer**: Yeah, maybe solar is really a good alternative, and even the installers recommend solar. What are your last words?"," **Interviewee**: I thank you for coming. What I've said about the digester not helping us, I would have also told the installer, if they had come. So, thanks for coming, and if you can have a chance to meet them, you can tell them that we thanked them for nothing and for a useless thing. So, thanks for coming you have helped us to release our concerns and cries.... What happened is a sad story, a very sad story. We expected to benefit, but we didn't anything from it -- overall, I feel like a digester is a very beneficial thing."
53,2022-10-01,112, **Interviewer**: It's really a sad story., **Interviewee**: and you just have to feel sorry.
53,2022-10-01,113," **Interviewer**: Yeah, some of the things sound dramatic and funny, but it's really unfortunate that it happened. Thanks for the interview.",NA
54,2022-10-01,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: The project implementers told us that they were trying out the digesters, and that they came from Chancellor College."
54,2022-10-01,2, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?, **Interviewee**: They did not tell us the organization that provided the money. They just told us that they wanted to try out the digesters.
54,2022-10-01,3, **Interviewer**: Who built it?," **Interviewee**: I have just forgotten. I think his name was \[name redacted\], I'm not sure though."
54,2022-10-01,4, **Interviewer**: Let me put it this way. How many people from the installation company came?," **Interviewee**: There were two people. Every beneficiary had two installers, so the whole team was composed of eight or ten people who went four or five other beneficiaries. I remember that the name of man as \[name redacted\], but I don't remember the name of the woman. I am sure husband would have remembered their names, because he was the one who was interacting with them."
54,2022-10-01,5, **Interviewer**: What was your role?," **Interviewee**: When the installers came, they simply advise us to dig a 1-meter hole. After that, they placed the digester bag in the hole, and then assembled the outlet and inlet pipes as well as a green pipe and a stove. Then, they advised us to make me feedstock and feed the digester afterwards. We fed the digester bag with two drums of cow manure, and we waited for a week to start using it."
54,2022-10-01,6, **Interviewer**: How many people from side did the work?, **Interviewee**: Three people dug the hole; my husband and my two boys.
54,2022-10-01,7, **Interviewer**: How long did it take them?," **Interviewee**: The soil was dry and compact that time, so it took them four days."
54,2022-10-01,8," **Interviewer**: So after a week or so, they came to place the bag and assemble the pipes and the other fittings?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
54,2022-10-01,9, **Interviewer**: We have so many people and households in this community. How were you selected as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: They told us the community had many people, but they wanted people who interested and willing to manage the digester. So, we were basically chosen because of our interest and commitment."
54,2022-10-01,10," **Interviewer**: What was the selection process? Or, how were they able to separate the willing and committed from those who weren't willing?"," **Interviewee**: There was no selection procedure. I think \[name redacted\] \[Area Development Committee chair\] identified and selected us based on our activeness in doing things. I think, I was the only one in \[location redacted\] that was chosen. But, in total about 10 people were chosen in T/A \[Traditional Authority\] Chiwalo. Thus, for a start, they wanted 10 people. After that, more people would have been chosen. Thus, there was no selection procedure; they just chose people who they thought were active under the recommendation of \[name redacted\]. Also, they chose people who were at least close to me road, so that the project implementers could easily reach them."
54,2022-10-01,11, **Interviewer**: Is it true that you are active or you were active?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it's true."
54,2022-10-01,12, **Interviewer**: How can I believe that?," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) you can believe this by the simple fact that I've told you that you haven't found everything intact because my husband passed on. My husband was a hard-working man, and if he was alive, you would have found everything."
54,2022-10-01,13," **Interviewer**: So, he was always involved in community projects?", **Interviewee**: He was always active and present in every community project.
54,2022-10-01,14, **Interviewer**: Like which projects?, **Interviewee**: In every community project.
54,2022-10-01,15, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: They told us that they were trying out the digester, so were expecting to benefit at the end of it. So, at the end, we expected to use it for cooking."
54,2022-10-01,16, **Interviewer**: So they made it clear to you that you were trying out the digester?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they told us that they were from Chanco and were trying out the digesters. So, we had huge expectation to see what was going to happen -- so, we were expecting lights too."
54,2022-10-01,17," **Interviewer**: Even though they were trying out the digester, I believe there were some things you were told to expect from the digester. What were you told to expect by the installers?"," **Interviewee**: We used it for cooking. And, they told us that in modern age people should not rely on firewood for cooking. Instead, we should start relying on biogas for cooking to conserve for the environment. That is what they told us."
54,2022-10-01,18, **Interviewer**: Do you think biogas is the way to protect the environment?," **Interviewee**: Biogas is a way to save the environment. Nowadays, we don't have trees in the mountains because of high population growth. So, biogas is a good solution to that especially to people who are interested and committed to use it and to save the environment."
54,2022-10-01,19, **Interviewer**: So you think people need to be committed to realize its potential?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, people need to be keen on this, and committed too to realize its potential. But, if people like you want to advance the project, you should consider bringing solar panels to overcome the difficulties we faced. The main challenge we had with biogas that time was sourcing manure -- it is very hard to source cow manure. So, we would like to have a solution like solar technology and we would appreciate it a lot."
54,2022-10-01,20," **Interviewer**: Okay, what kind of training did you receive?"," **Interviewee**: We didn't receive any at all, and I just feel like the project implementers were not committed and lazy in their doing. They didn't tell us how to fix it. If there was any problem, when we tried to call them, they didn't respond - The installers were very lazy -- they just installed the digester and left. So, when we started using it, we didn't know what to do; how to act and where to go, if it stopped functioning -- they were so lazy."
54,2022-10-01,21," **Interviewer**: When you say lazy, what do you mean? Could you please elaborate on that?"," **Interviewee**: I'm saying this because they just installed it and showed us how to use it. But, they never came back to follow up and see what was happening."
54,2022-10-01,22," **Interviewer**: Apart from being taught how to use it, and make feedstock, what else?"," **Interviewee**: They taught us how to control the fire on the stove. Also, they told us that after feeding it, we should be waiting up to 12:00 noon after to use it. They digester relied on the sun; when the sun was out cooking easy."
54,2022-10-01,23," **Interviewer**: When they brought the digester, you had the right to say no. you could have said thanks, but it's involving, no. Why did you accept to build the digester here?", **Interviewee**: I accepted it because a person doesn't refuse development; no one denies development from government -- no way! You can't say no development.
54,2022-10-01,24, **Interviewer**: Why shouldn't person say no to Development?," **Interviewee**: The government is there to serve the people. There job is to look after our lives. So if the government decided to try the digesters here, we wouldn't have said no."
54,2022-10-01,25, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: I didn't know about biogas. So it was not like a thing we wanted. At that time, as a less privileged community, we wanted electricity from Escom. We envy people living in communities where there are electricity lines, without electricity people a hard life. We live a hard life here."
54,2022-10-01,26," **Interviewer**: Oh, you live a hard life?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
54,2022-10-01,27, **Interviewer**: How?," **Interviewee**: We live a hard life. As you can see, there is no electricity in this community and the road is very here. I think you have seen it yourself."
54,2022-10-01,28," **Interviewer**: Yeah, it\`s bad. How did you meet your energy needs that time?"," **Interviewee**: I was using maize stalks. Sometimes, I was using firewood."
54,2022-10-01,29, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the firewood?, **Interviewee**: We get it from the forest
54,2022-10-01,30, **Interviewer**: Which forest?," **Interviewee**: We get it from the forests around the mountain. But, forest officials protect them."
54,2022-10-01,31," **Interviewer**: So, what do you do?"," **Interviewee**: We sometimes get tree branches from within -- we cut trees from within, dry them and use them as firewood."
54,2022-10-01,32," **Interviewer**: And, sometimes you just sneak into the forests?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah (laughs). We just wait for them to knock off and go... In regards to training, frankly speaking, I didn't go for training, and if they can say they want people to go for training, I would really appreciate it, if I could go."
54,2022-10-01,33, **Interviewer**: You want training?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I want training."
54,2022-10-01,34, **Interviewer**: How would you want training when the digester is dead?," **Interviewee**: I want to learn about biogas, and I would also like to tell them my concerns and grievances -- I would like to tell them to bring solar panels and electricity to use for cooking."
54,2022-10-01,35," **Interviewer**: Why are community people, so obsessed with trainings?"," **Interviewee**: Development can't come without training. For example, in your case you can't just come and say I want to do this and that. What you do is you would brief the people on your research, and then you need to train the people to know what exactly what they are supposed to do -- so that's it goes!"
54,2022-10-01,36," **Interviewer**: I can't agree more. Let me put it to you; you are saying you want to go for biogas training, but it sounds to me like you don't want biogas, you want solar panels or electricity. So my question, do you want the training to learn biogas or something else i.e. the money?"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) No, we just go there! (Laughs heavily) So, the money is just part of it. I mean, they can't just keep you there without food allowance. We just go there with a heart to learn, but you money just comes in because they can\'t just make you sit for hours for nothing. Thus, they give the money to us to buy food, and to buy other necessities like soap. That's how it is."
54,2022-10-01,37, **Interviewer**: (Laughs) great! Do you buy charcoal?," **Interviewee**: No, I don\'t"
54,2022-10-01,38, **Interviewer**: Why not?, **Interviewee**: I don't have the money to buy charcoal.
54,2022-10-01,39," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you have cows when the digester was installed here?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, I had."
54,2022-10-01,40, **Interviewer**: How did you manage the feedstock i.e. the cow manure?, **Interviewee**: We use it as fertilizer in our fields.
54,2022-10-01,41," **Interviewer**: Some people say it doesn't help, so how do you use it?"," **Interviewee**: Fertilizer is expensive these days, so you can't say it does help. So, after harvesting, we go put the manure in the fields, and when it's time to make ridge, we just mix it together with the soil."
54,2022-10-01,42, **Interviewer**: Do you add in organic fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: If it's available we do, but fertilizer is hard to find."
54,2022-10-01,43, **Interviewer**: So when your name is included in the list of agriculture input subsidy programme beneficiaries you do?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, definitely!"
54,2022-10-01,44, **Interviewer**: Let's talk about how it worked and how you started it up. How much feedstock did you start it up with?," **Interviewee**: As I mentioned earlier, we started it up with it six bags (50kgs) of fresh cow manure and two drums (200 liters) of water."
54,2022-10-01,45, **Interviewer**: That's a lot of manure. How did you manage to get all that manure?," **Interviewee**: I got three bags from my cow house, and the rest I got from other people."
54,2022-10-01,46, **Interviewer**: Like how far from here?, **Interviewee**: It's far; I got it from Ching'ani village.
54,2022-10-01,47, **Interviewer**: How far is it?," **Interviewee**: When my boys went to collect manure on a bicycle around 9 or 10, they were coming somewhere after 12 noon."
54,2022-10-01,48, **Interviewer**: Did you buy the manure?," **Interviewee**: No, but if it was these days I'm sure they would have been selling us at K250 a bag."
54,2022-10-01,49, **Interviewer**: (laughs) what has changed?, **Interviewee**: Everything is about money these days; only a greeting is free these days
54,2022-10-01,50, **Interviewer**: (laughs) where did you get the water?," **Interviewee**: We have two boreholes in this community; one is there and the other one is at the end of the village. That's like 300 meters. But, it was a lot of work and we even asked girls from neighbors to help us."
54,2022-10-01,51, **Interviewer**: Did you pay them?, **Interviewee**: What could we have paid them with? And it's good that not everything was about money that time.
54,2022-10-01,52," **Interviewer**: Okay, how long did it take to start up?", **Interviewee**: They only waited for 3 days to commission it after feeding it with the first charge.
54,2022-10-01,53, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: At the first, it didn't work, then we called an \[name redacted\], then it started working."
54,2022-10-01,54, **Interviewer**: Was it the same day you commissioned it?," **Interviewee**: No, it was a different day."
54,2022-10-01,55," **Interviewer**: So that time you tried it, were the installers or \[name redacted\] there?"," **Interviewee**: No, they weren't there. They just told us how to start it."
54,2022-10-01,56," **Interviewer**: So you were told how to start it, and that you should start it after 3 days?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they told us to start it up when the bag was full."
54,2022-10-01,57," **Interviewer**: So, when tried it up and saw that it wasn't working you called \[name redacted\]?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, then he suggested to my husband that maybe he was doing something wrong, and he told him the correct way of doing it. And, when he did what he was told, it worked."
54,2022-10-01,58, **Interviewer**: What was the problem?," **Interviewee**: My husband was doing that, so I don't know where he got it wrong. But, I think he said something like a pipe or gas valve at the kitchen was the problem."
54,2022-10-01,59," **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning? Or, how much cooking time did you get?"," **Interviewee**: It worked the quite okay, but it had problems when there was no sunlight. So every time we say that the bag was full we were using it."
54,2022-10-01,60, **Interviewer**: Let's talk about the cooking time were getting? Were you able to cook porridge or tea in the morning?," **Interviewee**: I was able to cook porridge (15 - 20 minutes), but only after 9 o'clock when the sun was out -- it was working when there was sunlight."
54,2022-10-01,61, **Interviewer**: How was your cooking like in a day?," **Interviewee**: In the morning, I had issues as I was waiting for the sun. In the afternoon, I was able to cooknsima and side dish (1 -- 1 hour 30 minutes). But, in the evening when the sun was gone, the bag was shrinking and it wasn't working."
54,2022-10-01,62, **Interviewer**: How long did you use it?," **Interviewee**: Like I said, we used it for two years."
54,2022-10-01,63," **Interviewer**: Oh, you mean in two years you were able to cook nsima, side dish and porridge."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, for two year."
54,2022-10-01,64," **Interviewer**: Aaah, then you are the first person to use it that long."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and you can even ask \[name redacted\] there. He even used his for quite a long time too."
54,2022-10-01,65, **Interviewer**: Mmmh?, **Interviewee**: Yeah
54,2022-10-01,66, **Interviewer**: You are the first person to use it the long...," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but when it stopped working when we called them they didn't come. And, that\'s why I have said that the installers were lazy people."
54,2022-10-01,67, **Interviewer**: How did you use the gas?, **Interviewee**: He used to the gas for cooking only.
54,2022-10-01,68, **Interviewer**: How many people used the gas?, **Interviewee**: Six people.
54,2022-10-01,69, **Interviewer**: What were maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: It didn't require a lot of things. After feeding it with six bags of manure and two drums during the first charge, they advised us to feed it with 2 buckets (40 liters) of cow manure every day. So every day we were feeding it, and waiting for 9 o'clock to start using it. So that's how it worked."
54,2022-10-01,70, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add?, **Interviewee**: The water was included in the 2 bucket; I was placing about half cow manure in a bucket and then I filled water in the bucket until suitable slurry was reached.
54,2022-10-01,71, **Interviewer**: How were you doing it?," **Interviewee**: My son, I was doing that with my hands and without gloves (laughs). After feeding, that's when we washed our hands."
54,2022-10-01,72," **Interviewer**: Oh, you think gloves were necessary?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, but we still used bare hands because they didn't give us gloves."
54,2022-10-01,73," **Interviewer**: Did you feel that it was unhealthy? And, didn't you feel disgusting?"," **Interviewee**: Mm-hmm, I remember one time health officials came, and they asked us and saw how we were preparing feedstock. Then, they said it was unhygienic and didn't agree with that. Then, I told them that you are coming from government, and the people who brought it here came from the government as well, so if it's unhygienic then it's the government that has brought poor hygiene here.... I remember, they were like our compound was looking unpleasant and that it was attracting a lot of flies - and I told them that the government that brought the digester and it didn't come of our own accord. So, if we would get diseases, it's the government's fault."
54,2022-10-01,74," **Interviewer**: So, what happened?"," **Interviewee**: They didn\'t do anything, we told them straight facts."
54,2022-10-01,75, **Interviewer**: How did you design the outlet?," **Interviewee**: We just dug a hole, so that digestate would flow into."
54,2022-10-01,76,What were you doing with the digestate?, **Interviewee**: They told us that we could use it as a fertilizer.
54,2022-10-01,77, **Interviewer**: Did you use it as fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I did."
54,2022-10-01,78, **Interviewer**: Did it work?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it did."
54,2022-10-01,79, **Interviewer**: Did you pre-treat the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: No, we were using fresh manure, so we used to do everything on the spot."
54,2022-10-01,80, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: It was me together with my girls and boys. And, they didn't express any resentment of handling cow manure."
54,2022-10-01,81, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: They didn't express resentment because they were doing what was best for their lives in that moment.
54,2022-10-01,82, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: That's why I say the installers were lazy people. And if we are not using biogas today, it's because the installers didn't train us. If they had taken the beneficiaries for training to teach them how to fix issues, then things would have been different today."
54,2022-10-01,83, **Interviewer**: Did you meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it did. It very much met my needs. In the late morning hours, I was able to prepare breakfast, warm water for bathing. In the afternoon, I was able cook nsima and side dish. It was only not working in evening because it needed the sun to work. They bag was never full when there was no sunlight and it wasn't working."
54,2022-10-01,84, **Interviewer**: What time did you see the bag shrinking?," **Interviewee**: The bag was shrinking after 4 PM, when the sun was going down."
54,2022-10-01,85, **Interviewer**: Was it shrinking completely? Was the bag still appearing above the ground?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was appearing above ground, it just that it wasn't completely full as when there was sunlight."
54,2022-10-01,86, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your needs in the evening?, **Interviewee**: I was getting tree branches from the trees around.
54,2022-10-01,87, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: The one problem is what I have already told you, it was very hard to find cow manure. The other thing was that health officials didn't agree with its hygiene aspect. So, that's why I have said that if this project is continuing they should consider bringing solar panels... But, the main challenge was on sourcing manure. On top of this, we had also a minor problem that concerned children. The children liked to smear themselves with the cow dung when we were making feedstock."
54,2022-10-01,88," **Interviewer**: You have told me that you had cow house, then how come you had challenges in sourcing cow manure?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, we had a cow house, but we had very few cows. So it was hard for us to collect the two buckets of cow manure in a day. And, the surprising thing was that our two cows pooped more when they were outside the cow house. So, it was tough to gather all the manure together."
54,2022-10-01,89," **Interviewer**: (laughs) when it rains, it pours. So, how did you cope?"," **Interviewee**: Fearing that would sleep on an empty stomach, we were going around seeking for cow manure from people who had cows. So, when we added that manure with what we had it was somehow working. And when we saw that the fire was dying we were trying as much as possible to go fast, and when then fire was eventually off we used firewood."
54,2022-10-01,90," **Interviewer**: So, this is how it was in its entire working life?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, yeah, but in some cases we were able to get the manure from our cow house."
54,2022-10-01,91, **Interviewer**: How did it stop working?," **Interviewee**: Strong winds blew the roof off and ended up cutting off the green pipe. The cut was so severe that we couldn't fix it. After that, we called the project implementers numerous times to report what happened, and that we couldn't manage to fix it, but to no avail. So, they never came and we eventually gave up."
54,2022-10-01,92, **Interviewer**: Was the call going through or not?," **Interviewee**: When we called them, theirs number couldn't be reached. I don't know if they changed their numbers or something."
54,2022-10-01,93, **Interviewer**: Where exactly was the pipe damaged?," **Interviewee**: Our kitchen roof that year was blown off by strong winds, and it damaged the pipe, so we couldn't have managed to do fix it. And that\'s when we called the project implemented to come and fix it. But, they never came and that's why we abandoned it."
54,2022-10-01,94, **Interviewer**: Did you get smell of gas around?, **Interviewee**: We were getting odor at the outlet after an overflow even before the pipes got damaged. And that's why healthy officials were against it.
54,2022-10-01,95, **Interviewer**: So it took two years?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we used it for 2 years."
54,2022-10-01,96," **Interviewer**: Before I get to my next question, I want to be clear on this. Did you use it for 2 years? How much cooking time did you get in those 2 years?"," **Interviewee**: We used it for two years, of course. If we had breakfast food, we were using it in the morning and at lunch. But, in the evening, we were not able to use it. So, sometimes when we went to the fields, we would find the children cooking on biogas -- so it was a joy tohave it."
54,2022-10-01,97, **Interviewer**: That was amazing.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was so easy to use; you couldn't notice that pot had been on the stove as it was clean and; it was more like cooking on an electric stove."
54,2022-10-01,98, **Interviewer**: Have something like this?, **Interviewee**: No.
54,2022-10-01,99," **Interviewer**: This is information regarding common problems associated with digesters, their causes and solutions. What do you think about this kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?", **Interviewee**: It would have helped us a lot.
54,2022-10-01,100, **Interviewer**: How or why?," **Interviewee**: I\'ll give you an example. We had a washproject by water mission there, and the project implementers took people for training. They did train people on operation and maintenance of the water facility. At the end, people were able to maintain the facility. Also, in this community, we have a certain man called \[name redacted\]; he is very active and interested in such things, so organizations usually get him to trainings. And, indeed, he fixes many problems in this community. So if they had given us such information, or even if they had trained, few individuals on maintenance like on the water mission project, we would have reached to those people to help us fix the problem."
54,2022-10-01,101," **Interviewer**: You have said that projects that come here usually involve trainings, and I totally agree with you that most projects of this nature involve trainings. And, I personally think that a project of this magnitude and nature should have had some sort of training for things to work. Why do you think this project had no trainings?", **Interviewee**: I don't know why. I just don't know why. And we had no opportunity to ask them why they didn't train us.
54,2022-10-01,102," **Interviewer**: We are in October; let's suppose the project implementers call you today to find out about the digester, what would you say to them?"," **Interviewee**: I would tell them that the digester you gave me it's no longer working. It stopped working because strong winds blew off the roof and eventually cut off the green pipe. Then, I called you but you didn't come. So, I'm not currently using the digester because you did not give me the expertise to maintain it."
54,2022-10-01,103, **Interviewer**: What was key cause to the failure of your digester?," **Interviewee**: The problem is not the project implementers were lazy people. If the project implementers were not lazy and if they were coming to follow up on us, I'm sure many people would have adopted the digesters. And, I feel like we are not to blame for its failure, and that the project implementers are totally responsible."
54,2022-10-01,104," **Interviewer**: It sounds like when you want to cook these days you use the same old methods --you use firewood, maize stalks, right?", **Interviewee**: That's true.
54,2022-10-01,105," **Interviewer**: And you still use cow manure as fertilizer in the fields, right,?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
54,2022-10-01,106, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of the interview. How much did reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: Honestly speaking, I don't know anything about that. Maybe my husband was told, but I'm not aware. Or, maybe \[name redacted\] knows."
54,2022-10-01,107," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you contribute anything in kind?"," **Interviewee**: No, we only contributed human power, which we used in digging the hole, and in sourcing and preparing feedstock. And we had no problems with that because it was our thing."
54,2022-10-01,108," **Interviewer**: Again, who dug it?", **Interviewee**: My husband dug it with the support of my two boys.
54,2022-10-01,109, **Interviewer**: You didn't hire anyone else to help you dig?," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't."
54,2022-10-01,110," **Interviewer**: Did you line the hole? Or, was any masonry work involved?", **Interviewee**: No.
54,2022-10-01,111, **Interviewer**: Were you told you to line it?," **Interviewee**: No, we weren't told. But, we had the plans to build a structure of bricks and cement for the stove. It didn't happen because we had no money to buy cement."
54,2022-10-01,112," **Interviewer**: Apart from digging the hole, sourcing the feedstock and preparing the feedstock, what other tasks did you do?"," **Interviewee**: Nothing, that was all."
54,2022-10-01,113, **Interviewer**: What special items have to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: I should say that I know. But, I think the bag is outside the country."
54,2022-10-01,114, **Interviewer**: Why do you think the bag might have been from outside?, **Interviewee**: I think the bag was written that it was from China.
54,2022-10-01,115, **Interviewer**: (laughs) so you think the bag is from China and not Phalombe?," **Interviewee**: If it was from Phalombe, I would have know. So, I think the bag is from abroad."
54,2022-10-01,116, **Interviewer**: I have to say that out of all the people I have talked to you are the one who has used it for long. It is kind of surreal to me. So in those two years did it help you to save money?," **Interviewee**: A lot. Since, we stopped relying on firewood. And, even when there was rain, we didn't worry about using wet wood."
54,2022-10-01,117, **Interviewer**: Two years is a lot of time. How did it work during the rainy season and summer? Did it differ?, **Interviewee**: We were still using it in rain season long as the sun shone after the rain; it needs the sun to work.
54,2022-10-01,118," **Interviewer**: Here in Malawi, sometimes it rains all day, and sometimes it can stay for a week without the sun shining especially during the rainy and wet season. What were you doing after that?", **Interviewee**: We had to find plans to cook -- so we were forced to cook using firewood.
54,2022-10-01,119," **Interviewer**: So, it wasn't working sometimes?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, the bag wasn't getting full. It needs the sun. So, it wasn't working."
54,2022-10-01,120," **Interviewer**: Did you feed it in rain season? i.e. when it was raining maybe for 3 or 5 days continuous when their was no sun, did you fed it?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, we were still feeding it because we knew that once we stopped feeding it wouldn't produce gas. As a result, we wouldn't be able to cook after the sun was out."
54,2022-10-01,121, **Interviewer**: What was the biggest change in your life when it was working?, **Interviewee**: The biggest change was that when we went to the fields we did bother to look for firewood to cook afterwards. We were simply turning on biogas.
54,2022-10-01,122, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: Biogas was good to our lives as it was helping us a lot in terms of cooking. And we still want that type of cooking, so we would really appreciate it if they could give us a solar panels this time. So, that's our wish."
54,2022-10-01,123," **Interviewer**: You are talking highly of Biogas, but you seem you want solar panels more than biogas, why don't you want to keep using Biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Like I said, we had challenges in finding cow manure. Also, nowadays everything is about money, so you can't go about asking for manure, people would obviously charge money, maybe K500 a bucket. So, that's why we want solar technology because you can't pay for the sun. Whom would you pay for the sun? (Laughs)"
54,2022-10-01,124," **Interviewer**: You have answered my next question, but I will still ask you maybe to confirm you answer and maybe you can add something on it. If you could have chosen your own energy or waste intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: You can only ask you for electricity. I can\'t ask you for anything else, for example, water tap because if I ask for that it wouldn't reach me first, but the chief. But, if it's electricity, it will reach out to a lot of people and not just the chiefs."
54,2022-10-01,125, **Interviewer**: Then how were you able to get biogas? Why didn't it go to the chief the first?," **Interviewee**: It\'s because it needs a lot of effort, you can't just say I'll get it, it needs commitment to make it work. And lucky enough that time my husband was very active and hard working."
54,2022-10-01,126, **Interviewer**: To cook on electricity you need money. Can you manage?, **Interviewee**: The government could see how best it would help us.
54,2022-10-01,127, **Interviewer**: You want the government to do bring electricity and electric stoves as well?, **Interviewee**: (laughs) they would need to bring both for sure.
54,2022-10-01,128," **Interviewer**: Then, let's just go for solar panels, maybe. Why do you exact want a solar technology?"," **Interviewee**: I'm choosing a solar panel because it's cheaper than electricity. Electricity is expensive; you need to pay bill and all that. So, I think a solar technology is better than electricity."
54,2022-10-01,129," **Interviewer**: That was my last question. Before I go, what are your last words?"," **Interviewee**: If the project implementers are still around and you communicate with them, ask them to take \[name redacted\] for training -- we want development here."
54,2022-10-01,130, **Interviewer**: Noted. Thanks for the interview \[name redacted\].,NA
55,2022-10-01,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: I simply saw \[name redacted\] coming here to ask me if I was interested to own a digester. I told him I would like to own it, and I told my boys about it and they said if the digester was going to help us cook then we should go for it. Then we started sourcing manure and bricks, and if I'm not mistaken, I spent about K25000 on that. Then after that, I was buyingcow manure every day to feed the digester, so I was spending about K300 a day because I had no cows that time. So, I can say we spent a lot of money on feedstock and on trying toline the hole, but I only used it even to cook side dish of fish \[20 minutes\] -- And, I couldn't even boil water for bathing after (laughs) -- It was even failing to heat up water, imagine (laughs)."
55,2022-10-01,2, **Interviewer**: Not even water?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, then, we went to the person who brought it here, \[name redacted\] to tell him that they had given us a thing that wasn't working. Then, he was like the digester at his house wasn't working as well. Then, I asked another beneficiary too, and they also told me that the digester wasn't working at their house as well. I asked another beneficiary, and I was told the same thing too (laughs)\[interrupted by a visitor\]"
55,2022-10-01,3, **Interviewer**: And you asked another beneficiary and you were told the same thing?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, then I kept on trying to the point that I realized that if I continued I would lose more money on buying cow manure than I had already lost. Then, I abandoned it, and it didn't even last for 4 months. But, I have to say I lost a lot of money on a thing that didn't work. From there I have received 3 groups of people to enquire about the digester. Then, last group came a year ago, and I told them openly that I had failed and the thing didn't help me at all. Then, they took pictures just like you have done and they went."
55,2022-10-01,4," **Interviewer**: So, did \[name redacted\] tell you that the digesters came from the government or from a non-governmental organization?"," **Interviewee**: Mm-hmm, let me say I didn't ask. So, I don\'t know whether it came from the government or NGO -- that I don't know!"
55,2022-10-01,5, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company came to install this?," **Interviewee**: It was a lot of people because they came in a car. I think here, they dropped 2 people to do the installation and the others proceeded to other sites to install the digesters."
55,2022-10-01,6," **Interviewer**: What did they do? And, what did you do?"," **Interviewee**: We were responsible for digging the hole. I hired 2 people to do the job, and I paid them K5000. On top of this I paid, K20000 for the bricks to line it with a brick wall around it."
55,2022-10-01,7," **Interviewer**: Oh, you lined it?"," **Interviewee**: We wanted to and we spent a lot of money on the whole thing. The figure may sound small now, but it was a lot of money then. And, if we had jotted everything down, you would have seen that it was a lot of money."
55,2022-10-01,8," **Interviewer**: Oh, I see. Did you buy cement to line it?"," **Interviewee**: No, I would have used mud as mortar."
55,2022-10-01,9, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to dug the hole and build it?," **Interviewee**: Because we wanted the digesters so bad, we did everything, as we were told and as fast as we could. I think it took some weeks, and everything from digging to commissioning took about a month."
55,2022-10-01,10," **Interviewer**: In this community, we have a lot of households and a lot of people too. How were you chosen as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: I can say it was God; when something comes unexpectedly and you are selected, you should only be thankful to God. I mean, I didn\'t know anything about it; I only became aware of it when they came to say they wanted to install it here, if I was interested. So, I was very excited about it."
55,2022-10-01,11," **Interviewer**: So, \[name redacted\] came to you just like I've come to you..."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, he only asked me if I was interested and willing to get it. So, when I saw that I could use it for cooking, I became so interested and I hired someone to help me because I couldn't have done the work on my own. My boy was skeptical about it, but they installers and other people said it was an easyway of cooking, so I was convinced and decided to take it. So, my boy when it didn't work was like I told you, and I have lost a lot of money for you to build it. Simply put, I was chosen by God to have it."
55,2022-10-01,12," **Interviewer**: You have said you couldn't have managed it on your own so you asked other people to help, why did you feel that way? Or, where did you see that you could not manage?"," **Interviewee**: It was because I had no bricks; I felt that I couldn't have managed to dig the hole too. Also, people were not giving me manure for free, so I had to buy to startit. On top of this, I had to buy manure everyday for regular feeding, and it was not practical. A bag of cow manure, if I'm not mistaken, was K150. So to buy 4 or 10 bags of manure, it was a lot of money."
55,2022-10-01,13, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't know anything about it. And, even today, I even have troubles in pronouncing the word ""biogas"" (laughs)"
55,2022-10-01,14, **Interviewer**: (laughs) really?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, so I just say a ""cooking device""."
55,2022-10-01,15," **Interviewer**: So \[name redacted\] and his friends came here to see if you would be interested in the digester and you accepted it. You had the right to deny it, why did you accept it to be built here?"," **Interviewee**: I accepted it because the stove was designed to stay inside the house, so I thought it was safe from thieves and also I could use it easy since it was within. It would have been a good thing if it had continued, because I like the intensity of its fire. It was taking little time to get water boiled."
55,2022-10-01,16, **Interviewer**: Do you think the digester came here without consulting the chiefs?, **Interviewee**: There was no way it could have come to the community without consulting the chiefs.
55,2022-10-01,17, **Interviewer**: So you think \[name redacted\] and the installers liaised with the chiefs before it came here., **Interviewee**: Yeah! Because I have never went to the chief or attended any community meeting regarding biogas.
55,2022-10-01,18, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?, **Interviewee**: I expected the digested to give my family some kind of peace and rest.
55,2022-10-01,19, **Interviewer**: What do you mean?," **Interviewee**: By simply going to the kitchen to cook and then serve food, that's peace! It was strange and surprising to see food being cooked without searching and using firewood. And, many people were coming to the kitchen to see how I was able to cook nsima without firewood. Many people desired it a lot, and many people wanted to have it as well. But, once I started complaining, all the people lost interest."
55,2022-10-01,20," **Interviewer**: Can you estimate, how many people came and were interested in owning the digester?"," **Interviewee**: It was a lot, my brother."
55,2022-10-01,21," **Interviewer**: Like 10, 50?"," **Interviewee**: Maybe 20 people and most of them were men who wanted to adopt the technology in their houses. Many strangers were coming too, and some of them were people we had never seen before. And, the installers advised me to call them whenever someone was interested in the digester. But, I didn't call them, because the digester wasn't helping me."
55,2022-10-01,22, **Interviewer**: What were you told to expect by the installers?," **Interviewee**: They told me that I would be able to warm water for bathing, cook nsima, and everything else that needs cooking. But, I was not able to do any of the things that they mentioned."
55,2022-10-01,23, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that you could use the digestate as fertilizer., **Interviewee**: Fertilizer? No!
55,2022-10-01,24, **Interviewer**: They were supposed to tell you that it produced slurry at the outlet that can be used as fertilizer. What about using it for lighting?," **Interviewee**: We asked about lighting and one of the people left us his number to make that arrangement with other people to bring solar panels. We have tried to communicate with him, but nothing has happened."
55,2022-10-01,25," **Interviewer**: But, you can also use the digester for lighting if you make certain arrangements."," **Interviewee**: Oooh, they didn't tell us that."
55,2022-10-01,26," **Interviewer**: Maybe if it had work properly, then they would have told you about that. What kind of training did you receive?"," **Interviewee**: Hmm, no."
55,2022-10-01,27," **Interviewer**: If you were not trained, then how were you able to switch it on and off?", **Interviewee**: They just showed us the button for switching it on and off.That was all I learnt.
55,2022-10-01,28, **Interviewer**: And maybe how to make feedstock?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they told us how to make feedstock and they also told us to make sure that there was no lumps and trash in the feedstock to prevent blockages."
55,2022-10-01,29, **Interviewer**: How prepared to run or operate the digester did you feel you were after they told you how to turn it on and maybe have to make feedstock?," **Interviewee**: I just feel like they made us work and spend our money for nothing. They made us handle cow manure without any benefit. I mean, when you're doing something you expect to gain something, but on this one we gained nothing after all the hard work... We spent money for nothing!"
55,2022-10-01,30, **Interviewer**: How did the people react when they saw that your digester was not working?," **Interviewee**: It's only a few people who are happy when somebody is blessed with something. Most people like to see people on the same level as them or below. People don't like to see people doing better than them. So when we failed people were happy and started demeaning us in their talk. People can talk when you fail my brother, my brother."
55,2022-10-01,31," **Interviewer**: Yeah, people talk. How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?", **Interviewee**: I was buying charcoal and sometimes I was cutting the bluegum trees around.
55,2022-10-01,32, **Interviewer**: You don't go to the mountains? You just use the trees around?," **Interviewee**: The mountain is protected, so it's hard to get firewood there. So, we just use bluegum trees around. That's why I say it was ablessing to get a digester."
55,2022-10-01,33, **Interviewer**: How much was a bag of charcoal then?," **Interviewee**: That time a bag of charcoal was cheap; a bag of charcoal was going at K1500 or K1000. Now seeing that there are no trees in the mountains they charge K5000. However, energy for cooking is not a problem around these months (after harvesting) because we use maize stalks and cobs. I only have that log of firewood there, because we had wedding ceremony and food preparation was done here, so it was left there. But, around this time, people only use maize cobs and stalks."
55,2022-10-01,34, **Interviewer**: How many bags of charcoal do you use in a month?," **Interviewee**: To be honestly with you, I rarely use charcoal because of the bluegum trees around."
55,2022-10-01,35," **Interviewer**: I can see that you have a lot of bluegum trees, how did you manage to get all these bluegum trees?", **Interviewee**: We got a lot of tree siblings from the agriculture extension office. I think it was a government program to encourage people to plant trees.
55,2022-10-01,36, **Interviewer**: You have said that time you had no cows....," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we used to buy there, and also from another place."
55,2022-10-01,37, **Interviewer**: That's not far. That's like 200 or 400 meters. What about the other place?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, this was close and a lot of people liked this place because it was cheap. The other place was far and when you went there, you couldn\'t find a person because people thought they were charging a lot more. Here they were charging K150, and the other place was charging K200."
55,2022-10-01,38, **Interviewer**: Why were people going after the manure?," **Interviewee**: There was also another beneficiary that side who used to come to buy manure too for their digester. And, the other people were coming to buy manure for fertilizer purposes."
55,2022-10-01,39, **Interviewer**: You mean the \[name redacted\] family?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they were also beneficiaries. That time a lot of people were approached but ended up denying it because they thought it was involving, and that they couldn't manage to source manure. So, beneficiaries were chosen from each village, and in this village, I was the only one who was chosen."
55,2022-10-01,40," **Interviewer**: You had no livestock, why do you think you were chosen?"," **Interviewee**: Honestly, I don't know why I was chosen."
55,2022-10-01,41," **Interviewer**: Okay, let's talk about how it worked. But before that, how much feedstock did you start it up with?"," **Interviewee**: We were told to charge it with 10 barrels of feedstock. That's we got 10 barrels of cow manure, add water and mix to have suitable slurry."
55,2022-10-01,42, **Interviewer**: So those 10 barrels was it just cow manure or cow manure with water.," **Interviewee**: We started feeding it with 2 barrels of pure water. And, that's when we started mixing 10barrels of cow manure with water to make suitable slurry."
55,2022-10-01,43, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add to the 10 barrels of water?," **Interviewee**: I can't really say because we weren't counting. But, it was a lot of water too because the bag was very huge."
55,2022-10-01,44, **Interviewer**: Where did you used to get water that time?," **Interviewee**: We have a borehole in this community. It's somewhere there, close to the chief's house (500 meters)."
55,2022-10-01,45, **Interviewer**: What type of barrels are you talking about?, **Interviewee**: I'm not talking about the plastic drums but the metallic ones.
55,2022-10-01,46, **Interviewer**: How many 20 liter buckets goes into that?, **Interviewee**: 6 buckets.
55,2022-10-01,47," **Interviewer**: So, that's like 120 liters per barrel. Oh, that must have been some work."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was a lot of work, and flies were over the place as we made feedstock."
55,2022-10-01,48, **Interviewer**: So they instructed you to make feedstock?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and it was the installers who started preparing the feedstock. They made feedstock out of one barrel, and then we hired workers to make feedstock from the remaining 9 barrels of cow manure."
55,2022-10-01,49, **Interviewer**: How many people did you hire to make the feedstock?, **Interviewee**: I hired two people.
55,2022-10-01,50, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay them?," **Interviewee**: I have forgotten how much exactly I paid them to make feedstock. But, all I can remember is that they were tough. They said they couldn't handle cow manure for little money (laughs). So, I paid a lot of money on that!"
55,2022-10-01,51, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up?, **Interviewee**: I believe it started producing fire after two weeks from the day we fed it with the first charge.
55,2022-10-01,52, **Interviewer**: Did they come to commission it?," **Interviewee**: Before commissioning, I have to say they were coming time and again. But, after commissioning, they stopped coming."
55,2022-10-01,53, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commission? Let's look at the first day.," **Interviewee**: Oh, it produced a very strong fire, and it was a joy to watch. And, at some point, it started producing little fire. The installers came and they saw that as well."
55,2022-10-01,54, **Interviewer**: How did they see that?," **Interviewee**: Four or five people came this other day to follow it up and I told them it was not taking long for the fire to die. Then, we went to the kitchen to see it. Afterwards, they asked me to put a pot of water and they turned it on. Then, the fire died before the water boiled. So, they went to the digester bag and started writing on a piece of paper. When they were going to the digester bag, I thought they would fix it, but I just saw them writing on a paper and then they left. I believe when I told them they didn't believe me, and that's why I asked to them to go to the kitchen to see it themselves. And when they turned it on, it produced strong flames for a very short time and died."
55,2022-10-01,55, **Interviewer**: Like how did it take?," **Interviewee**: you wouldn't walk from this place to that place, return, and find it on. No way, it wasn't producing fire that long."
55,2022-10-01,56," **Interviewer**: Oh, you couldn't walk for 200 meters back and forth.", **Interviewee**: Yeah
55,2022-10-01,57," **Interviewer**: After that, it was stopping completely?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
55,2022-10-01,58," **Interviewer**: On the first day, were you able to cook on it?"," **Interviewee**: On the first day, I was able to cook side dish of fish (10 -- 20 minutes). But, afterwards when I tried to cook porridge it didn't work (laughs)"
55,2022-10-01,59, **Interviewer**: (laughs) What about the second day?," **Interviewee**: After the fire dying, we had to wait for sometime for it to produce fire again. On the second day, when we tried to boil water, it went off."
55,2022-10-01,60, **Interviewer**: So you were able to use it only once when you cooked side dish of fish?," **Interviewee**: Not once. It was twice. And, I was also able to warm water for tea for a month. It was not a lot of water, it just 2 cups of tea (3 -- 5 minutes). It was working out because the flame that was coming out once it was started was very hot."
55,2022-10-01,61," **Interviewer**: So, if you were able to use the digester, it was for tea making basically?", **Interviewee**: It was only for tea. I never used it for cooking nsima.
55,2022-10-01,62, **Interviewer**: How many people were staying here what time?," **Interviewee**: Since it came here, I have always stayed alone. I'm mostly alone with that boy who comes in the evening only to sleep as he stays with his mom along the road."
55,2022-10-01,63," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were operation requirements?", **Interviewee**: They just told us that it needs manure.
55,2022-10-01,64, **Interviewer**: What type of manure?, **Interviewee**: Cow manure.
55,2022-10-01,65, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: First, I was getting a bucket with a wide opening. Then, I was placing manure in the bucket, add water, and then mix it. Afterwards, I was pouring the feedstock into the digester."
55,2022-10-01,66," **Interviewer**: How did you mix it? Did you use a stick, or a mixer or hands?"," **Interviewee**: They told us to break all the lumps in the feedstock, so we couldn't use a stick because it wasn't working. As a result, we used hands to make the feedstock -- I have to say I was involved in some unpleasant work."
55,2022-10-01,67, **Interviewer**: Didn't you feel gross doing that?," **Interviewee**: It was the installers who started that, so we just followed suit. I mean, if educated people who eat good food were doing that, who am I not to do? (Laughs)."
55,2022-10-01,68," **Interviewer**: How often were you supposed to feed it, and in what quantities?", **Interviewee**: They told us to feed it everyday with 2 bags (50kg) of cow manure.
55,2022-10-01,69, **Interviewer**: How much water?," **Interviewee**: The water was just for making suitable slurry. So we didn't have a standard, and we were counting the quantity of the water; apart from that water, we weren't adding any other water."
55,2022-10-01,70," **Interviewer**: Roughly, how much water were you adding to a 20-liter bucket of cow manure or to one bag?", **Interviewee**: I can't know. We were just adding water to have suitable feedstock.
55,2022-10-01,71, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it? Were you solely responsible?, **Interviewee**: I was solely responsible.
55,2022-10-01,72, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the task of feeding it?," **Interviewee**: It was hard because it was done every day. I mean, it couldn't produce fire, if it was not fed. Also, you need to feed it first before doing anything, because if you feed it later in the day, you couldn't give it time to produce gas. So, that also was a challenge. But, I feel like if it was working okay, we could have gotten used to all that and we wouldn't have complained too."
55,2022-10-01,73," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, how often should it be fed to be fair on the user?"," **Interviewee**: If they had said that it needs to be fed once or twice a week with 3 bags (50 liters) of cow manure, then it would have been fair. It was tall order to ask someone to feed it everyday."
55,2022-10-01,74, **Interviewer**: Did it meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: No, like I've said I was not able to cook nsima on it, I was only able to boil water for tea."
55,2022-10-01,75, **Interviewer**: Sure. What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: The only problem I had was that I lost money on it. And, the sad part is that the money I lost wasn't mine. I asked the money from my child and I wasted it for nothing."
55,2022-10-01,76," **Interviewer**: Yeah, it's different from wasting your own money"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and I was shouted for that. My son was like I'm nave and credulous (laughs). Then, I was like I'm not credulous; it's just that I wanted to make cooking easy."
55,2022-10-01,77, **Interviewer**: How long did it work before it stopped working?," **Interviewee**: I can say it worked for 2 months. During the first month, I tried everything to make it work, but it didn't. Then, I gave up in the following month. And, when the installers came, they commented that I was better off than the rest. They said no one was using it for any other purpose. So, I thought to myself that if the other beneficiaries were not able to make it work, was I going to make it work? So, I knew it was just a matter of time before it failed."
55,2022-10-01,78, **Interviewer**: How many times have you received people to talk about the digester?, **Interviewee**: I have received people a couple of times; I think 4 times.
55,2022-10-01,79, **Interviewer**: When they came what were they saying?," **Interviewee**: They were asking me questions just like you're doing, and they saw that things wouldn't work."
55,2022-10-01,80, **Interviewer**: What kind of questions did you receive?," **Interviewee**: For example, they asked me how I felt since it didn't work, and I was like I feel bad because I wasted a lot of money on it for nothing."
55,2022-10-01,81, **Interviewer**: What did they say they would do afterwards?, **Interviewee**: I remember one time they told me they were sorry and gave me K500 (laughs)
55,2022-10-01,82, **Interviewer**: Oh (laughs heavily)," **Interviewee**: (laughs) yeah, and that day I appreciated it a lot because I had no salt so I used the money to buy salt."
55,2022-10-01,83, **Interviewer**: So you said you used it for a month. We you buying manure all that time?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I was buying manure at K150. And I bought the manure for about 30 days."
55,2022-10-01,84, **Interviewer**: What was the problem with your digester? Did you see any technical problem with it?," **Interviewee**: No, it was just producing very little gas for a very short time."
55,2022-10-01,85, **Interviewer**: Did you try to fix it?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't."
55,2022-10-01,86, **Interviewer**: Did you call the project implementers?," **Interviewee**: To be honest with you, I never called them, because that time, I thought the installers would be coming to monitor everything that was happening."
55,2022-10-01,87," **Interviewer**: Okay, have you seen something like this?", **Interviewee**: No
55,2022-10-01,88, **Interviewer**: What do you think of this information and do you think itwould have helped you?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it would have helped.... I think the installers were getting reports that the digesters were not working because other beneficially and I used to go to Mr. Msothi to complain that project had made us lost money. We also questioned the purpose of the coming of digesters since we wondered if the digesters work.Then, he was like he too had lost some money. So, I believe every beneficiary lost money because of the project in one way or the other."
55,2022-10-01,89, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of your digester?," **Interviewee**: The digester is not currently working and some of the equipment is lost, for example, the white pipes. As for the bag, it is buried in the ground, and if we could dig the site today, we would find it."
55,2022-10-01,90, **Interviewer**: And I can see you are using the green pipe as a clothesline. I think it could have been better if they had simply donated clotheslines (laughs)., **Interviewee**: (laughs) funny!
55,2022-10-01,91," **Interviewer**: How did it reach this stage? And, in your opinion, what was the cause?"," **Interviewee**: I should be asking you how it reached that stage, because I feel like you have failed as a project implementer and have squandered our money. You gave us things that don't work and in the process, we have lost money on things that didn't benefit us at all. So, the question is, what are you going to do after what happened to us? Because, I believe you are responsible and accountable for its failure."
55,2022-10-01,92," **Interviewer**: Oh, they gave you things that don't work?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, those things don't work."
55,2022-10-01,93, **Interviewer**: Why do you think a whole organization would come and give you things that do not work?," **Interviewee**: The question I asked myself is that when you brought the digesters here, did you see that they worked somewhere else? And if it worked there, why did it not work here? And I'm pretty sure that what we did, the other people also did the same because we basically did what we were told. So my question is when you brought these things here, were you sure that these things work? You have asked me questions and it's my time to ask you questions -- Do these things work? You made us lost a lot of money because of the digesters."
55,2022-10-01,94," **Interviewer**: It's only fair that I should answer a question too. We are not the ones who installed these things. But, I've gone to many places in Machinga, Nsanje, and Mangochi to check out what's happening with the digesters. And, I can tell you today that what you are saying is basically what every beneficiary says. The things didn't work everywhere, so we will try to see why they failed, and we will answer that question -- ""Do these things work?"""," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they give us a thing that deprived us of salt and other basic necessities. I mean, when we had K300 we couldn't buy anything else but cow manure. And, after spending all that, we couldn't get anything out. It's sad! And if you can look close, you will see that all the work that was involved required hired labour. So, we lost a lot of money. And when the installers came, they were just moving around the digester, pinching it and then saying it's full without doing something tangible to solve the problem."
55,2022-10-01,95," **Interviewer**: (laughs,) You have told me that now when you want to cook you use firewood, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah
55,2022-10-01,96," **Interviewer**: You said that time we didn't have livestock, but now you have. How do you manage your cow manure now?"," **Interviewee**: I use the manure as fertilizer. Now, I haven't got the manure out of the cow house. But, I will start gathering it tomorrow."
55,2022-10-01,97, **Interviewer**: Do you heap it on the ground or do you dig a pit?," **Interviewee**: I do have a pit but it's full now because I've been putting manure in the pit for two years now. If I had money, I would have gotten it out and taken it to the farm."
55,2022-10-01,98," **Interviewer**: Do you just gather manure in the pit? Or, you add something else?"," **Interviewee**: I simply put manure. Then, after a year or so, I hire people to carry the manure to the farm and use it as fertilizer. I can't manage to carry it on my own, because at that point, it's more like soil and it's heavy."
55,2022-10-01,99, **Interviewer**: How does the manure work?, **Interviewee**: It produces maize of big kernels.
55,2022-10-01,100," **Interviewer**: Okay, we are going towards the much did the reactor cost?"," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't tell us."
55,2022-10-01,101, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: I only contributed in the work that I was hiring people to do on my behalf.
55,2022-10-01,102, **Interviewer**: How many people lined the hole?," **Interviewee**: Our digester was not lined. They just dug the hole and placed the digester. Of course, they told us to line it, but it stopped working while we were about to start lining it. But, the other beneficiary lined it."
55,2022-10-01,103, **Interviewer**: So you didn't line it?," **Interviewee**: We didn't line it, but it was in our plans and budget."
55,2022-10-01,104, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't tell us anything about that."
55,2022-10-01,105," **Interviewer**: I want to ask you if the digest the helped you to save money, but from what I've gathered you only lost quite a lot of money because of it...Roughly, how much money did you lose?"," **Interviewee**: I bought burned bricks at K15000. Then, they told us that it was not enough, so we bought extra bricks for K5000. I paid the boys who dug the hole K5000. I also paid them another K500 for carrying. Then, I was buying the manure at K150. So, you can see I was buying manure at K150, but the people were charging me K500 to collect and transport the manure.You can imagine, I was told to gather 10 or 15 bags of fresh cow manure to make the first charge, and I paid the people who carried feedstock too. So, that was a lot of manure, and this whole place was covered with bags of cow manure that day."
55,2022-10-01,106," **Interviewer**: Yeah, you really spent a lot of money. What is your opinion of biogas now?"," **Interviewee**: I don't have positive thoughts on biogas because it didn't help me and I didn't use it. And, the people I requested money from to help start it up can't give me the money again, if I ask them to."
55,2022-10-01,107, **Interviewer**: So if someone wants to give you the same again it can't work because the people who supported you to start it up can't support you again because they felt it was a waste of money., **Interviewee**: There is no way they can support me on biogas. No way!
55,2022-10-01,108, **Interviewer**: What is the future of biogas in Malawi?," **Interviewee**: It's hard for me to say that I see it continuing after the experience I had with it, which I saw nothing good about it. I can only see a future if it can be designed in a different way that peoplecan use."
55,2022-10-01,109," **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own energy or waste intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: It's easy to think about one, but to have the resources to implement it is another thing."
55,2022-10-01,110," **Interviewer**: So which alternatives can you think of? I mean, on that one you didn't spend money from your pocket, but others assisted you. So, in the same way, what if the same people want to support you with or on a different solution. Which solution would you think of?"," **Interviewee**: Then, it could be any solution that would make cooking easy."
55,2022-10-01,111, **Interviewer**: Like what?, **Interviewee**: I can't think of any other thing. I think you are better placed to know the other solution.
55,2022-10-01,112," **Interviewer**: Okay, in closing do you have any last words?"," **Interviewee**: If it's possible, bring a solution that can help me, not biogas because it didn't help me in any way."
55,2022-10-01,113," **Interviewer**: If you could meet the installers today, what would you say to them?"," **Interviewee**: I didn't hold any words on them and that's why they gave K500 (laughs). And, they were like we have gone to all the beneficiaries, but it seems you are the one that is most stressed about losing money because of biogas."
55,2022-10-01,114, **Interviewer**: What did you say to them to the point that they had to give you money?," **Interviewee**: I asked them that when you are bring products to help community people, do you bring things that work or not. And, I questioned them if they tried the digesters somewhere? And if yes, did the digester worked or not? And, if they worked, did the digesters help the people? I told them that if they had tried or had experience with the digesters somewhere, then they wouldn't have brought them here. And, I told them that they just saw the digesters somewhere without knowing what they are, and brought them here that was totally injustice on us. You made us handle cow manure and all that. That's when one of the woman laughed and gave me K500 (laughs). Then, she commented that I had every right to complain, because the whole work was a totally failure. So, she said because they have failed, she could only say sorry, and that's why she gave me K500."
55,2022-10-01,115, **Interviewer**: Oh (laughs) interesting. Thanks for the interview. I have leave and see the other beneficiary too. Thanks for the interview again.,NA
56,2022-11-13,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: It came with Ecogen. What happened was that Ecogen came to our cow farmers group and briefed us about the digesters. That time, I wasn't at the meeting but my wife was there. So, when she heard about the digester, she became interested and asked me to get one. So, we got one, and here in \[location redacted\], we are the only ones who have this. It could have been disappointing for them to come here and not get even one single customer. So, after that, they came and they advise us to dig holes for the digester."
56,2022-11-13,2, **Interviewer**: How much did the digester cost?," **Interviewee**: The cost of the digester is K850000, and the money is supposed to be paid within 2 years."
56,2022-11-13,3, **Interviewer**: Who built it?," **Interviewee**: To construct a digester you need 2 holes, and I'm the one who dug the holes. As for other work, for instance, its installation, Ecogen did that."
56,2022-11-13,4, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company were involved in its installation?," **Interviewee**: There were three people, female and 2 males."
56,2022-11-13,5, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to dig the hole?," **Interviewee**: I started digging the hole at 4:00 PM after knocking of from work, and then I continued the following day to finish at 11 AM."
56,2022-11-13,6," **Interviewer**: Oh, that was some work"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was a lot of work."
56,2022-11-13,7," **Interviewer**: Apart from digging, what was your other role? And, who was responsible for making the first feedstock?"," **Interviewee**: On the first day, they showed us how to do it, so they were responsible for making the feedstock. But, after that, I was responsible for making the feedstock and feeding it."
56,2022-11-13,8, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I knew everything about biogas because of them."
56,2022-11-13,9," **Interviewer**: I believe your cattle group has a lot of members, so could you take me through the meeting you had with Ecogen? What did they say? And, why didn't the other cow owners get the digesters?"," **Interviewee**: On that day, there was a meeting of cow farmers, so they took advantage of that and they came to discuss about their digesters. And, they also came with a biogas storage bag to demonstrate their product. So, at the end of their demonstration people ate nsima with side dish. And, on that particular day, they were over 50 people. After their presentation, the people become interested in the digesters, but people were put off by the price of K800000. So, nearly all cow farmers thought the price was too much and it didn't get the digesters. I think my wife only accepted it because she knew that I'm a cow farmer, and I'm also employed. So, I accepted her request because I thought it was going to her help. Now, I think we made a mistake. But, since we already got it, and we can't return it, we will do anything to make it work -- and the only consolation now is that we get our cow manure from it -- and we make compost from it."
56,2022-11-13,10, **Interviewer**: So a lot of people liked it but they were put off by itself price?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, when we started using it a lot of people came and they liked it. I remember four people asked me to give them the number of the installers so that they could also be installed one. But, when they called the installers they were told that they needed to pay a deposit of K200000 and also that the price of the digesters had risen to K900000 or K950000. So, they told them that they could not manage, and that's why they did not get it. Now, I understand that the price of it is over K1 million, and that's not something that a farmer can manage."
56,2022-11-13,11," **Interviewer**: My understanding is that you expected to use it for cooking and as well as a source of fertilizer. Apart from this, is there anything else you expected from it?"," **Interviewee**: My biggest expectation as a farmer and as a villager was that my wife was going to use it for 3 hours cooking, and that's a lot of cooking time. So with that I anticipated that my wife would be using it in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening for cooking. But, now that's not the case. Now, it's not possible for her to cook nsima and side dish (1 hour -- 1 hour and 30 minutes of cook time). The other thing was that I expected it to provide us with fertilizer, and that's what attracted me most about it, because we live in a village and we can't do anything else apart from farming. From this, I also expected to supply other community members with his fertilizer at a certain price. So, those were my expectations!"
56,2022-11-13,12, **Interviewer**: You are saying you expected to get three hours of cooking time but that's not the case. How much cooking time are you getting from it now?," **Interviewee**: I'm only getting 30 minutes, and after that, it goes off. And to get that you also need to put a bag of sand or stones on top of the digester bag to force the gas out of the bag."
56,2022-11-13,13," **Interviewer**: Oh, sad. How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?"," **Interviewee**: She was using firewood and charcoal. And now it's not like things have changed, I still use firewood and charcoal because we are getting very limited cooking time."
56,2022-11-13,14, **Interviewer**: Where do you get firewood?," **Interviewee**: We have trees but they are not enough to get firewood from everyday. So, we buy firewood from wood vendors of Mulanje, who usually sell firewood in Blantyre."
56,2022-11-13,15," **Interviewer**: In a month, how much firewood and charcoal do you buy?"," **Interviewee**: I use one bag of 50 kg of charcoal, and firewood of K10000."
56,2022-11-13,16, **Interviewer**: How much is a bag of charcoal in Mikolongwe?," **Interviewee**: Charcoal price depends on the season; charcoal is more expensive in wet season than in dry season because it's hard to produce it in cold season, and also because the demand is high as people use it for warming water. So, we buy a bag of charcoal at K10000, and if you are a good negotiator, you get it at K8000 from the same vendor."
56,2022-11-13,17," **Interviewer**: From your statements, I believe you have cows. How many cows did you have that time? And, how many do you have now?"," **Interviewee**: The time they came, I had two cows. And now I still have two cows. I had 4 cows lately, but I have sold one because I wanted to sort out some issues, and the other one died."
56,2022-11-13,18, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your manure before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: I have a hole of 3m long, 3m wide and 1m deep. So, I put the manure there. Now, I add effluent on the manure to make strong fertilizer. Then, after everything, we cover the manure with plastic bag for 6 weeks."
56,2022-11-13,19," **Interviewer**: People say if you want fertilizer go to a shop and get inorganic fertilizer, because manure doesn't work as fertilizer, what's your take?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, inorganic fertilizer is better. But, I do see change when I use the compost too. And this other time I tried effluent from the digester on my vegetable garden, and it worked quite okay. The beans, mustard, and other vegetables did well, and the other thing is that when you use the effluent you don't need to apply pesticide. Thus, after we applied the effluent no weevils, armyworms and other pests came near the garden, so it's good in that regard. And this time around, I\'m planning to collect the effluent and dilute it because it's too strong you can't use it as come, and then apply it on a separate maize field when I normally harvest two bags of maize to try it out on maize."
56,2022-11-13,20, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you start it with?," **Interviewee**: Initially, because the bag is big they told us to pour 10 drums (200 liters) of pure water. Then, I gathered 5 or 6 bags of fresh manure and started feeding it with slurry of 2 or 3 buckets (20 kg) of fresh cow manure and 4 or 6 buckets of water every day for 10 days. In the morning, I was feeding it one bucket of cow manure. In the afternoon hours, I was also adding one bucket. During the 10 days, I did not miss a day to feed it because it was new and I wanted to do everything right. So, after 10 days, I was told to wait for 5 days, and after 5 days, they came and started it."
56,2022-11-13,21, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the manure?," **Interviewee**: Before coming, they gave me enough time to gather manure. So, I was collecting fresh cow manure, and then keeping it in the bags. And after that, I managed to get six or five bags of cow manure, which I used for starting it up."
56,2022-11-13,22, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: We have a borehole nearby so I hired people to draw water for us.
56,2022-11-13,23, **Interviewer**: Like how far from your house?, **Interviewee**: It's 150 meters.
56,2022-11-13,24, **Interviewer**: Okay. How did it work after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: The digester started well because we did cook nsima on that day, and the nsima was hot and very tasty -- and it was fast. And, biogas in general is it faster than cooking on charcoal or firewood. It's very good in that regard. And after commissioning, they told us that there was less gas because we had just started, but as we progress, gas production would increase up to 3 hours of cooking hour. So, I dedicated to myself to feeding it and every day before going to work, I was feeding it and after returning, I was also feeding it. And, when I was going away, I was ordering my wife and children to collect fresh cow manure and put it in a bag, so that we would not fail to feed it once. But, now we are getting a little bit lazy because when we put nsima on the stove, it goes off as the nsima is simmering."
56,2022-11-13,25, **Interviewer**: Have you reported this to Ecogen and what's their response?," **Interviewee**: When we report to them, they say that we are not feeding it enough.... But, on the day they installed it, they applauded me for me efforts saying they have never seen a committed person like me as I was doing everything by myself without help from anybody. My plan was to do everything by myself and I still feed it myself because I don't want the kids or a hired worker to mess it up by feeding it with feedstock containing rubbish. So, personally, I don't agree with the fact that I don't feed it -- I feed it by myself and I know I feed enough. So, right now think it's not producing gas because thick slurry has settled on the base of the bag. Thus, if the slurry was coming out by an extra outlet, I believe it would work."
56,2022-11-13,26, **Interviewer**: What usually happens is that the slurry is taken out of the system at the outlet as digestate. Does your bag release digestate?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it does and I have a hole at the outlet that collects it. And, sometimes, when it's stuck on the outlet pipe, I take the digestate that's blocking it, and effluent starts coming out too."
56,2022-11-13,27, **Interviewer**: How many people do use the gas?, **Interviewee**: We are five.
56,2022-11-13,28, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: First, they advised me to feed the digester on a daily basis, and that the feedstock should not contain any plastics or stones. And, that's why I feed it myself because I don't want any shortcuts in feeding, so that's why I don't allow my children or anyone else to feed it.And, since I started not even my wife has fed it. I do everything in an organized manner and according to the installers' instructions in terms of preparation of feedstock. And, other thing is that the digester bag needs to be placed where it should be exposed to the sun. So, we did that when we were installing it, and now I do everything as I was taught."
56,2022-11-13,29, **Interviewer**: How do you prepare feedstock?," **Interviewee**: Every morning, I go to the cow house to collect one bucket of fresh cow manure in a bucket. Then, I add two buckets of water and then mix the feedstock thoroughly. As I'm mixing the feedstock, I try as much as possible to remove grass and small stones or sand, which is found in a cow house. After seeing that the slurry is thoroughly mixed, I open the inlet pipe, feed it, and then clean the buckets."
56,2022-11-13,30, **Interviewer**: Do you have a mixer? How do you mix it?," **Interviewee**: Honestly speaking, I have gloves from my work, but I use bare hands in mixing the feedstock in a bucket."
56,2022-11-13,31, **Interviewer**: Why do you use bare hands?," **Interviewee**: It is because when they installers came they didn't advise me to use gloves, and even themselves didn't use gloves the first time they prepared feedstock. Moreover, cow manure can be handled because we see that it eat grass and maize grain, so it doesn't feel gross to handle it."
56,2022-11-13,32, **Interviewer**: How often do you feed your digester?, **Interviewee**: I feed it once or twice daily in a ratio of 1:2. But now I'm becoming a bit lazy because of its performance.
56,2022-11-13,33, **Interviewer**: How did you manage to gather five bags of cows and even feed it every day with at least a bucket of fresh manure with only 2 cows? Is feedstock not a challenge to you?," **Interviewee**: During the day, I advised my wife to collect fresh cow manure every time a cow poops, so by the end of the day we collect 75% of a bucket \[15Kgs\]. And, you should know that cow poops little in the daylight unlike in the night. So, in the morning, I collect one bucket and a half-bucket (30kgs) of cow manure. Of course, sometimes these days I don't collect in the morning, so I take the dry manure to my pit for composting. So, the secret of having enough manure from cows is feeding. If you feed your cows frequently and enough, you get a lot of manure."
56,2022-11-13,34, **Interviewer**: So you feed your cows adequately and frequently?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I have a worker who feeds it. And, every time I'm coming from the office, I also get cow feed. Plus, also ask my son to gather feed for the cows too."
56,2022-11-13,35," **Interviewer**: Okay, what are the maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: One time the gas valve, close to stove got damaged as my child was trying to use it. After that, I took some pictures, and then went to Limbe Market \[The biggest market in Blantyre\] to buy it, but I didn't find it. Then, I reported and sent the installers the picture, and they came to fix it, but didn't charge me anything."
56,2022-11-13,36, **Interviewer**: Oh nice. Did they give you a service warranty?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's for 2 years."
56,2022-11-13,37, **Interviewer**: Great! You are saying it doesn't meet your needs. Tell me about that one.," **Interviewee**: It's not meeting my needs. My wife is here with me and she can agree with me on that. \[Hands over the phone to her\].... Yeah, it's not meeting our needs. But, when we feed it, we do manage to prepare breakfast (10 -- 20 minutes) and then cook light side dish that doesn't need a lot of heat, for example, vegetables, eggs and fish (10 -- 20), and sometimes we do manage to cook nsima in the afternoon --but this is very, very rare."
56,2022-11-13,38," **Interviewer**: Okay, that's very nice. What challenges have you been facing since it was installed?", **Interviewee**: I'm not facing any challenges.
56,2022-11-13,39, **Interviewer**: So it's only that you're not getting enough cooking time?, **Interviewee**: Right! That's the only issue.
56,2022-11-13,40, **Interviewer**: You are telling me that it had an issue with the gas valve. How long did it take the gas valve to get broken?, **Interviewee**: It took some time -- it took some months.
56,2022-11-13,41," **Interviewer**: Maybe 4, 2 or 9 months?", **Interviewee**: It was exactly 6 months.
56,2022-11-13,42," **Interviewer**: When you reported the issue, how long did it take them to come?"," **Interviewee**: The installers stay in Lilongwe, so when I reported the issue they told me that they would send someone to come, and if they fail to find someone they were going to come themselves. Then after three days, they called me that someone was coming from Poly to fix it, so that's how it was fixed."
56,2022-11-13,43, **Interviewer**: How did you know that the gas valve was broken?, **Interviewee**: Gas was leaking on that part.
56,2022-11-13,44," **Interviewer**: So before that, you went to Limbe to find a spare part by yourself, but you were not successful in your attempt...."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I took the part out to Limbe as a sample. And, I visited all the hardware shops in Limbe, and it didn't find it."
56,2022-11-13,45," **Interviewer**: We are remaining with about five questions. Were you given written information like on a piece of paper regarding common issues associated with digesters, their causes and possible solution?", **Interviewee**: Something like a manual?
56,2022-11-13,46," **Interviewer**: Yeah, kind of."," **Interviewee**: No, I wasn't given."
56,2022-11-13,47, **Interviewer**: What do you think about that kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's useful information, and whenever I do have a problem, I would be using it to diagnose a problem and solve it."
56,2022-11-13,48, **Interviewer**: How do you meet your energy needs now? You are still using firewood and charcoal like you said in the beginning?," **Interviewee**: We usually start off by using biogas, and whenever it goes off work, we continue with firewood and charcoal."
56,2022-11-13,49," **Interviewer**: And you are still using manure as a fertilizer, right?", **Interviewee**: Yeah.
56,2022-11-13,50, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I will discuss with the installers to improve its cooking time, so that I can be using it for 3 hours, if not, at least 2 hours; 20 or 30 minutes is not enough. But, I will continue feeding it because I'm getting fertilizer from it."
56,2022-11-13,51, **Interviewer**: Did you line or plaster the hole?," **Interviewee**: Three days after it was installed, we had rains. So, the water in the hole lifted up the bag. Then, I borrow a water pump, and then removed all the water from the hole. After that, I removed the digester bag and plastered the hole, and placed it back. I did this work alone, and when the installers came, they commended me for the job."
56,2022-11-13,52," **Interviewer**: Impressive. Last question, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what would you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: \[Wait a bit I want to attend to visitors\]....When they came they told me that it's also possible for a digester to produce light, but it needs the pipe to be leveled and straight so it can accommodate one bulb only. And, I would have also appreciated if they had made it possible for us to charge phones at least. That way I can be generating money from people who coming to charge their phones. Then, I can be buying small things like salt for the family."
56,2022-11-13,53, **Interviewer**: That was my last question; do you have anything to say before winding up?," **Interviewee**: My last words are, biogas is very helpful because it has two or three things that can help a person at a household level; first, biogas makes my cow house clean because everyday I'm forced to collect manure from the cow house and use it as feedstock for the digester. Without this, my cow house was staying for a week or even months without cleaning. As a result, my cows were sleeping in unclean place. The other thing is that biogas assists me in making compost, which I use as fertilizer. So, I'm expecting to improve the soil structure and composition of my fields. The last thing is that with the effluent, pests will not trouble me. I noticed the last time I tried it up, that once I applied the effluent as fertilizer, there was no pest manifestation. So, this will make it possible for me to grow maize and vegetables without inorganic fertilizer and pesticides. Last but not least, the fire we get from biogas is clean and doesn't dirt pots, unlike when one cooks on firewood. So, it helps us save money because it reduces the buying of soap used for cleaning the pots -- So it helps a lot and you can't see and understand these things unless you have a digester. And, if you can understand it more, you can see that it has more benefits, so we will find out more in regards to its benefits as we continue using it. Also, it helps save money because it minimizes the usage offirewood. For a person like me at one point, I was using K2000 of firewood instead of K10000. And, in wet season, I was only buying the K200 or K300 packs of charcoal, because it doesn't work efficiently in wet season. So, if it starts working well, I hope to start buying a K2000 bag of charcoal a month."
56,2022-11-13,54," **Interviewer**: One more thing, you are saying that your digester is not working well, what do you think it's the problem? Are you not feeding it enough? Doesn't it have power to work for long? Or, it wasn't installed properly?"," **Interviewee**: When we were starting it off, we did put together 20 kg of inoculum of bacteria to help boost its efficiency. So, after the hole was filled with water, I pumped out some of the feedstock or manure from the bag to take the back out, so that I could plaster the hole. Afterwards, I returned some of the feedstock. I failed to return all the feedstock because I didn't have enough drum, so I just dumped some of it in the field. So, sometimes I think it did affect the whole setup in the bag."
56,2022-11-13,55, **Interviewer**: How many drums did you manage to put back?, **Interviewee**: I think it was 5 or 6.
56,2022-11-13,56, **Interviewer**: Did you notify Ecogen?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I told them when they came."
56,2022-11-13,57," **Interviewer**: And, what did they say?"," **Interviewee**: They commended me for the job I did, so I presume that they thought it wasn't a problem."
56,2022-11-13,58," **Interviewer**: But, you think it\`s a problem.", **Interviewee**: Of course.
56,2022-11-13,59, **Interviewer**: Do you doubt their expertise?, **Interviewee**: (laughs) no.
56,2022-11-13,60," **Interviewer**: Okay, thanks for the interview.",NA
57,2022-11-16,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: It came here with Ecogen, and when they came at SHMPA, they taught us about its requirements and management. In addition, after the meeting we had with them we learned that it supplies fertilizer as well as energy for cooking thereby saving the environment, as it does not involve firewood. So, after the meeting session, I became interested in biogas, and I also thought I could manage it."
57,2022-11-16,2, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the funds to get a biogas?," **Interviewee**: I used to my own money. I bought the digester at K650000, but they gave me an open installment payment period of 2 year. So it's not like we pay every month or after every 3 or 6 months, we just agreed that it 2 years we should settle the payment."
57,2022-11-16,3," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's good."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it's really good. Right now, I'm able to get fertilizer from it and also I'm able to cook my things easily."
57,2022-11-16,4, **Interviewer**: Who built it?," **Interviewee**: It was build by Ecogen. I remember it was \[name redacted\] and his team that came, and my people supported them too. For example, the holes were dug by my people. In terms of the equipment and everything, for example, the buckets came from Ecogen."
57,2022-11-16,5," **Interviewer**: How many people came from the installation company? And, how many people were from your side?"," **Interviewee**: My people were 2, and they also came 2. But, if we include their driver I can say 3."
57,2022-11-16,6, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to build?," **Interviewee**: It didn't take long to build. My people took two days to dig the hole, and the installers also took some hours to assemble everything. So, if we include the time it took to make feedstock, I can say it took 3 days to do everything."
57,2022-11-16,7, **Interviewer**: Where did you source the manure?, **Interviewee**: I got it from my cow house.
57,2022-11-16,8, **Interviewer**: How many did you have?, **Interviewee**: I have 6 cows.
57,2022-11-16,9, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?, **Interviewee**: I didn't know anything about biogas before Ecogen came. I was enlightened about biogas at the meeting session we had with them.
57,2022-11-16,10, **Interviewer**: What was the meeting session like?," **Interviewee**: Ecogen came for a one-day meeting session and 60 cow farmers attended the meeting. So, at first they briefed us about Ecogen and biogas. Then, they asked us what are our sources of energy, how much firewood or charcoal do we use in a month, and they also asked us how much fertilizer we use on our crops. Then, they went on to say that with biogas we could stop usingfirewood and eventually save money and the environment. Then, they said that with biogas we would also stop buying inorganic fertilizer. So, when I heard all this I became very interested and that's why I got one."
57,2022-11-16,11," **Interviewer**: You have said that they asked you to provide information regarding money you spend on charcoal and firewood. I believe they asked that to know how much you were spending as an individual or collective on firewood and charcoal. How much were you spending in a month? Or, how much was the group spending in a month after their computation?"," **Interviewee**: It was a lot of money -- it was a lot. I have just forgotten where I wrote the figure. Nevertheless, you can imagine how much firewood and charcoal we use in a day, and equate that to a month or year, and then express that in monetary terms-- so, it was a lot of money."
57,2022-11-16,12, **Interviewer**: How much fertilizer do you use per growing season?," **Interviewee**: I use four bags of fertilizer, and you can see now that a bag of fertilizer is K59000, so that is a lot of money too. So you can see that biogas is good. I remember last time I tried it on a small piece of land, and it worked. So this time around, I am going to use a lot of it... I got the digester last year October, so I had time to try it on vegetables, tomatoes, and it worked quite okay."
57,2022-11-16,13," **Interviewer**: This meeting session you had with Ecogen, who attended it? Was it for cow farmers only or some community members were there as well?", **Interviewee**: It was just for 60 cow farmers.
57,2022-11-16,14," **Interviewer**: So at the end of the program, how many were willing to get the digesters?"," **Interviewee**: 15 cow farmers showed interest, but at the end, only three of us got the digesters."
57,2022-11-16,15, **Interviewer**: Why do you think the other people did not get it?," **Interviewee**: It is not as if the other people did not like it, no. They liked it but people thought the money was too much, so they just thought they could not afford it. People thought K650000 was way out of their budget. Nevertheless, now some people are interested to get the digesters after seeing how good we are doing. I remember in a phone call with the installers, they told me that many people from our group are showing interest in the digesters, so they are thinking of coming again."
57,2022-11-16,16," **Interviewer**: Oh nice. From my understanding, I believe you expected to use the digester for cooking and as a source of fertilizer too. Apart from this, what else did you expect?"," **Interviewee**: When they came, we asked them if we could use the digesters for lighting. So, they responded that at that time it was not possible, but in the future.So at the moment we are only using the digesters for cooking and as a source of fertilizer."
57,2022-11-16,17, **Interviewer**: Why did they say it was not possible to have lighting at that time?," **Interviewee**: They said that they needed some equipment to put together to make it produce light. Nevertheless, I have to say I did not fully grasp what they were saying. I think they also said it takes time for the digester to produce enough gas to use for cooking as well as lighting at the same time."
57,2022-11-16,18, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: No, after the discussions we had at the meeting with Ecogen, we didn't have any training afterwards."
57,2022-11-16,19," **Interviewer**: At the meeting with Ecogen, you have said they briefed you about biogas. What else did you learn at the meeting?"," **Interviewee**: Of course, they briefed us about biogas. After that, they demonstrated to us how it works. I recall they made a cooking demonstration. They did cook nsima, side dish, and we ate the food."
57,2022-11-16,20, **Interviewer**: Did they use a storage bag?," **Interviewee**: They brought a gas storage bag, they taught us about biogas, and then we cooked nsima and side dish on a two burner stove."
57,2022-11-16,21," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's nice!"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was nice. And, we were very interested in the whole thing, and we could not believe how fast it was, and that we cooked two things at the same time."
57,2022-11-16,22, **Interviewer**: How prepared to run or operate the reactor did you feel you were after that meeting and other meetings that followed?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, after that, another man called \[name redacted\] came and he told us what to do when there was little gas. He told us to step on or press the digester, so that we could have strong fire. Then, he told us how to use it, and he finished by saying that if we have any problem we should be calling them to fix it."
57,2022-11-16,23, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the intervention?, **Interviewee**: I was using firewood and sometimes I was using charcoal.
57,2022-11-16,24, **Interviewer**: Where did you get wood?," **Interviewee**: That time we were just cutting or pruning the trees. And, when we had nothing to prune, we used to buy firewood. So, that's how it was that time."
57,2022-11-16,25," **Interviewer**: Do you have the trees, or do you gather firewood in the forests?"," **Interviewee**: We have bluegum trees around as you can see. We also have mango trees. So, we use those for firewood too."
57,2022-11-16,26, **Interviewer**: And some times you used charcoal?, **Interviewee**: Yeah.
57,2022-11-16,27, **Interviewer**: How many bags of charcoal did you use?, **Interviewee**: Maybe 1 and 1.5 bags a month.
57,2022-11-16,28, **Interviewer**: How much was a bag of charcoal then?, **Interviewee**: It was K8000 or K9000.
57,2022-11-16,29, **Interviewer**: You are saying you had six cows. How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: I was simply taking the manure out of the cow house, and then gather it in a pit before taking it to the fields."
57,2022-11-16,30," **Interviewer**: Some people say animal manure does not work as fertilizer, what is your take?", **Interviewee**: That's a lie. You cannot compare maize applied with animal manure as fertilizer with maize that was not applied anything. It differs.
57,2022-11-16,31, **Interviewer**: How do you make your manure to be effective?," **Interviewee**: I just sometime put it in a pit and wait for some time to process. Sometimes, I simply heap it and then wait for some time for it to process and afterwards take it to the field."
57,2022-11-16,32, **Interviewer**: Do you add ash?," **Interviewee**: I shouldn't lie, I don't put anything else. I just use the manure as it is."
57,2022-11-16,33, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you use to start it up?, **Interviewee**: We started it with three drums of cow manure.
57,2022-11-16,34, **Interviewer**: How big are your drums?, **Interviewee**: The popular ones -- I think they are 200 liters.
57,2022-11-16,35," **Interviewer**: Yeah, you are right. I think its 200 liters. How much water did you use?"," **Interviewee**: Oh, it was a lot of water. I believe we used 8 drums (200 liters) of water."
57,2022-11-16,36, **Interviewer**: Did you get all the three drums (200 liters) of cow manure from your cow house?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was all from my cow house."
57,2022-11-16,37, **Interviewer**: Where did you get water?, **Interviewee**: We got the water from a river because it is close by.
57,2022-11-16,38, **Interviewer**: How close is the river?, **Interviewee**: I think it is 100 meters. It's not far (laughs)
57,2022-11-16,39, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up?," **Interviewee**: We fed the bag for two straight days. On the second day the bag started inflating, and on the third day we started it."
57,2022-11-16,40, **Interviewer**: How much gas did it produce after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: On the first day, we lighted up the two burners and we were able to cook nsima and side dish (1 hour -- 1 hour 30 minutes). We cooked everything quite okay that we even turned off the burners after cooking everything -- it did not go off on its own, but we turned it off."
57,2022-11-16,41, **Interviewer**: On the second day?," **Interviewee**: It worked quite okay too -- and that is when we felt that our lives were about to changed. And, in the morning, in the afternoon we were able to cook without issues.... It only needs feeding!"
57,2022-11-16,42," **Interviewer**: Do you use it in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we do. As long as we feed the digester, it works quite okay."
57,2022-11-16,43, **Interviewer**: Are there times you fail to feed it?," **Interviewee**: If we do not feed the digester, it produces little gas; the gas is weaker compared to when the digester is fed."
57,2022-11-16,44, **Interviewer**: So what do you do when it is producing little gas?," **Interviewee**: We don't entertain ourselves to reach that level. So, we try to feed it daily with 3 or 2 buckets of cow manure day, and to this we add 2 buckets of water too."
57,2022-11-16,45," **Interviewer**: You have mentioned that sometimes it produces less fire than usual, especially if not fed. I can imagine that it happened at least once. So, under what circumstances do or did you fail to feed it?"," **Interviewee**: You know what happens in life, you cannot be there all the times. Sometimes we find ourselves away from home. But, even if we don't feed it for a day, it doesn't reach a level where it fails to produce enough fire for us to cook whatever we need. Therefore, it works that we even cook, but the period of not feeding needs not to go beyond a day or more."
57,2022-11-16,46, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: It just needs feeding with cow manure and water daily. And, the cow manure needs not to contain rubbish, and the water too needs not to contain soap. So, we make sure we have cow manure without trash in a bucket then add water, and then mix the feedstock thoroughly. Afterwards, we put the feedstock in the digester bag. So after feeding the digester, it starts producing gas and it also releases digestate at the outlet."
57,2022-11-16,47, **Interviewer**: What kind of feedstock do you feed it?, **Interviewee**: I only feed it with cow manure.
57,2022-11-16,48, **Interviewer**: How do you prepare the feedstock? Do you have a mixer or do you use hands?," **Interviewee**: To be honest, I mix the feedstock with hands -- I do not use anything else but hands."
57,2022-11-16,49, **Interviewer**: Whilst wearing gloves?," **Interviewee**: Ah, no. I just use bare hands."
57,2022-11-16,50, **Interviewer**: Don't you think you put yourself at risk?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) Ah no, after feeding it, we wash our hands thoroughly."
57,2022-11-16,51, **Interviewer**: Do you feel gross about handling dung?," **Interviewee**: No, it's just cow dung. Moreover, we handle it all the times when making manure as fertilizer as well."
57,2022-11-16,52," **Interviewer**: So you are saying you feed it with two buckets of cow manure and then add two buckets of water, right?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I usually feed it with two buckets of cow manure and two buckets of water everyday. Rarely do I feed it with 3 buckets or 1 bucket of cow manure - and, I do see a difference after feeding it with a single bucket of each of the feedstock. When I feed it with one bucket of cow manure and one bucket of water, it produces a relatively small amount of gas."
57,2022-11-16,53, **Interviewer**: Who is responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: I feed it, and I have a son who feeds it when I am not around too."
57,2022-11-16,54, **Interviewer**: How do you feel about the job? Or how does he feel about the job?," **Interviewee**: He is okay with it, and he even feeds it without me telling him."
57,2022-11-16,55," **Interviewer**: Oh, he is a hard worker."," **Interviewee**: Of course, he is a hard worker!"
57,2022-11-16,56, **Interviewer**: What were operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: They just told us that if we see any problem we should call them. So, in my case the handle on the gas valve which is located close to the stove broke as I was opening it. Then, I called Mphatso to report the issue, and then he sent Hope who came and fixed it."
57,2022-11-16,57, **Interviewer**: How long did it take them to come after you reported the issue to them?," **Interviewee**: It took me 3 days to report that the gas valve handle was broke, and the next day Hope came to fix it."
57,2022-11-16,58," **Interviewer**: Oh, that was fast."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they were so fast to come and fix it."
57,2022-11-16,59, **Interviewer**: Does it meet you needs?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it meets my cooking needs. However, sometimes the intensity of the fire declines as we are cooking. But, I see a great change in my life, and there is a huge difference with the way things were before the digester."
57,2022-11-16,60, **Interviewer**: What do you mean when you say the intensity of the fire declines? Can you elaborate on that?," **Interviewee**: I mean, when we cook for a long time the intensity of the fire declines; it is just more like the intensity of the fire is not just constant over time. So, that's a thing I note most of the times"
57,2022-11-16,61, **Interviewer**: How long does it take the fire to start losing intensity?," **Interviewee**: If we cook for more than one hour and 30 minutes, the intensity of the fire starts to drop."
57,2022-11-16,62, **Interviewer**: How long does it take the fire to go off completely?," **Interviewee**: That has never happened. It has never stopped whilst I'm cooking. It's just that the intensity drops after one hour 30 minutes, but it doesn't stop completely."
57,2022-11-16,63, **Interviewer**: What challenges have you faced?," **Interviewee**: The one challenge I had is what I have already mentioned -- and that is the challenge I had with the gas valve. But it wasn't a big problem because we were given a one year guarantee. So, any problem that happens in the first year Ecogen is responsible for its maintenance. Thus, when the gas valve broke I didn't spend any money. I just made the call."
57,2022-11-16,64," **Interviewer**: Some people say it does not work well or even not work at all when there is no sunlight, what is your take?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, no. If we feed it, even when there is no sun we cook without issues. I can't say we don\'t cook because of clouds, no! So I think the problem is that they don't feed it around that time -- because if we feed that time we don't see any problem."
57,2022-11-16,65," **Interviewer**: So, that's not a problem?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that's not a problem. Nevertheless, the other problem was that when we started using it people were saying the nsima did not taste good, and the texture was not good too. They said the food was bland and insipid. They were saying the nsima tasted like the nsima cooked at low temperature."
57,2022-11-16,66," **Interviewer**: Can we say it has improved now? Or, maybe you are now used to eating insipid food? (Laughs)"," **Interviewee**: (laughs) personally, I didn't have a problem with it -- I'm not a picky eater."
57,2022-11-16,67," **Interviewer**: Okay, how long did it take the gas valve handle to malfunction?"," **Interviewee**: The digester was commissioned in October, and the gas valve broke in April."
57,2022-11-16,68, **Interviewer**: When was it built again?," **Interviewee**: It was built in 2021, October."
57,2022-11-16,69, **Interviewer**: Have you seen something like this?," **Interviewee**: No, and the problem that happened at the gas valve I wasn't told. It was an odd problem for me. But, they told me that the system blocks sometimes because of water. So, they taught us how to open and remove water at the water trap. They also told us that sometimes the flow of gas is restricted in the pipe, so they told us to check and replace a filter, which looks like a wire mesh scourer in the system. They told us that when we see the black like things in the yellow pipe, then we should replace the filter."
57,2022-11-16,70, **Interviewer**: Have you ever faced this problem since they installed it?," **Interviewee**: No, it has never occurred. The only replacement we have done thus far is of the gas valve."
57,2022-11-16,71, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of your digester?," **Interviewee**: My digester is in perfect condition. I am able to cook everything quite okay -- I do not see any problem; whenever we want to use biogas, it does not run out of gas; when it is off it is because we have switched it off on purpose."
57,2022-11-16,72," **Interviewer**: From October of last year day to this point it's a long time, how have you managed to keep it working? What do you do?"," **Interviewee**: I just use it as I was advised by the installers like I said. I feed it as I was taught. Because one thing about digester is that they need daily feeding to produce fire, and I do just that."
57,2022-11-16,73," **Interviewer**: Right now, do you use biogas strictly? Or, you also use other methods?"," **Interviewee**: To be honest with you I like cooking on biogas. I don't like using firewood. Some other times though my children do use firewood to warm water for bathing. But, we use biogas most of the times."
57,2022-11-16,74, **Interviewer**: Why do your children sometimes use firewood when they have biogas? Is it that they do not like biogas?, **Interviewee**: They just feel like it is not right to use a big heavily sooted pot on the biogas stove (laughs heavily). It's just their preference.
57,2022-11-16,75, **Interviewer**: Do you still use cow manure as fertilizer on your farms?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we still use it as fertilizer. We get a lot of cow manure from the cows such that its supply exceeds the demand of the digester."
57,2022-11-16,76, **Interviewer**: How to you use the fertilizer?," **Interviewee**: Just like in the past \[put it a pit, and then take it to the farm\]. As for the effluent, we get from the digester we do not use it raw. We dilute it with water before using it as fertilizer because it is too strong."
57,2022-11-16,77, **Interviewer**: How to dilute it?, **Interviewee**: They advised us to dilute 5 liters of effluent with 20 liter of water.
57,2022-11-16,78, **Interviewer**: Does it work?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it works. But, the last time I tried it I was skeptical about it so I diluted 10 liters of effluent with 20 liters of water because I just felt like diluting 5 liters with 20 literswas not right. I felt like the fertilizer would be weak and not work. Nevertheless, after using it worked okay."
57,2022-11-16,79," **Interviewer**: So this year, are you not buying in organic fertilizer, you will use the effluent?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, this year I will use fertilizer from the digester. Once the rains start, I'll plant my crops and I'll use the effluent from the digester (laughs)."
57,2022-11-16,80, **Interviewer**: I hope I will not hear from you complaining about it; that all the maize has wilted., **Interviewee**: No (laughs). I will grow maize on one side with the effluent so that other people will learn about the bio-fertilizer from me.
57,2022-11-16,81, **Interviewer**: Why are you not going to use only the effluent on your crops?," **Interviewee**: No, I have to divide the fields."
57,2022-11-16,82, **Interviewer**: Why?, **Interviewee**: I should divide based on the fertilizer.
57,2022-11-16,83, **Interviewer**: What do you mean?," **Interviewee**: I haven't harvested the effluent, it's still there. And, I don't know how much I will collect from the digester, and also I don't have enough buckets, so I don't think I will collect enough."
57,2022-11-16,84, **Interviewer**: How much effluent of you collected so far?, **Interviewee**: The bucket I use for collection effluent is almost full more -- it has enough fertilizer.
57,2022-11-16,85, **Interviewer**: Did you line the hole for the digester bag or effluent collection?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't. The digester bag was simply placed in the hole."
57,2022-11-16,86, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you about lining it?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't explain that to me. They just advised us to dig a hole which the digester bag would fit into perfect."
57,2022-11-16,87, **Interviewer**: How big was the hole?, **Interviewee**: The hole was 100 meter deep \[100 cm\] and the other dimensions I have forgotten.
57,2022-11-16,88, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: When we got the materials we didn\'t ask\... But, I do think they explained that it's imported. You know it's difficult to remember things when you are old."
57,2022-11-16,89, **Interviewer**: We are remaining with 3 questions. What has been the biggest change in your life since you've got the digester?," **Interviewee**: Now, I cook with ease. My eyes don't get watery when I'm cooking -- Now, I cook things fast. Also, I'm able to make fertilizer from the digester."
57,2022-11-16,90, **Interviewer**: Do you think it's helping you to save money?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I am saving a lot of money. The money I was spending on charcoal and firewood I'm using it to buy other household necessities. Moreover, with the way the price of fertilizer has gone up, I am expecting to save a lot more."
57,2022-11-16,91, **Interviewer**: We are the remaining with two questions. What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: My only wish now is that I should use the digester for lighting; on top of cooking, I would also like to use it for lighting. So, I think biogas can be better if lighting can also be included in its system. That said biogas has changed my life especially because I am able to cook things fast."
57,2022-11-16,92, **Interviewer**: What are the cons of biogas?," **Interviewee**: The other drawback is that it produces strong odor after closing the stove while the gas valve outside is open. Therefore, you need to close the gas valve outside first before turning off the stove to avoid the smell. So, that is a major drawback, and it mostly happens when children are using it, as they tend to forget to close the gas valves."
57,2022-11-16,93, **Interviewer**: If you could have designed your own waste your energy intervention what would you have chosen instead?," **Interviewee**: Excerpt biogas what else can I wish for -- I cannot say I would wish to cook on electric cookers because this is a remote area and has no electricity lines. However, if the government can bring electricity, I would go for electric cookers. It\`s far much better than cooking on firewood."
57,2022-11-16,94, **Interviewer**: Why do you hate cooking on firewood? What's wrong with that?," **Interviewee**: Of course, we cook on firewood but it is not easy to find wood. And, it's very tough for us women to stand eye redness and tearing that happens because of the smoke when cooking on firewood especially if it\`s wet wood - it's not good at all! It very bad (laughs)"
57,2022-11-16,95, **Interviewer**: That was my last question. Before closing do you have anything else to say?," **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming to interview me. My plea is that those that do not use biogas should consider using it because it makes cooking easy and fast. And, I'm thankful to Ecogen for bringing the biogas here. I do receive a lot of visitors coming to see and admire the digester, and most people are becoming interested in biogas. So, it's a joyful thing to have. So, I'm just happy to have it, and it's good that the payment scheme is fair -- so everything is good!"
57,2022-11-16,96," **Interviewer**: You have said you are supposed to pay the money in 2 years. A year has gone now, have you paid have of it? (laughs)"," **Interviewee**: I have not paid more than half. But, I am sure in 2023, I will finish paying the debt."
57,2022-11-16,97," **Interviewer**: Oh, nice. I hope I will not hear that they came to taken off because you failed to pay the debt.", **Interviewee**: (Laughs) I'll finish. And I'll do anything to finish the debt.
57,2022-11-16,98, **Interviewer**: Great. Thanks for the interview., **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming too.
58,2022-11-16,1," **Interviewer**: First off, where did the digester originate from?", **Interviewee**: It came from a company called Ecogen.
58,2022-11-16,2, **Interviewer**: Who designed it?, **Interviewee**: The same company designed it.
58,2022-11-16,3," **Interviewer**: Okay, who funded it?"," **Interviewee**: Ecogen installed the system here, so that they could occupy our premises as their office. Thus, instead of paying cash for the digester, we agreed that they should use our premises for some months, I think it's 6 or 8 months. I'll need to check my records to confirm the duration though."
58,2022-11-16,4, **Interviewer**: Sure. Who built it?," **Interviewee**: Again, Ecogen built it."
58,2022-11-16,5, **Interviewer**: How many people from Ecogen installed it?," **Interviewee**: In the first place, three people came, but they let one man to do the installation."
58,2022-11-16,6," **Interviewer**: Okay, how many people from your organization were involved in the installation or construction phase?", **Interviewee**: The people from Ecogen did everything. No person from our office was involved in the installation or construction phase.
58,2022-11-16,7, **Interviewer**: What was your role as \[location redacted\]?," **Interviewee**: Our role was to oversee the work, but then we didn't have any experience with it, so we couldn't provide expertise. So, we were only there to see that it was installed and to use it after."
58,2022-11-16,8, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations as \[location redacted\]?," **Interviewee**: Our expectation was to enjoy the benefits of biogas namely; use it for cooking, secondly, they told us that we would be getting bio-fertilizer, and lastly we expected to conserve the environment because by using the digester it meant that we wouldn't cut trees as well as use inorganic compounds as fertilizer that harm the environment."
58,2022-11-16,9," **Interviewer**: So, from my understanding you were told about bio-fertilizer as well as that you would be getting energy for cooking. Apart from this, was there anything else you were told i.e. that could use it for lighting?"," **Interviewee**: The system we have here doesn't provide lighting. But they told us that it's possible to get energy for lighting with a different digester system. If I'm not mistaken, they said our digester produces a relatively small amount of gas, so it's hard to use it for lighting as well. But, then our concern was not on lighting, so we didn't mind a lot about that."
58,2022-11-16,10, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: After installation, the only taught us how to operate it; they simply showed us how to switch on and off."
58,2022-11-16,11, **Interviewer**: I can also imagine they told you about feedstock preparation and all that...," **Interviewee**: Yeah, they told us what to feed it with, and what not to feed it, and how many hours we would be getting out of it - so it was just basic information to keep it running."
58,2022-11-16,12, **Interviewer**: How many cooking hours were you told you would be getting out of your digester?, **Interviewee**: They said the maximum cooking time is 4-hours a day.
58,2022-11-16,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, did you learn about its maintenance?"," **Interviewee**: We were not trained on maintenance. They promised us that when the digester is damaged or faulty they will be responsible for its maintenance for a certain period. But, since it was installed, we haven't had any issues."
58,2022-11-16,14," **Interviewer**: You are saying your expectation was to use it for cooking and as a bio-fertilizer. I can imagine this was a need for you, so how did you manage to meet these needs before the digester?"," **Interviewee**: As \[name redacted\], we encourage the use of organic fertilizer as well as clean cooking, and we\'ve been doing this before the system was installed. For example, we harvest urine and human manure to make compost, so biogas enhanced our way of doing things in regards to use of organic fertilizer."
58,2022-11-16,15," **Interviewer**: To run a digester you need cow manure at one point or the other, where is your source of cow manure?"," **Interviewee**: We use kitchen waste, for example, vegetables leftovers as the primary feedstock. And, sometimes when we find cow manure, we use it but it's a rare occurrence."
58,2022-11-16,16," **Interviewer**: What times do you find cow manure, and what times do you use it?"," **Interviewee**: We do not have a specific time we use dung, and if we have used dung before it's only once or twice because we had it at that point."
58,2022-11-16,17, **Interviewer**: How did you manage get dung that time?," **Interviewee**: One time our executive director went to Mangochi -- Monkey Bay, and got some there."
58,2022-11-16,18, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock i.e. food waste before the digester?," **Interviewee**: Like I said earlier on, we make compost, so we use food waste for composting."
58,2022-11-16,19, **Interviewer**: How did you start up your digester?," **Interviewee**: In the very beginning, we used fresh cow dung to start up the gas production process. Then, after final installation, and after some countable weeks our digester was ready, and we started using it. After that, that's when we started feeding it with food waste."
58,2022-11-16,20," **Interviewer**: How many bags of cow dung did you use? And, how much water did you use too?"," **Interviewee**: Ecogen was responsible for this task, so I'm not quite sure about the quantities of cow dung and water which they used. But, if I'm not mistaken, they used one bag (50kg) of cow dung. And after a week or two, they realize that it wasn't responding according to their expectation. So, they fed it with another bag of 50 kgs. So in total, I can say they used 100kg of cow manure -- Though, I'm not very sure on this because it was Ecogen's responsibility."
58,2022-11-16,21, **Interviewer**: How much water did you add?," **Interviewee**: If I'm not mistaken, they gave us a ratio of one to three or four. That is the ratio of cow dung to water. So, there was more water in the feedstock, and we use the same ration to make feedstock now."
58,2022-11-16,22, **Interviewer**: How long did it take to start up?," **Interviewee**: They told us that in normal circumstances it takes three weeks. But, around that, time the weather was cool, so it's took one month and two weeks."
58,2022-11-16,23, **Interviewer**: So temperature affects the duration of starting up?," **Interviewee**: Yeah -- according to our experience and what we were told, that's true."
58,2022-11-16,24," **Interviewer**: How did your digester work after commissioning? Or, how much cooking time did you get from it?"," **Interviewee**: Like I said earlier on, they promised us that the maximum cooking time we would be getting from it in a day was 4 hours, if the bag is full. But, from our experience, we have never used it for 4 hours even when the bag was full like they said. The maximum cooking hours we got from it when the bag was full is 2 hours."
58,2022-11-16,25," **Interviewer**: Even now, you still get 2 hours?"," **Interviewee**: We don\'t normally use it continuously for 2 hours. So, sometimes you use it for 20 minutes for the whole day. Sometimes, we use it for an hour cumulatively."
58,2022-11-16,26, **Interviewer**: What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: The main thing is about feeding it constantly to have enough gas. So, for us to use it regularly, we constantly feed it. Also, if you want to use it to make sure that the gas valves are open in order to get gas at the stove. So, basically it's about feeding it and controlling the stove."
58,2022-11-16,27, **Interviewer**: How do you prepare feedstock?," **Interviewee**: It's basic; we remove the hard indecomposable things like bones and then crush the rest of the feedstock. Afterwards, we fill water not contaminated with soap, and then feed the digester."
58,2022-11-16,28, **Interviewer**: How often do you feed it?, **Interviewee**: We feed it on daily basis but the quantity is not the same every single day because we only depend on food leftovers which varies everyday
58,2022-11-16,29," **Interviewer**: On average, how much feedstock do you feed it with?"," **Interviewee**: On average, I can say we feed it with 2 kgs of food waste."
58,2022-11-16,30, **Interviewer**: I want to have at least an idea of how much food waste is generated. How many people are here?," **Interviewee**: We are mostly 3 people -- sometimes, we are 4 or 7 people. In a week, I can say 3 people are here in 5 days."
58,2022-11-16,31, **Interviewer**: How long have you used it again?, **Interviewee**: It was installed in June or July. I remember it was winter season that time. It's been 5 months now.
58,2022-11-16,32, **Interviewer**: Does it meet your needs?," **Interviewee**: It meets our needs, but it didn't meet our expectation in regards to what they told us. For example, I did mention that they told us that we would be getting 4 hours of cooking time, but unfortunately even when the bag is full it doesn't last up to 4 hours. So I can simply say we are not getting exactly what we were promised. In regards to bio-fertilizer, I can say we are getting what we expected."
58,2022-11-16,33," **Interviewer**: What do you get from your digester, is it effluent or digestate?", **Interviewee**: We get effluent (liquid)
58,2022-11-16,34, **Interviewer**: What do you use it?, **Interviewee**: We use it as fertilizer for our vegetable garden and fruits.
58,2022-11-16,35," **Interviewer**: Some of the users I have talked to use the effluent as a pesticide, do you use it as pesticide?"," **Interviewee**: No, we only use it as fertilizer, and that's new information to me -- I had no idea about that."
58,2022-11-16,36," **Interviewer**: Yeah, what they do is add ginger or pepper to the effluent, and then put it a sprayer. So, they spray vegetables, maize and whatever with the effluent, and they say it works."," **Interviewee**: Oh, that's interesting. Maybe we should try it."
58,2022-11-16,37," **Interviewer**: It's been 5 months now since it was installed, what challenges do you have or have you faced?"," **Interviewee**: There haven't been many challenges. The only thing is that we generate and feed it with a kilogram or two per day, which I feel is not enough. So it's a challenge to buy food waste from the market, or to ask from other people to provide. Except that, I don't see any challenge."
58,2022-11-16,38," **Interviewer**: Were you given information on a paper about common problems associated with digester failures, their causes and solution? For example, were you given information that if a bag shrinks, it means there is a leakage or it needs to be fed etc."," **Interviewee**: We were only communicated that if we see it shrinking we should feed it. In regards to troubleshooting and solving issues, that information was not given to us. But, like I said, Ecogen is in our premises and we agreed that they are responsible for its maintenance. So, I believe at the end of our agreement, when they are handing over the responsibility, they will provide us with that information because that's the only way we can maintain it."
58,2022-11-16,39," **Interviewer**: Has the digester ever malfunctioned? I mean, has there been a day where you wanted to use it but failed?"," **Interviewee**: No, if it doesn't work, it means there's no gas because it hasn't been fed. But, it has never malfunctioned."
58,2022-11-16,40," **Interviewer**: So, are there certain times you fail to feed it that it reaches a point you fail to cook as a consequence?"," **Interviewee**: It doesn't necessarily stop working, but it may work for 5 minutes or so then go off because it has run out of gas."
58,2022-11-16,41, **Interviewer**: What do you do if it runs out of gas while cooking?," **Interviewee**: We have other methods of cooking. For example, we use LPG gas, and sometimes we use a fuel-efficient cook stove that was built at our premises, so we use two or three pieces of wood to cook."
58,2022-11-16,42, **Interviewer**: Where do you get the wood?, **Interviewee**: We have trees around from which we get dead wood.
58,2022-11-16,43, **Interviewer**: We have done 80% of our interview. We are remaining with 20%. How much did the reactor cost?, **Interviewee**: It's worthK500000.
58,2022-11-16,44," **Interviewer**: Oh, that's a lot."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it is."
58,2022-11-16,45, **Interviewer**: Did you or your organization contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: We provide them space for their office. The agreement was that they would install us a digester and we would provide space for their offices.
58,2022-11-16,46, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: Of course, it's imported but I don't know where exactly it comes from."
58,2022-11-16,47," **Interviewer**: Some digester bags are placed in the hole that is lined with a brick wall or plaster, is your digester now lined?"," **Interviewee**: No, the hole is not lined."
58,2022-11-16,48, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that it is supposed to be lined?," **Interviewee**: No, they didn't."
58,2022-11-16,49," **Interviewer**: We are remaining with two questions, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Personally, I think biogas is a good innovation because it is used as a source of renewable energy. Secondly, it can be used as a source of bio-fertilizer. And, I think it is also a good innovation for the reason that it mitigates the effects of climate change. And, most of all it's a clean source of energy. So, I have nothing but positive things to say about it."
58,2022-11-16,50, **Interviewer**: There is nothing perfect in this world; everything has its limitation and negative side. What are the cons of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I can say it's costly, so it can't be accessed by an average person. In regards to the system itself, I can't think of anything else negative."
58,2022-11-16,51," **Interviewer**: Last one, if you could have designed your own energy or waste intervention, what could you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I would have reduced the size of the digester, I think it's too big and it occupies a lot of space. Secondly, I would have worked around it to increase the cooking time it generates or produces. As I said, they said it gives 4 hours but unfortunately, it only gives us 2 hours or less."
58,2022-11-16,52," **Interviewer**: Thanks for the interview, any last words.", **Interviewee**: There is nothing. Thanks for calling. Good luck with your projects.
59,2022-11-17,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digesters originate from?," **Interviewee**: I don't remember because many years have passed. But I can only recall that it came here with one woman who came by a car. But, before that people were called for a community meeting where they were briefed about the biogas project. It was communicated there that five people in our area would benefit from the project, and would go for training. After the training, the five people were expected to be teaching other people regarding biogas. Of course, I myself did not attend the meeting I was just told. After some days, the installers came to my house and advised me to dig a hole and to find fresh cow manure, so that they could install the digester. So, we dug a big hole the height of me -- it was very big, then we placed a bag in the hole. Then, we fed it with 50 buckets of water and 5 bags of fresh cow manure. And, I remember we mixed the feedstock using our bare hands. They promised us gloves, gumboots and other stuff, but we never got the items.They also told us that with the digester we would be cooking on it, and even charge our phones. The sad part about the digester was that around that time, there were some other community projects, for example, there was a road project and a social cash transfer program, but the community leaders decided not to involve us in the projects because we were involved in the biogas project. They said that we would get money after the biogas training or seminar, so we had to allow other people to benefit too. So, we lost many other opportunities for a year or two because of the biogas project. Moreover, the saddest part is that when the digester was commissioned it didn't work, so we lost a lot of things on something that didn't even work."
59,2022-11-17,2, **Interviewer**: When was it built ?," **Interviewee**: It's been 3 years, if not 5 years."
59,2022-11-17,3," **Interviewer**: So, you are saying you dug the hole?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I did."
59,2022-11-17,4, **Interviewer**: How many were you?, **Interviewee**: I dug the hole with my first-born son. He supported me because he saw that I could not manage to dig it alone. The hole was a big one just like a dug well -- It was deep that I could not manage to get out from. So my son seeing this thought of helping me.
59,2022-11-17,5, **Interviewer**: You are saying you were asked to find 5 bags of cow manure and 50 buckets of water. Where did you get these things?," **Interviewee**: I didn\'t have cows, so I asked cow owners within the community to share me cow manure."
59,2022-11-17,6, **Interviewer**: How many people sourced and prepared the feedstock?," **Interviewee**: I did this with my grandchildren. But, we didn't do the job in a single day because it was impossible to gather that amount of cow manure and water in a day. And, I have to say that we abused the children, because once they got home from school we were immediately asking them source the feedstock, and they were doing this job day and night."
59,2022-11-17,7," **Interviewer**: Oh, that was something."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was a lot of work. And, there was a lot of shouting to get the young children working -- and, I promised them that once I completed the trainings, I would give them some money from the training allowance. But, the promise was never fulfilled as I didn't go for training."
59,2022-11-17,8, **Interviewer**: (laughs) oh," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I felt that was one way of motivating them."
59,2022-11-17,9, **Interviewer**: I see. How many children are we talking about?, **Interviewee**: I have 5 or 6 grand children.
59,2022-11-17,10, **Interviewer**: Okay. How many people from the installation company came to install or construct the digester?," **Interviewee**: There were two people, but someone escorted them from Kachere Village. But, I don't know if the digesters worked in Kachere Village."
59,2022-11-17,11, **Interviewer**: Okay. How were you selected as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: In every village, one person was chosen. So, in my village I was the only one who was chosen. And, the fact that I was chosen by the community and the Chiefs I thought that I was honored, so I couldn't say no. So, they basically chose me because I was raising some orphans, so they thought it would help me to support the children. I think they thought that if I went to the training I would get money at the end of the training to support the orphans I was raising."
59,2022-11-17,12, **Interviewer**: Sure. What was the selection process like?," **Interviewee**: The first time the project implementers came, they had a meeting with the chief, and they asked the chief to conduct a community meeting. So, at the community meeting the people together with the chief agreed that I was the right person to get the digester."
59,2022-11-17,13," **Interviewer**: I have seen people chosen by the chiefs and the community to be given something, but refusing to accept the thing. Why did you accept the digester to be built here?"," **Interviewee**: We didn't know what was going to happen in the future, so we simply accepted it because the people and chief chose us. Had we known that things would pan out the way they did, we wouldn't have accepted it at all. And, even some people started making fun of us for accepting it."
59,2022-11-17,14," **Interviewer**: Who was doing that, and why?"," **Interviewee**: The people thought we had worked for nothing, so they were talking all sorts of things (laughs). The young people especially were making fun of me saying why an old woman like me was busy doing such a worthless job."
59,2022-11-17,15, **Interviewer**: Tough! Did the project implementers attend the meeting?," **Interviewee**: No, it was just a community meeting."
59,2022-11-17,16, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?," **Interviewee**: No, I didn't. I was expecting to learn about biogas at the trainings, because we were told that we would go for training before installation of the digesters commenced. So, we were so surprised to see the installers asking us to source and prepare feedstock before the training. But, we didn't say anything because we expected the training later."
59,2022-11-17,17," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: We expected to go for biogas training and get training allowance at the end of the training. So, after the training I expected to use the training allowance to buy at least a goat or a chicken."
59,2022-11-17,18, **Interviewer**: How did you expect the digester to help you?," **Interviewee**: The way the installers explained things, we were so convinced that we would use the digester for cooking. So, we expected to stop searching for firewood because here we source firewood in fields. We don't buy firewood because we can't afford it. Firewood needs people who have money. So, when we go the field to farm, we also source firewood there. The other thing is that we expected to be charging our phones using the digester -- But nothing happened, zero!"
59,2022-11-17,19, **Interviewer**: Do you use charcoal?," **Interviewee**: I never used charcoal, because it needs a lot of money. So, it's only rich people who use charcoal in this village."
59,2022-11-17,20," **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive? I mean, you didn't receive any training, right?", **Interviewee**: We didn't go for training.
59,2022-11-17,21," **Interviewer**: Then, how were you able to operate it?"," **Interviewee**: The project implementers showed us how to operate it. Then, they told us that we should be using a matchstick to light up the fire, and all that. And, since we didn't know anything about it, we expected to learn more about it, for example, its benefit and importance after commissioning it. But the sad thing is that it didn't work at all."
59,2022-11-17,22, **Interviewer**: How prepared to run or operate the digester did you feel you were?, **Interviewee**: I expected it to go for training after commissioning. So I felt like then I would have had skills and knowledge to operate it.
59,2022-11-17,23, **Interviewer**: How did it work after the commission? I understand you didn'tuse it., **Interviewee**: It didn't work at all.
59,2022-11-17,24, **Interviewer**: No even once?, **Interviewee**: I didn't produce any flame. So we didn\'t even try to boil water for hand washing.
59,2022-11-17,25, **Interviewer**: So after trying to start it up and seeing that it failed. What did the installers say?," **Interviewee**: After it was installed, they never came to see if it worked or not."
59,2022-11-17,26, **Interviewer**: Did you try to start it up yourself? Were the installers there when you were trying to startit up?," **Interviewee**: The installers didn't come to commission it. People from Kachere came to commission it. When they came, they taught us how to light up the gas, but when they tried to light up the flame, it didn't work. So, we just abandoned it afterwards."
59,2022-11-17,27, **Interviewer**: Who were these people from Kachere? Was it extension workers or government officials?," **Interviewee**: No, beneficiaries just like us from Kachere came. So, we don't know if they were trained or not."
59,2022-11-17,28, **Interviewer**: How many were they?, **Interviewee**: They were 2.
59,2022-11-17,29, **Interviewer**: How people were expected to use the gas?," **Interviewee**: We were 6 people. Two were my children, the other 3 were orphans I was raising."
59,2022-11-17,30," **Interviewer**: Okay, and you expected to use the gas for cooking only. What were the operation requirements?", **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us about the requirements. They didn't tell us which materials we would need to keep it running.
59,2022-11-17,31, **Interviewer**: You mean they didn't tell you about feeding?," **Interviewee**: They told us about feeding when we were trying to make the first charge. That's when they told us about the 50 buckets (20 liters) of water and five bags (50 Kgs) of cow manure. But when we feed it with this, it didn't work. So that's when we just abandoned it."
59,2022-11-17,32, **Interviewer**: Did you feed it after the first charge?," **Interviewee**: No, we didn't feed it again. So, the bag deflated after some time. It was tough. We were only abused."
59,2022-11-17,33, **Interviewer**: What were maintenance requirements?, **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us anything about maintenance as well.
59,2022-11-17,34," **Interviewer**: so, what are the challenges?"," **Interviewee**: The challenge we faced was that people were listed as beneficiaries in various other NGO projects, but the chiefs said that our names should not be listed. He said because we would go for a biogas seminar, it was not proper for us to get other benefits as well. So, our friends were involved in other projects and we able to benefit money and other things as a result they were able to supporttheir family through the projects. As for us, we were only waiting to be called for a seminar or training on biogas."
59,2022-11-17,35, **Interviewer**: so you missed the other opportunities because you were involved in biogas project.," **Interviewee**: Yes, of course. We were not involved in another project because we got the digesters."
59,2022-11-17,36, **Interviewer**: Which projects are you talking about in particular?," **Interviewee**: There were a lot of projects that we were not involved in because of biogas. The first one was that we would not get involved in the construction of a community road program by MASAF (Malawi Social Action Fund). Also, people were given goats by NGOs, but our names were again not listed because we were installed digesters that didn't even work."
59,2022-11-17,37," **Interviewer**: When it didn't work, what did you do?"," **Interviewee**: I left it in the ground for two or three years. Then, I decided to take it out to prevent the plastic digester bag from decomposing in the ground. At first, I tried it to take it out to myself but I failed, as I'm a woman. Then, I hired five boys to take it out. So, they cut it a bit, take out the contents, and removed it."
59,2022-11-17,38, **Interviewer**: Did you pay them?," **Interviewee**: Of course, we did. I paid each one K2000 for the work. I even involve myself in some piecework to pay the boys. So, in total I paid K10000 to take the digester bag out of the hole. But, I took it out to help me with my roof that was leaking."
59,2022-11-17,39," **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of your digester today? If the installers call you today to find out about the digester, what would you say to them?"," **Interviewee**: I would ask them that did you give us the digester to guard over it. Why didn't you follow up on us? Because, one would expect the installers to follow up the equipment, but they didn't. And, that is what normally what happens when organizations come here. When people bring something to the community, they follow up to see progress and performance. But, these ones didn't. So, if they decided to bring us to court for damaging their equipment, we would accept the charges. And, our defense would be that they did not follow up and they didn't training us on anything. In regards of training, they told us to keep old clothes for the training. They said to learn about feedstock making we would need rags. So, we kept rags in the house waiting for the training."
59,2022-11-17,40," **Interviewer**: Oh, that was tough."," **Interviewee**: Yes, we suffered. Imagine, handling fresh manure with bare hands.Imaging kids handle fresh manure. We suffered a lot, mister."
59,2022-11-17,41, **Interviewer**: Why do you think the installers didn't come to follow-up?, **Interviewee**: I don't know why they didn't come again. I just don't know why they failed to come again and follow up.
59,2022-11-17,42," **Interviewer**: Okay. Now that it is not working, are you still using firewood for cooking?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we still do that. We get small pieces of firewood from the fields that we use for cooking our nsima."
59,2022-11-17,43, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end of interview. How much did reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: They didn't tell us how much money the reactor cost. And, they didn't say anything about money."
59,2022-11-17,44, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything?," **Interviewee**: It's only that I abused the littles ones because of the digester. When they came from school, I was ordering them to go source cow manure and water as I thought it would benefit them. I even suffered myself, because when I came from the field I was going directly to people's houses to source manure. Today, when I think about biogas, I feel sad that I caused pain to little children for nothing."
59,2022-11-17,45, **Interviewer**: What is your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: I have nothing to say about biogas other saying that it caused us to suffer. I'm only happy that you came, so that makes us think that you think about us. So, we are just hoping that something good will happen in the future. Thus, we would be grateful if next time; you would give us goats in place of biogas."
59,2022-11-17,46," **Interviewer**: Final question, if you could have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: I would choose an intervention of giving the community livestock such as goat, so that from there we can get manure, and support our families. Or, if there is a better intervention you think would help us, we are willing to accept it."
59,2022-11-17,47," **Interviewer**: You have to mention it yourself; so that people would not come up with an intervention, you may not like it, or something that may cause suffering as biogas did."," **Interviewee**: Then, I would just settle for an intervention that would give goats or any other livestock to the community."
59,2022-11-17,48, **Interviewer**: Sure. Thanks for the interview. Do you have any last words?," **Interviewee**: Thanks for coming and for thinking about us. In closing, I would simply say we need an intervention that can improve the lives of people in this community."
60,2022-12-12,1, **Interviewer**: Where did the digester originate from?," **Interviewee**: It has been a long time, so it is hard for me to remember. But, the people who brought it here are the ones who built it also -- I think the people brought the digesters to try them here."
60,2022-12-12,2," **Interviewer**: Oh, they brought the digester to try it out?"," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was try out."
60,2022-12-12,3, **Interviewer**: Who was trying out the digesters? Was it the government or a non-governmental organization?, **Interviewee**: It was a non-governmentalorganization.
60,2022-12-12,4, **Interviewer**: Was it UNDP?, **Interviewee**: It could be -- I am not sure.
60,2022-12-12,5, **Interviewer**: Who built it?, **Interviewee**: I think the non-governmental organization hired some contractors to build it here.
60,2022-12-12,6, **Interviewer**: Do you know the name of the contractor?," **Interviewee**: No, I do not know."
60,2022-12-12,7, **Interviewer**: How many people from the installation company were involved in the installation?," **Interviewee**: They were two, and they were coming with the clerk of Tradition Authority Nsanama."
60,2022-12-12,8, **Interviewer**: How many people from your side were involved in the construction process?, **Interviewee**: My son and I were responsible for dig the holes.
60,2022-12-12,9, **Interviewer**: How long did it take you to dig the holes?, **Interviewee**: It took us 3 days to dig the hole. It was a big hole and the ground was hard too that is why it took us some time.
60,2022-12-12,10, **Interviewer**: What was your other role?, **Interviewee**: We were also responsible for sourcing and preparing feedstock.
60,2022-12-12,11, **Interviewer**: How many were involved?," **Interviewee**: We were seven; my wife and four daughters were the ones who were busy collecting water and manure, while my son and I were responsible for mixing the feedstock."
60,2022-12-12,12, **Interviewer**: Where did you source manure?, **Interviewee**: We got fresh cow manure from our cow house. Some of it I got it from some one else.
60,2022-12-12,13, **Interviewer**: Did you buy?," **Interviewee**: No, he just gave me for free."
60,2022-12-12,14," **Interviewer**: How much cow manure did you get from there? And, how far is it from here?", **Interviewee**: It is not far from here.
60,2022-12-12,15, **Interviewer**: Like how far?, **Interviewee**: It can take 30 minutes to go back and forth.
60,2022-12-12,16," **Interviewer**: Okay, how much cow dung did you get from there?", **Interviewee**: I got one bag. I used a 90 kg sack bag.
60,2022-12-12,17, **Interviewer**: How much feedstock did you feed it to start it up?," **Interviewee**: They advised us to feed it with three bags (90 kgs). So, I used three bags of 90kgs of fresh cow manure and plenty of water too. I do not recall the exact amount of water, but we used a lot of water. After we fed the bag, it got full which meant that it had gas, but it did not produce fire."
60,2022-12-12,18," **Interviewer**: Oh, okay, so you got two other bags from you cow house?", **Interviewee**: Yeah!
60,2022-12-12,19, **Interviewer**: How many cows did you have?, **Interviewee**: I had seven cows.
60,2022-12-12,20, **Interviewer**: Where did you get the water?, **Interviewee**: We have a borehole somewhere there.
60,2022-12-12,21," **Interviewer**: That is less those 250 meters away. Okay, how were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: That I can remember. People were chosen because they had cows or goats. You know a digester cannot work without animal manure, so that is why goat and cow owners were chosen. So everyone who was given a digester had cows or goats, or had access to animal manure. But, most people who were chosen had goats or cows."
60,2022-12-12,22, **Interviewer**: Was there anyone who had no cows or goats who was chosen over anyone who had cows or goats?, **Interviewee**: I think all the people who were chosen had cows.
60,2022-12-12,23," **Interviewer**: So, what was the selection process like? Were people handpicked or the chiefs choose them?"," **Interviewee**: When the project implementers came, they had a meeting with the Area Development committee and outlined the requirements for the beneficiaries. Some of the requirements I have already mentioned, for example, a beneficiary was supposed to have cows or goats, or had access to animal manure. So, when they came the ADC chair who is the Traditional Authority (T/A) clerk directed here and to the people who had cows or goats, and the installers asserted if the person was eligible or not. So, as cow owner I was chosen."
60,2022-12-12,24," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were your expectations?"," **Interviewee**: My expectation was that I would use the digester, and then benefit from it. Sadly, the digester did not work, and I did not see any person who used it."
60,2022-12-12,25, **Interviewer**: What went wrong?," **Interviewee**: I do not know what went wrong. But, I believe the digesters had technical issues."
60,2022-12-12,26, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: It is not only here that the digester did not work. If it did not work here, I would have conceded that I was at fault. So, if I am not the reason for its failure, it leaves the digester and the installers. Then, the installer told us that they would bring solar panels to boost the digester. So, the digester had technical issues."
60,2022-12-12,27, **Interviewer**: How did you expect the digester to help you as a beneficiary?," **Interviewee**: The installers mentioned that as a beneficiary I would be able to use for cooking. Secondly, they mentioned that the digester would produce digestate that works as fertilizer."
60,2022-12-12,28, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that you could use it for lighting as well?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, I forgot that. The installers talked about using it for lighting as well. But, they said that they were here that time for using it for cooking only."
60,2022-12-12,29, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: We did not receive any training. And, I also talked with the ADC chair and he did not think that the other beneficiaries had trainings. He said he would have known if the other beneficiaries had trainings, because they are usually notified of such things in most cases."
60,2022-12-12,30, **Interviewer**: You are saying that your digester did not work. Tell me about it?," **Interviewee**: After we fed it we waited for some weeks, I think 3 or 4 weeks. The bag got full but when they switched on the stove, it did not work."
60,2022-12-12,31, **Interviewer**: Did you see any flame?, **Interviewee**: No. I did not see any flame.
60,2022-12-12,32," **Interviewer**: Okay, when the installers installed the digesters and saw that it was not working, what did they say?", **Interviewee**: They just said that we should not tamper with the digesters because they would come again to boost the digesters. Since then they have never came back.
60,2022-12-12,33, **Interviewer**: Like how?, **Interviewee**: They said they would bring solar panels to boost the efficiency of the digester.
60,2022-12-12,34," **Interviewer**: Okay, what were the operation requirements?"," **Interviewee**: They said that it requirement is to feed it with cow manure, and without cow manure, it does not work."
60,2022-12-12,35, **Interviewer**: How did you prepare the feedstock? I mean you can\`t just have cow manure for it to function.," **Interviewee**: We only fed it during the time we tried to it start up period. So, at that time we placed cow manure in a bucket, add water, and then stir the feedstock thoroughly. Then after that, we poured the feedstock in the digester bag."
60,2022-12-12,36, **Interviewer**: How were you supposed to feed it after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: They did not tell us. Maybe, they could have told us, if it had worked. We were communicated many things because the digester did not work at all."
60,2022-12-12,37, **Interviewer**: What were the maintenance requirements?," **Interviewee**: They just told us that if we saw the bag shrinking, then we should feed it. That was the only thing they mentioned about maintenance."
60,2022-12-12,38, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for its maintenance?," **Interviewee**: We did not discuss that. I think, if it had worked, we would have gone for a training to learn about it. After that, we would have been able to maintain it ourselves."
60,2022-12-12,39, **Interviewer**: Why do you think you would have gone for training?," **Interviewee**: They cannot give you a new technology like that without training. It cannot work. So, they would have given training, if it had worked. Imagine, people bring boreholes in the communities all the time, but every time they train the people. So, if they train a community with boreholes and with a number of people trained in borehole management, what more a new thing like thing; what about something that the whole community has never seen?"
60,2022-12-12,40, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: The challenge is that the digesters did not work, and we did not know what to do afterwards. So, we did not see any benefit of biogas as the installers promised. For example, they promised us that we would be using it for cooking, and that they would bring solar panels to boost up the system, none of which happened -- Nothing they said ever happened."
60,2022-12-12,41, **Interviewer**: Why all these broken promises?," **Interviewee**: They did not know how to fix it, and I believe they only talked about solar to ease our hearts. They knew that they would not come with the solar system. If they were bringing solar panels, they would have brought it in the first place."
60,2022-12-12,42, **Interviewer**: Did you try to call them to follow up?," **Interviewee**: Yes, I did call them. And they were just saying that they would come, but they never did. Since, it has been a long time back we have lost all their contacts. I also talked with the T/A clerk; he was told that they would come as well."
60,2022-12-12,43, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of digester?, **Interviewee**: It is currently not working just like they left it. It never worked even for a single bit.
60,2022-12-12,44," **Interviewer**: What about the equipment, where is it?"," **Interviewee**: The digester bag is on the rooftop, and the other things were just dispersed on the ground. So after some time they were damaged and lost."
60,2022-12-12,45," **Interviewer**: How did it reach the stage? And, in your opinion, what caused it to fail?", **Interviewee**: I think the problem was the installers. They failed to make the digester work as we expected and as they explained to us.
60,2022-12-12,46, **Interviewer**: Why do you think the installers failed?," **Interviewee**: I only think that they did not know they were doing. So, I just think they did something wrong or they did not assembly the parts as they were supposed to be."
60,2022-12-12,47," **Interviewer**: In your opinion, why do you think the installers never returned?"," **Interviewee**: (Laughs) the installers knew there was nothing they could do fix it. So, there was no point incoming here again."
60,2022-12-12,48, **Interviewer**: We are going towards the end. How much did the digester cost?, **Interviewee**: They did not us about its cost.
60,2022-12-12,49, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: The only thing I contributed was cow manure and water.
60,2022-12-12,50, **Interviewer**: What was your opinion of biogas?," **Interviewee**: If you look at the objective of the whole project, it was premised on people of this community to use the digesters for lighting and firewood. As a result, the people would stop cutting down trees for cooking thereby saving the environment. So, I think if it was possible they could have just brought solar panels with good batteries, because solar panels do not require a lot work, they just need the sun. I believe, we can solar panels for cooking as well as lighting. I do not think biogas is good alternative because it needs cow manure, which is not easy to source and handle."
60,2022-12-12,51, **Interviewer**: We are about to finish the interview. I have two questions remaining. What is the future of biogas in my Malawi?," **Interviewee**: As far as I am concerned, I do not see any future with biogas. I am saying this because out of all the cow or goat owners who were given the digesters no one ever used it. So, I cannot see any future of it."
60,2022-12-12,52," **Interviewer**: Okay, I think you have answered my question partly or fully. My next question was, if you would have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?"," **Interviewee**: The only solution is solar panels. I think that solar panels are reliable and can work to the point were they could benefit communities. So, government or non-governmental organizations should consider solar panels because they could fit in our communities and benefit the people accordingly."
60,2022-12-12,53, **Interviewer**: Why would the fit here?," **Interviewee**: Nsanama is close to the lake, so it is hot."
60,2022-12-12,54," **Interviewer**: Thanks for the interview, do you have any final words.", **Interviewee**: I just want to thank you for coming.
61,2022-12-12,1,Where did the digester originate from?,"I have forgotten the name of the company... I am not sure if the company's name was Solar Energy, or something."
61,2022-12-12,2, **Interviewer**: Who funded it?," **Interviewee**: I think it was funded by a non-governmental organization, but the funds came through government because the project implementers came with people from the Phalombe District Counciland other people from State House. I believe people from the council were involved because government policy that time did not allow NGOs to work without the District Council."
61,2022-12-12,3, **Interviewer**: Who built it?," **Interviewee**: A company called solar energy built it. I am not sure about the name of the company though. But the man who is responsible for its installation was a man called \[name redacted\], an \[redacted\] man."
61,2022-12-12,4," **Interviewer**: How many people fromthe installation company came? And from your side, how many were you?"," **Interviewee**: They came two, and we were four, if not five."
61,2022-12-12,5, **Interviewer**: What was your role?, **Interviewee**: I bought bricks; I also paid the hired workers and everything else that had to do with the construction except for the digester bag and its accessories.
61,2022-12-12,6, **Interviewer**: How much did you pay the people who dug it?, **Interviewee**: I hired three people to dig the hole and I paid them K20000.
61,2022-12-12,7, **Interviewer**: You are also saying you lined it with a brick wall. How many bags of cement did you use?, **Interviewee**: I used two and a half bag.
61,2022-12-12,8, **Interviewer**: How much was a bag of cement then?, **Interviewee**: It was K8500.
61,2022-12-12,9," **Interviewer**: Oh, that was a lot. How much did you pay people who sourced feedstock and prepared it? And, how many were they?"," **Interviewee**: I paid the women K3, 000 each for collecting water, and they were three. And, I paid the same women K4, 000 to collect manure."
61,2022-12-12,10,Where did you get cow manure and water?,"We got water from a borehole that is at the school \[200 -- 300 meters\]. As for the manure, we got some from our cow house and some from other people within the village. I think we got it from two people and they just shared us for free."
61,2022-12-12,11,How far are they from your house?,15 or 20 minutes walk from here.
61,2022-12-12,12," **Interviewer**: How much did you pay for the bricks? And, how many bricks?", **Interviewee**: I used the bricks of K9000. I do not know how many were there.
61,2022-12-12,13," **Interviewer**: Okay, how were you selected as a beneficiary?"," **Interviewee**: I was selected because I had the requirements. As you know, you need fresh cow manure to run it, so I had cows. People in the community know those who have and those who do not have. So the people identified me, but I had the right to deny it too. But I accepted it because I wanted to try it out. Of course, some people had cows but refused it because they thought that it was involving and could not manage it."
61,2022-12-12,14, **Interviewer**: What was the selection process?," **Interviewee**: First, the project implementers liaised with Area Development Committee (ADC). And then, ADC mobilized chiefs to summon community people or VDC (Village development committee) to identify the beneficiaries. And then, I think ADC or VDC where briefed about biogas for two days by the implementers."
61,2022-12-12,15," **Interviewer**: So, how were you specifically chosen? Were you chosen at community level meeting or at ADC meeting because you are ADC chair?"," **Interviewee**: We had communication as ADC from the DPD \[Director of Planning and Development\] that the project implementers were coming, so we arranged for a meeting. I was personally called by the DPD to arrange themeeting. Then, when the project implementers came, they told us that we should identify people who had cows and the commitment to get the digesters, so that people could see how useful the digesters were to the community. So, yeah, we agreed to identify the people through the Chiefs and VDC -- So as an ADC chairperson who had cow and interest to own a digester, I was advised by the other members to get one."
61,2022-12-12,16, **Interviewer**: Did you know about biogas before?, **Interviewee**: I knew about biogas when they came and briefed us about it.
61,2022-12-12,17, **Interviewer**: What were your expectations?," **Interviewee**: I expected that once we got the digesters we would not be buying firewood, and even running around cutting trees for firewood. So we expected to benefit and to cook with ease."
61,2022-12-12,18," **Interviewer**: I can imagine that they told you that you would be using the digesters for cooking. Apart from this, what else did they tell you to expect?"," **Interviewee**: The main thing was that the digesters were for cooking. And they told us that with the right equipment, we could also use the gas for welding -- So that is what they told us."
61,2022-12-12,19, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that you could use it as fertilizer as well?," **Interviewee**: They told us that we could use the digestate as fertilizer. So we were using dry or fresh digestate as fertilizer, and it was working very well. And, I have to saythe only benefit I saw from the digester was that we got digestate from it. And, the digestate was strong enough that we did not need to add inorganic fertilizer to boost its strength."
61,2022-12-12,20, **Interviewer**: Did they tell you that you could use it for lighting too?," **Interviewee**: No, they did not say that. They just said that we could use it for cooking as well as a source of fertilizer."
61,2022-12-12,21, **Interviewer**: What kind of training did you receive?," **Interviewee**: The training we received was about its operation. First, they taught us how to make the initial feedstock. So they advised us to find five bags (50 kg) of fresh cow manure and a drum (200 liters) of water, and then mix it to have suitable slurry. After that, they advised us to wait for a week, if not two weeks for gas production process. And, they told us that we would see the bag getting full around that time, and indeed, it got full. And, even when we started the stove, it produced strong fire, however, that was only at the beginning. After sometime, the bag started shrinking despite feeding it, and eventually we found it of no use. Then, the rains came and submersed the digester bag in the hole. After that, it flipped over, and then it got buried."
61,2022-12-12,22," **Interviewer**: Okay, where did this training occur? And, who were the participants?"," **Interviewee**: We were just briefed by the project implementers, and people from the council were there too. So after that, the installers started coming to install the digesters."
61,2022-12-12,23, **Interviewer**: Let me get you crystal clear on this. Did you and the other beneficiaries get trained? Were the beneficiary trained?," **Interviewee**: Aaah, no. The beneficiaries I doubt if they were trained - frankly speaking, they were not trained. It is only that the project implementers brief ADC and the council about the project. So that is where we learned some of the things about biogas. And, I remember the ADC requested a thorough training for themselves and the beneficiaries because people thought that biogas was complex and needed sufficient skills and knowledge to be managed. But, I do not think they had enough funds to conduct the trainings. I think they had limited funds."
61,2022-12-12,24, **Interviewer**: Why do you say that?," **Interviewee**: Anyone could see that training was crucial, so only resources could have hampered the training."
61,2022-12-12,25, **Interviewer**: How did you meet your energy needs before the training?, **Interviewee**: I was using charcoal and firewood.
61,2022-12-12,26, **Interviewer**: Where did you get firewood?," **Interviewee**: We buy firewood but sometimes we get it from the trees around. But you cannot rely on the trees around because cooking on firewood consumes a lot of firewood as a result it can finish all the trees around. And, I do feel houses look respectable and are enjoyable when there are trees around. So, you cannot cut trees around because that is disaster."
61,2022-12-12,27, **Interviewer**: That is true. How much firewood and charcoal were you using?," **Interviewee**: It was a lot of firewood, but it is difficult to quantify it. So, roughly I can say we were using three bundles of firewood and two bags of charcoal per month."
61,2022-12-12,28," **Interviewer**: You are saying that time you had cows, and I believe this time you still have, how many cows did you have that time?", **Interviewee**: I had four cows.
61,2022-12-12,29, **Interviewer**: How did you manage your feedstock before the intervention?," **Interviewee**: I was only heaping cow manure for some time to process, and then around the growing season I was simply spreading the manure in the field."
61,2022-12-12,30, **Interviewer**: How did it work after commissioning?," **Interviewee**: On the first day, we did manage to cook nsima and beans around lunchtime. But, in the evening, it did not work at all \[Approximately 2 hours of cook time on the first day\]. I assumed that we exhausted the gas in the bag that day. The next day, I was able to make tea, and warm water for bathing \[30 minutes -- 1 hour\]. But from that time on, we could not manage to cook nsima. We were only able to cookside dish of eggs or fish \[approximately 30 minutes of cooking time\]. When we did put nsima on the stove the fire was going off as the nsima was simmering, them we used to continue with firewood and charcoal. And when we waited for sometime and switched it on again, the fire was coming strong but not for more than minute or two -- So that was the challenge we had with it."
61,2022-12-12,31," **Interviewer**: So, you were not able to cook in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening on it?"," **Interviewee**: Ah, not possible -- not possible. And even the other beneficiaries started complaining that they had wasted there money for nothing. We were just worried people that time -- we just wasted time - and they made us interact withcowmanure for nothing. But, if it had worked, people would not have complained about interacting with cow manure."
61,2022-12-12,32," **Interviewer**: Yeah, I have heard a lot of grumbling about it."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, and the people need to be compensated with powerful solar panels to usefor lighting and other things. That is the only way to say sorry to them -- Leaving them just like that is not fair -- It does not just feel right."
61,2022-12-12,33, **Interviewer**: I see. What were the operation requirements?," **Interviewee**: They advised us to feed it everyday with 20 kg of fresh cow manure mixed thoroughly with water, and people were doing that. But, I just do not know why it did not work. So because it was just an experiment, I believe they got something wrong -- Yeah, they told us that it was just a try out, so maybe the technology had and has issues."
61,2022-12-12,34, **Interviewer**: Perhaps. How did you prepare the feedstock?, **Interviewee**: Some were using hands; some were using sticks to mix the feedstock. The people did not have gloves for feedstock preparation.
61,2022-12-12,35," **Interviewer**: Oh, it was tough."," **Interviewee**: Yeah, it was causing itching and twitching on the fingertips right under the fingernails. So, sometimes to avoid this I was hiring people to make feedstock for us."
61,2022-12-12,36, **Interviewer**: How much were you paying them?,"It was not a lot, maybe K400 or K500."
61,2022-12-12,37, **Interviewer**: How much water were you adding to the 20 kg of feedstock?," **Interviewee**: They were not clear on that. They just advised us tomakefeedstock of good thickness, not too watery and not too thick as well."
61,2022-12-12,38, **Interviewer**: Who was responsible for feeding it?," **Interviewee**: My wife was responsible for feeding it. Sometimes, I was hiring people to make the feedstock. Sometimes, I was doing it myself."
61,2022-12-12,39, **Interviewer**: How did you feel about feeding it? Did you not feel that it was hard work or gross?," **Interviewee**: We accepted the digester, so it meant we accepted everything that came with it. If you accept something, you accept everything that comes along with it. It is like marriage -- if you marry someone, it means you have accepted everything about the other person."
61,2022-12-12,40," **Interviewer**: Sure, what were the maintenance requirements?"," **Interviewee**: As for my digester, it never malfunctioned. The only problem is that it got buried after the rains - you know our area is flood-prone."
61,2022-12-12,41," **Interviewer**: Tough, who was responsible for its maintenance?"," **Interviewee**: They advised us to call them when it had a problem. So, they gave us their numbers, but when we called them they could not be reach, and sometimes they did not just answer. But in their statements, they left us the numbers so that they would be following-up but they never followed up. Nevertheless, we had another group that came just to do research on the digesters. So, since the digesters were installed they are the only people that came to find out about the digesters."
61,2022-12-12,42," **Interviewer**: Okay, did it meet your needs?"," **Interviewee**: During the first day or week, it made us think that it would meet our needs, but it never did. So, after that we continued using charcoal and firewood."
61,2022-12-12,43, **Interviewer**: What were the challenges?," **Interviewee**: The digester did not just produce sufficient fire despite feeding it thoroughly. The only thing I was contented with the digester was that it was producing enough digestate and that the digestate was effective. Thus, the problem is that it never produced sufficient gas enough to help us."
61,2022-12-12,44," **Interviewer**: During that time, was the bag getting full?"," **Interviewee**: Yes, it was. And, it was even scaring us that it could burst. It was getting that full! And, when it was that full, it was making sound that it was forcing us to put something on the stove to get it a bit shrunk."
61,2022-12-12,45," **Interviewer**: So the bag was getting full, but it was not just producing enough fire?"," **Interviewee**: No, it was producing strong fire, but the fire was not taking long to go off at the stove."
61,2022-12-12,46, **Interviewer**: Like how many minutes?," **Interviewee**: Maybe 30 minutes at most, but during that time the intensity of the fire was slowly going down."
61,2022-12-12,47, **Interviewer**: How long did you use your digester before it stopped?, **Interviewee**: I used it for 5 months.
61,2022-12-12,48, **Interviewer**: Did you notice that it was leaking gas somewhere?," **Interviewee**: No, we did not."
61,2022-12-12,49, **Interviewer**: What did you do after it stopped working?," **Interviewee**: I did nothing because the bag got flipped over in the hole. There was nothing I could have done since the bag was heavy too. Then, it got buried and it is still buried today. If you could dig up the place, you would find it."
61,2022-12-12,50, **Interviewer**: Did you notify the installers or project implementers about this?," **Interviewee**: I tried to but as I said, their numbers were not going through. Then, I changed phones also, so I lost their contacts."
61,2022-12-12,51," **Interviewer**: Were you given information on in writing regarding technical problems of digesters, their and possible solutions?", **Interviewee**: No.
61,2022-12-12,52, **Interviewer**: What do you think about that kind of information and do you think it would have helped you?," **Interviewee**: Yes, it could have helped us because it would have been helping us to identify the issues, and then how to act afterwards to solve the issues -- it is disappointing that we didn\'t receive that kind of information."
61,2022-12-12,53, **Interviewer**: How would you describe the current state of your digester today?," **Interviewee**: I still have the equipment, for example, the stove. It is only the digester bag that is still buried in the ground. We could not get it out because there was so much manure and water in it.And, also we still have the inlet and outlet pipes, but they are seriously damaged."
61,2022-12-12,54," **Interviewer**: How did it reach this stage? And, in your opinion, what cause it?"," **Interviewee**: I think they were here to try out the digesters, so they did not fully understand how the digesters work and how they could help people. So, I think they just thought that it was a good innovation to help the people to stop using firewood and charcoal, but they did not understand its technicalities. Simply put, I think it was just an experiment, and at the end, it just showed that the digesters could not work."
61,2022-12-12,55, **Interviewer**: How do you meet your energy needs now? Do you still buy charcoal and firewood?," **Interviewee**: Yeah, we still do that."
61,2022-12-12,56, **Interviewer**: We are almost through with our interview. We have about five or six questions left. How much did the reactor cost?," **Interviewee**: I don't really remember what the cost was, but the mentioned something like K150, 000 -- yeah, I remember they mentioned that figure, though, it's been a long time to remember all that."
61,2022-12-12,57, **Interviewer**: Did you contribute anything in kind?, **Interviewee**: I only spent the money on bricks and labour. The rest of the things were theirs.
61,2022-12-12,58, **Interviewer**: What special items had to be imported from another country?," **Interviewee**: Ah, everything was from Malawi."
61,2022-12-12,59, **Interviewer**: Did the digester help you save money?," **Interviewee**: (laughs) I only maybe save money for 2 days. I cooked nsima on it for a day or two days, so I saved the moneywhich I could have used on firewood or charcoal... But, when it came, I felt excited that I was going to save money, my expectation was just too high."
61,2022-12-12,60," **Interviewer**: Okay, what is your opinion of biogas?"," **Interviewee**: Since it was a try out, I feel like the project implementers need to improve their innovation.... Initially, people here had interest in it, but when they saw that it was not benefiting the beneficiaries they lost interest."
61,2022-12-12,61, **Interviewer**: So people in Phalombe do not want biogas?," **Interviewee**: Ah, at first people had interest in biogas, but now I do not believe that they can embrace it. So, if they want to try out another innovation then it should be solar powered. Also, I feel biogas is hard to fit in our community because of the floods we usually get. So, it is very easy for the digester bags to get buried in soil after rain, because also the soil is not compact enough."
61,2022-12-12,62," **Interviewer**: If you would have designed your own waste or energy intervention, what could you have chosen instead?", **Interviewee**: I don't know if there are other new innovations happening other than biogas -- That said Ican only think of solar panels which can generate enough energy to help people cook. We just needed to mount solar panels on top our houses.
61,2022-12-12,63," **Interviewer**: Biogas, no?"," **Interviewee**: My friend, they way I saw it, I cannot manage it -- No, it should not come here again. Or, maybe if it is possible to use different feedstock then maybe it can work. But, I only know that it uses animal manure."
61,2022-12-12,64, **Interviewer**: Some digesters use food waste but the limitation is that there is little food left over at household level to meet its demand.," **Interviewee**: Yeah, that is true. And, you cannot go buy food baggage at the market because it is costly too. And, operating it with that can even be more expensive than charcoal."
61,2022-12-12,65," **Interviewer**: Yeah, what are your last words?"," **Interviewee**: The digesters brought a lot of hope to the community of Senior Chief \[name redacted\] -- and all the beneficiaries were happy to get a digester, and we thanked the donors that provided the digesters through the government. But, our happiness was short lived. At first, we thought we could benefit from the digesters, but we ended up benefiting nothing. So, if the donors want to help us and bring something again, if it is possible, they should bring another innovation, and not biogas."
61,2022-12-12,66, **Interviewer**: Interesting. Thanks for the interview.,NA
